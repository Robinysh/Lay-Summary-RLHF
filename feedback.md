1. Overall, I think the project is extremely well-executed! 
2. You are required to use the ACL template (see instructions). Please switch your Overleaft template to the ACL tempalte. Later if you want to submit this draft to the workshop, you don't need to change your template. You can merge all your reports in a single document and separate your milestones by section names.
3. Abstract is supposed to be a summary of the whole paper. If you only use abstracts to train your model, you probably can expect pretty good results. One potential research direction is to see what parts of the article is most relevant for the lay summarization. For example, literature review might be irrelevant to this task. Introduction and Conclusions are probably much more important than Methods and Results. Selecting the right subset of each article can improve your model efficiency and reduce input lenghtsï¼Œwhich allows you to feed in more retrieved background knowledge.
4. It is unlikely that your models will do well on all metrics. Try to focus on one or two metrics to optimize first. RAG is helpful for factuality but will it also help readability? 
5. Collaboration betweem small LLMs can be a very good approach, if you have enough resources. Each LLM can focus on one metric and later you can merge the results across LLMs. And you can do multiple iteractions to improve the lay summary incrementally.
