**Teamwork Contract**\[^1\]

**COLX 531**

**Lay Summarization of Biomedical Research Articles**

**Team Members:**

- Robin Yuen

- Mingcong Li

- Mandeep

- Qihan

**Goals:**

1. Project Goals:

   a.  Mandeep: experiment with novel and interesting techniques

   b.  Mingcong: complete the necessary milestones and explore
   interesting directions

   c.  Robin: learn new techniques and apply them to a complete
   project

   d.  Qihan: use this as a learning opportunity for both new
   experimental ideas and practical applications

1. Expected Obstacles:

   a.  How to allocate time between research vs. experimentation?
   Research interleaved with experimentation + keep the scope small and
   focused. Utilize the first week to develop baselines and after,
   iterate using newer approaches.

   b.  Should we submit an actual research paper? For now, we will
   commit to completing a technical report for the purpose of the
   class but if the results are sufficiently good, we will submit a
   paper.

   c.  How should we distribute work amongst ourselves given the linear
   process involved with research? We will each focus on a subset
   of research papers and then proceed with downstream tasks in
   accordance to what we learn.

   d.  How do we decide whether our current direction is a dead end vs
   insufficient allocation of time? Discuss internally and
   externally with more experienced researchers.

1. Going beyond: everyone is aiming for an A+ but we will try our best
   given the time limitations. If one or two team members choose to do more
   work than the others in order to get the team an A+, then the other
   team members will pay for a nice team dinner after the project ends.

**Meeting/Communication Norms:**

- Our preference for when and where meetings will be held: Monday (lab
  time) and Friday (2pm)

- We will meet outside of class 2 times a week using Slack

- We anticipate each meeting to take 1 hour

- We will have meeting agendas/minutes

  - The project manager for the week will be responsible for the meeting notes

- We will not have daily standups regarding progress

- When are team members generally not available:

  - Generally not available after 8pm and on weekends

**Work Norms:**

- On a weekly basis, work will be divided among team members in the
  following way based on each team member's prior experience and
  interests. Below are a few areas of focus for each week:

  - Prior research

  - Programming / Experimentation

  - DevOps/MLOps

- We expect the project to take 6-8 hours per week per person,
  including meeting time, to make the project successful

- The weekly deadlines will be set as the weekly lab official deadline

- If someone does not have time to follow through on a commitment, the
  team member will notify the team by Wednesday EOD

- Individual work will be reviewed by each team member in accordance
  to what we decide on Monday for the specific week

- If people have different opinions on the quality of work, then we
  will discuss collectively to reach a consensus

- Our habit is to make as much progress as possible to ensure that our individual
  work does not block the progress of a teammate's work

**Decision Making:**

- The project manager for each week will be:

  - Block 5 Week 4: Robin

  - Block 5 Finals Week: Mingcong

  - Block 6 Week 1: Mandeep

  - Block 6 Week 2: Qihan

  - Block 6 Week 3: Robin

  - Block 6 Week 4: Qihan

- We need 3/4 approval before making a decision

- If one person is fixated on a particular idea, then we will first
  try to discuss it internally and then if we cannot reach an
  agreement, then we will discuss it with Jian. We want to encourage
  each team member to propose novel ideas.
