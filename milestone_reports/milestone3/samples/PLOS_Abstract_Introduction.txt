Researchers have found that differences in gene regulation, such as changes in expression levels, can have important effects on evolution and health. These differences can be caused by genetic variations in the way that a gene is regulated, including by changes in the length of its RNA. Researchers are now focusing on understanding how genetic changes in the RNA can affect gene expression, specifically by looking at how different lengths of RNA are used in different individuals. This can help us understand how genetic variations in RNA regulation can affect the expression of different genes in different people.
Researchers have found that a live attenuated vaccine called SIVΔnef protects against a more virulent strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in rhesus macaques. The vaccine is thought to work by inducing a diverse and effective response from CD8 T cells. In order to better understand the mechanisms behind this protection, researchers used deep sequencing technology to identify regions of immune pressure and viral escape, as well as the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals. The results suggest that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted against more variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape. These changes expand the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes, defined as anentropic specificity, and generate de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period. The researchers conclude that the mechanisms behind the protection induced by SIVΔnef include anentropic specificity and increased response depth. This study is significant because it highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind vaccine efficacy, and suggests that future vaccines should focus on inducing anentropic specificity in the CD8 T cell response.
Candida albicans is a common cause of fungal diseases, including mucosal infections, which are the most frequent forms of fungal disease. The immune system uses a variety of ways to fight off these infections, but one of the most important ways is through neutrophils, which are specialized cells that are recruited to the site of infection and help kill the fungus. It is not completely understood how the immune system controls the response of neutrophils during mucosal infections with Candida albicans, but a recent study has shed some light on this process. The study found that interleukin-1 (IL-1), a type of signaling molecule that is released by cells when they are infected or injured, plays a critical role in controlling the response of neutrophils during these infections. Specifically, the study found that IL-1 is released from keratinocytes, which are the main type of cells that make up the skin and mucous membranes. This IL-1 then signals to endothelial cells, which are the main type of cells that make up the blood vessels, to produce a protein called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is important because it helps produce more neutrophils, which are the specialized cells that help fight off infections. This study has important implications for understanding how the immune system controls the response of neutrophils during mucosal infections and how we might be able to use this knowledge to develop new ways to treat these infections.
The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) started in 2000 to help people in 83 countries to get rid of a debilitating disease called lymphatic filariasis (LF). The programme is funded by donations of drugs from GlaxoSmithKline and Merck & Co, Inc. and is implemented through mass drug administration (MDA) to at-risk individuals every year. More than 1.9 billion treatments have been given to almost 600 million individuals in 48 countries over the first 8 years of the programme. This has resulted in the prevention of more than 6 million cases of hydrocele and 4 million cases of lymphedema, saving 32 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and resulting in numerous quality-of-life benefits. But what is the economic significance of these achievements? This study estimates that over the lifetimes of individuals protected from LF due to the first 8 years of the GPELF, US$21.8 billion of economic benefits will be gained by LF infected and non-infected individuals in MDA-treated areas, in addition to US$2.2 billion in health systems savings. The study leads to a better understanding of the GPELF's true overall impact on one of society's most debilitating and widespread tropical diseases.
Researchers have discovered that certain mutations in a gene called GBA cause a rare genetic disorder called Gaucher disease, which results in the accumulation of certain fats inside brain cells called neurons. Gaucher disease can cause symptoms such as hydrops fetalis, congenital ichthyosis, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenia, skeletal disease, brainstem dysfunction, intellectual disability, seizures, myoclonic movement, neuronal loss, astrogliosis, microgliosis, and perivascular accumulation of Gaucher cells. A recent study in medaka fish has shown that complete deficiency of the GBA gene can lead to a neuronopathic form of Gaucher disease, characterized by remarkable α-syn accumulation in the brain. These findings suggest that the association between GBA mutations and α-syn accumulation may be stronger in neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease than in the non-neuronopathic form.
The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is capable of inducing a strong immune response. It can escape from the phagosome and enter the cytosol, which is essential for the generation of long-lived CD8 T cells that provide protection. However, bacteria that are confined to a phagosome can suppress the adaptive response and negate the response to bacteria within the cytosol. Infection with a strain that cannot escape from the phagosome does not induce protective immunity. When co-infected with both strains, the presence of the bacteria confined to the phagosome impaired the protective response to the bacteria in the cytosol. The phagosome-confined bacteria suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to rapid IL-10 production. Blockade of the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88 during primary infection restored protective immunity. This study shows that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells.
Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type. A recent study found a genetic link between POAG and the SIX6 gene, which plays a role in ocular development. To better understand how SIX6 may contribute to glaucoma, the researchers sequenced the SIX6 gene in POAG cases and controls, identifying six nonsynonymous coding variants. They then tested these variants in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation assay, finding that five of the variants were hypomorphic or null and that the sixth variant was benign. The researchers also used a luciferase reporter assay to find a variant in the SIX6 enhancer that may increase SIX6 expression. Finally, they found that POAG patients homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele have a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the non-risk allele. These results suggest that SIX6 dysfunction may contribute to glaucoma.
The article describes the role of flagellar gene expression in the pathogenesis of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), a bacteria that causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Flagellar gene expression is regulated by a switch called the flagellar switch, which controls the production of flagella and the glucosylating toxins. The flagellar switch is a 154-bp sequence flanked by 21-bp inverted repeats, and its orientation determines whether or not flagellar and toxin genes are expressed. The authors provide evidence that the flagellar switch controls the production of flagella and the glucosylating toxins, and that flagellar gene expression is regulated post-transcription initiation. They also identify the tyrosine recombinase RecV as the recombinase responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch. The article highlights the importance of flagellar gene expression in the pathogenesis of C. difficile and identifies a new regulatory switch that controls the production of flagella and the glucosylating toxins.
Sporulation is a survival mechanism used by some bacteria that allows them to form highly resistant spores. The process of sporulation has been studied extensively in the model organism Bacillus subtilis, where it is divided into four main stages: early, middle, late, and maturation. Each stage is regulated by a specific sigma factor that controls the expression of genes specific to that stage. The function and regulation of these sigma factors have been studied in Clostridium difficile, an intestinal pathogen that forms spores. Unlike B. subtilis, C. difficile has a different morphological sequence of events during sporulation, and the activity of σF, σE, σG, and σK is not strictly conserved. The results suggest that the top level of the sporulation network is conserved in evolution, with the sigma factors acting as key regulators, but the sigma factors are not strictly required for the formation of heat-resistant spores in C. difficile. The study provides a platform for further investigations into the regulatory network and the effector genes during sporulation.
This paper presents a new framework for modeling the behavior of proteins that have multiple sites that can be modified by phosphorylation. These proteins are known to play a role in many biological processes, including cell cycle regulation. The proposed framework is based on the idea of a modified fraction, which describes the fraction of modified sites in the protein. The framework is able to accurately capture the dynamics of these systems without introducing many additional variables. As an example, the authors use the framework to model a checkpoint signaling pathway that regulates the timing of isotropic growth in a budding yeast cell. The authors show that this system exhibits bistable behavior, where a certain level of polar growth is required before the system switches from polar to isotropic growth. Overall, this paper provides a useful tool for modeling the behavior of multisite proteins and for understanding the mechanisms underlying cell cycle regulation.
This research aims to understand how bacterial cells communicate and coordinate their activities using a process called quorum sensing (QS). QS is a type of intercellular communication in which bacterial cells respond to a chemical signal called autoinducer-2 (AI-2). The researchers used a combination of experimental work and mathematical models to study the transport of AI-2 into bacterial cells and the interplay between different regulatory mechanisms. They identified a new regulatory element that was not previously known. They also used their findings to explain the genetic "switch" in E. coli QS circuitry, which is the way that the bacteria switch between two different behaviors. The researchers' findings highlight the importance of having the right balance between the strengths of different regulatory mechanisms in the proper functioning of QS.
Malaria continues to be a big problem in many parts of Africa. In many of these areas, there are also high levels of another type of parasite called helminths. Researchers in Gabon studied the relationship between two types of helminths (S. haematobium and Trichuris trichiura or hookworm) and malaria infections. They found that having both helminths infections increased the risk of malaria. However, the researchers found that this increased risk only applied to children under 10 years old. They also found that having both helminths infections did not increase the risk of malaria in children over 10 years old. This study shows that it is important to understand how different types of parasites interact with each other in order to better understand and treat them.
We studied how the immune system responds to Leishmania parasites. The parasites cause a disease called leishmaniasis, which affects millions of people worldwide. In this study, we focused on how the immune system responds to a type of leishmaniasis called visceral leishmaniasis. We found that a specific protein in the immune system, called IRF-5, helps to regulate the response to the parasites. We also found that the parasites may be able to use another protein, called HIF-1α, to evade the immune system. By studying how the immune system responds to these parasites, we hope to better understand how to treat and prevent leishmaniasis.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a serious illness that causes death in some cases. Some patients have a worse outcome than others, which is why it's important to identify those who are at higher risk of having a bad outcome. This article is a review of studies that have looked at the factors that can predict a bad outcome in VL patients. These factors include jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age under 5 and over 40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. The article also highlights the need for future studies that validate these prognostic factors to develop more effective models to help predict and manage the outcomes of VL patients.
Leishmaniasis is a group of diseases caused by parasites from the Leishmania genus. There are 54 named Leishmania species, and 20 of them can cause human diseases. These diseases are spread by bites from infected sand flies and are endemic in many regions of the world, including Algeria. Algeria has both cutaneous and visceral forms of leishmaniasis. The cutaneous form is caused by L. major and L. killicki (syn L. tropica), while the visceral form is caused by L. infantum. Treatment for leishmaniasis in Algeria includes antimony-containing compounds. However, there have been reports of treatment failures, leading to concerns about the emergence of chemoresistant strains. In order to better understand the situation, we determined the susceptibility of Leishmania isolates collected in Algeria to different forms of antimony. Our results show an increase in the frequency of resistant strains in cutaneous leishmaniasis over time, but not in visceral leishmaniasis. These findings highlight the need for more effective methods to monitor and prevent the spread of drug-resistant strains.
In the article, the authors describe a study they conducted on how exposure to certain types of bacteria can increase the risk of developing Crohn's disease. They found that acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella or Citrobacter rodentium can increase the risk of Crohn's disease, even long after the infection has cleared up. The authors found that this increased risk is associated with an increase in a specific type of bacteria called adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC). AIEC is a type of bacteria that is linked to Crohn's disease and can potentially worsen the disease. The authors used two different mouse models to study this relationship and found that the increased risk of Crohn's disease was associated with an increase in AIEC in the gut. They also found that blocking the growth of AIEC in the gut could ameliorate the risk of developing Crohn's disease. Overall, the authors found that AIEC is a disease modifier in response to acute gastroenteritis, and their findings have the potential to lead to new therapeutic interventions.
A recent study found that the lis-1 mutant female gametophyte produces defective pollen tubes and seeds. Further analysis revealed that the lis-1 mutant female gametophyte contains ectopic cells that adopt egg or central cell fate, instead of the accessory cells. These ectopic cells were found to express markers for egg, central, and antipodal cells, and could even form embryos or endosperm. The study suggests that a combinatorial mechanism is used to pattern the female gametophyte and to ensure that the key reproductive gametic cells are formed while preventing excess gametic cell formation.
Research has shown that wearing shoes can help prevent certain diseases, such as podoconiosis and snakebite. However, there is limited research on the role of footwear in preventing other diseases, such as hookworm and tungiasis. To better understand the factors that influence shoe-wearing behaviors, the authors conducted a qualitative study in a rural Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis. They found that going barefoot was becoming more socially unacceptable, and that shoes were seen as conferring dignity and protection against injury and cold. However, many practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice. These barriers included limited financial resources, the need to save shoes for special occasions, and difficulty finding shoes that fit properly. The authors suggest that some of the underlying structural level barriers related to poverty, such as price, quality, and suitability for daily activities, may be relevant to a range of neglected tropical diseases. They also identified several practical barriers that are amenable to intervention and may be of benefit to those considering NTD prevention through shoe distribution. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the social and behavioral factors that influence shoe-wearing behaviors in a rural Ethiopian community.
The pseudorabies virus (PRV) targets viral proteins to axons of infected neurons through its Us9 protein. However, it is unclear how Us9 promotes the sorting of so many viral proteins. In this report, we found that Us9 is associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected cells and that this association is critical to Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. We used infected non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, which are rat pheochromocytoma cells that acquire many characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). In these cells, Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) and reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. We conclude that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and, as a consequence, for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system.
This study is a great example of how scientific research can be presented in a lay summary that is easy to understand for a non-scientific audience. The summary provides an overview of the study and its main findings in clear and simple language, and it also includes a description of the research methods used. This summary is very helpful for readers who want to quickly get an understanding of what the study is about and how it was conducted.
Chikungunya virus, also known as CHIKV, is a type of virus that can cause severe fever in humans. In 2013, an outbreak of this virus occurred in the Americas. The virus had come from Asia, and scientists wanted to study its genetic diversity in infected individuals from the Caribbean to understand how it might have evolved during the ongoing outbreak. To do this, they used advanced sequencing technologies to analyze the diversity of the virus within infected individuals. They found a diverse range of minority variants present at different levels in the population, as well as changes in the overall genetic structure of the virus. They also discovered a new 3’ untranslated region (UTR) structure in the virus that may have contributed to its spread and adaptation. These findings highlight the need to continue studying the diversity of viruses like CHIKV over time to better understand how they evolve in new environments.
This study describes the role of a previously unknown gene called UBTOR in cell growth and the mTOR signaling pathway, which is involved in multiple human diseases. UBTOR is a vertebrate-specific gene that has not been well understood until now. The authors found that reducing UBTOR activity in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth. They also found that UBTOR depletion activates mTOR signaling and promotes cell growth, while UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. In addition, the authors found that UBTOR interacts with DEPTOR, a component of both mTOR complexes and an inhibitor of mTOR signaling, and stabilizes DEPTOR, which in turn regulates DEPTOR’s ubiquitination. Lastly, the study found that ubtor gene disruption in zebrafish increases mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS-induced neoplasia in the intact animals. In a xenograft-bearing mouse model, UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate how UBTOR regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling.
In this study, researchers set out to study the protein complexes and interactions of Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes the deadly disease African sleeping sickness in humans and Nagana in cattle. To do this, they used a combination of biochemical fractionation and mass spectrometry to identify proteins that were likely to be found together in the same complexes. The researchers were able to identify 128 high-confidence protein complexes that included 716 protein groups. These complexes were found to be similar in topology and biological characteristics to those found in model organisms. The researchers combined their protein complex map with other orthogonal resources of protein-protein interaction data to produce a high-confidence network. This network predicts the network context of 866 protein groups, including many hypothetical and experimentally unannotated proteins. The researchers then used this high-confidence network to identify novel factors involved in mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei. This study presents a valuable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins and provides potential functions for many previously uncharacterized proteins.
This article describes a study that looked at the impact of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection on lymph nodes in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques. Lymph nodes are a common site of extrapulmonary Mtb infection, but not much is known about how Mtb infection affects the structure and function of lymph nodes. To address this question, the authors analyzed thoracic lymph nodes from Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques using positron emission tomography (PET) scans, bacterial burden, lymph node structure, and immune function. They found that lymph nodes in Mtb-infected macaques become more active in terms of PET-measured metabolic activity. At necropsy, almost all of the FDG-avid lymph nodes contained viable Mtb or persistent Mtb DNA. The authors also found that Mtb grows to the same level in lymph nodes of both macaque species, but cynomolgus macaque lymph nodes were better able to control the infection compared to rhesus macaque lymph nodes. In comparison with granulomas in the lung, thoracic lymph nodes had limited abilities to kill Mtb. The authors also found that Mtb can destroy the lymph node structure, and that this destruction is associated with higher Mtb burden. Overall, the authors suggest that lymph nodes are an important site for Mtb persistence and may play a larger role in disease progression than previously appreciated.
In the last 150 years, scientists have studied microsporidia, which are fungus-like parasites that infect many types of animals. Recent research has revealed that microsporidia infect Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nematode that is commonly used as a research model. However, little is known about how widespread and diverse microsporidian infections are in C. elegans or other related nematodes in the wild. In this study, researchers isolated and cultured 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. They found that Nematocida parisii is the most common microsporidian infecting C. elegans in the wild. They also identified six new species of microsporidia in the Nematocida genus, two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, and named them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora. Interestingly, unlike Nematocida, these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. At the subcellular level in the infected host cell, spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane, instead of exocytosis as spores of Nematocida. The researchers also found that N. ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C. elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species, suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response. This study illustrates the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes and provides a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.
Chemokine receptors are a subtype of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that play important roles in the immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis as well as HIV-infection. Homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 have been reported to modulate receptor function. In this study, the homo- and heterodimerization patterns of these chemokine receptors were investigated at atomistic detail using thousands of molecular dynamics simulations. The results revealed that the closely related CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 share common features with regard to dimerization and interactions with cholesterol that differ from the previously reported characteristics of CXCR4. Furthermore, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 revealed an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs.
This article describes the symptoms and signs of three different forms of systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by a parasite that can affect the liver, spleen, and other organs. The first form is the classical form, which is characterized by prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting. The second form is a sub-clinical form, which can present with either one or two of these symptoms missing, and other findings such as lymphadenopathy and anemia. The third form, which is referred to as "atypical", is a recently discovered form that presents with symptoms that masquerade a non-functional immune system, which can result in recurrent secondary infections. This article also highlights the fact that systemic leishmaniasis presents with a much wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously thought, and is far more common than diagnosed to date.
The human genome has many mutations and polymorphisms that could potentially lead to diseases, drug reactions, infections, and age-related conditions. However, it is difficult to predict whether a particular mutation will lead to any of these outcomes. Computational approaches can help identify mutations that are more likely to have phenotypic consequences. One approach is to look at amino acid substitutions in conserved regions of human proteins, as these are less likely to be tolerated. However, there are limitations to this approach, as some mutations that destroy protein function may not be disease-causing. In addition, some redundant genes may have mutations that lead to disease without affecting their function. To address these limitations, researchers examined paralogous human genes. Paralogous genes are genes that have arisen by gene duplication and are part of a gene family. By comparing mutations in these genes, researchers were able to identify pairs of mutations that occur at homologous positions. They found that these mutations co-occur more frequently than expected, and that if one member of a mutation pair is disease-causing, the other is likely to be disease-causing as well. This information can be useful for identifying potentially disease-causing mutations and prioritizing mutations for further study.
In this study, researchers used RNA sequencing to analyze the expression of genes in parasites that cause severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients. The study found that parasites causing severe malaria had reduced glycolysis without compensatory pathways, altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation, and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. Additionally, the study identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease. These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria.
Scientists are working on delivering potent broadly-neutralizing antibodies to monkeys through an AAV vector to prevent HIV-1 infection. The antibodies delivered through the AAV vector were found to be safe and effective in reducing the viral load of the monkeys, even after repeated challenges with the difficult-to-neutralize virus. However, host antibody responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 out of 12 monkeys. The anti-antibody responses were found to limit the concentration of delivered antibody that could be achieved, which was reflected in the wide range of delivered antibody concentrations. The scientists discovered that the monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb completely resisted six successive SIVmac239 i.v. challenges. These results show the promise of the approach to prevent HIV-1 infection in people, but the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized.
Protein molecules often change shape when they bind to molecules such as ATP or when they are affected by heat or mechanical stress. Scientists have long thought that these changes in shape could be described by the idea of "normal modes" - a kind of mathematical representation of all the possible ways that the molecule can move. However, new research has found that the "normal mode" description does not hold true for certain important molecules, such as the proteins kinesin and myosin. This means that the way that these molecules move is actually much more complicated than scientists had thought. In particular, the study found that the movement of kinesin is so complicated that it cannot be described by any simple mathematical model. This suggests that there may be other ways to understand and study the behavior of these important molecules that are not currently known to scientists.
This research looks at how different pathways of endocytosis work together in cells. Endocytosis is the process by which cells take in substances from their environment. There are different types of endocytosis, and this research focuses on two of them: clathrin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin-independent endocytosis. These two pathways can work together, but the exact mechanisms of how they do this are not well understood. In this study, the researchers used different proteins that are important for endocytosis to see how they affect the different pathways. They found that some proteins that are important for clathrin-independent endocytosis can also affect clathrin-mediated endocytosis. They also found that some proteins that are important for one pathway can affect the other pathway in unexpected ways. This research provides new insights into how endocytosis works and how different pathways are connected.
The researchers found that there are many types of "Receiver" domains in bacteria, plants, and archaea that do not have the phosphorylation site that is usually important for signaling. These types of domains were called "Aspartate-Less Receiver" domains (ALR) because they are missing the phosphorylation site. The researchers also found that ALR domains are very common in bacteria and make up about 2% of all the Receiver domains in genomes. The ALR domains are also known to perform important functions in bacteria, such as controlling the production of proteins, DNA, and RNA. The researchers also studied the ALR domain found in Streptococcus pneumoniae and found that it may work differently than other Receiver domains. They found that this ALR domain does not need the phosphorylation site to work properly, and it may work by using a different type of signaling mechanism. This study provides new information about a type of Receiver domain that is important for signaling in bacteria and archaea, and it may help us understand how these organisms respond to changes in their environment.
Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (oHSVs) are viruses that attack and kill cancer cells. They are safe for people and effective in treating some types of cancer. In this study, the researchers made a new type of oHSV that was designed to specifically target cancer cells by using proteins that the cancer cells have on their surface. The new type of oHSV was also armed with a gene that makes the virus release a protein called interleukin 12 (IL-12). This protein helps the body's immune system fight the cancer. The researchers found that this new type of oHSV was very effective in treating cancer in mice. It was safe and caused a strong immune response that helped the mice fight the cancer. The IL-12-armed version of the virus was more effective than the unarmed one. This new type of oHSV is now ready to be tested in people.
Scientists have been working on creating a vaccine to prevent HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) for a long time. In the past, they have used different viruses to create a vaccine, such as adenovirus and canarypox virus. However, some concerns have been raised about the safety of these vaccines, and it is important to understand why these vaccines might not be safe. Researchers have found that the CD4 T cells created by these vaccines are more susceptible to HIV infection. They have also found that these CD4 T cells have different properties depending on which virus was used to create them. This research is important because it can help scientists create a safer vaccine for HIV in the future.
X inactivation refers to the phenomenon in which females silence one of their two X chromosomes in each cell. While X inactivation is universal in therian mammals, the strategy used to choose which X to silence varies greatly among species. In marsupials, females always silence the paternally inherited X, while in placental mammals, the process is random. However, recent studies suggest that in some placental mammal species, this process is biased, resulting in different rates of inactivation of maternally versus paternally inherited X chromosomes. It is currently unclear what selective pressures might account for this observed diversity in X inactivation strategies. This paper presents a theoretical population genetic analysis of X inactivation evolution and suggests that a single critical interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a wide range of X inactivation strategies, including biased inactivation patterns. Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness. These results provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and lead to several useful predictions that could motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation.
ZAP (Zinc-finger CCCH-type containing antiviral protein) is a protein found in humans and animals that helps fight off viruses. It has been shown to be effective against many viruses, but not all. In this study, we examined the antiviral activity of ZAP against three different flaviviruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). We found that ZAP blocked JEV infection, but not DENV or ZIKV. We also found that JEV infection was hindered by ZAP through translation inhibition and RNA degradation. The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were required for this activity, and we found that JEV had specific RNA regions that bound ZAP and made it more sensitive to ZAP's activity. In summary, we identified JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus, and ZAP may be an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection.
The article discusses the symptoms and pathogenesis of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a disease that can affect humans and livestock. The authors compared the host response to infection with wild-type or vaccine strains of RVFV in a mouse model and found that the immune response was stronger in mice infected with the wild-type virus, which correlated with severe disease outcomes and high virus titers. The authors also identified specific cytokines and chemokines that were produced in response to infection with RVFV and found that the levels of these molecules were higher in mice infected with the wild-type virus. Additionally, the authors found that the vaccine strain of RVFV caused a stronger immune response in the brain than the wild-type virus. These findings suggest that the host response to RVFV infection plays a significant role in the development of disease outcomes and that future research into immune responses to RVFV may lead to the development of new treatments or vaccines.
This study focuses on chemotherapy resistance in breast cancer, specifically triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The authors found that C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) is significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response (pCR). They also found that CCL20 promotes the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), leading to increased chemoresistance and a worse prognosis. In addition, the study found that CCL20-promoted NF-κB activation increases ABCB1 expression, leading to increased taxane resistance. These findings suggest that CCL20 can be a predictive marker for taxane response and that blocking CCL20 or its downstream pathway might reverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients.
Toxoplasma is a parasite that infects most warm-blooded animals and can cause serious health problems in humans. It replicates in a cellular structure called the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and secretes effector proteins that help it control the host cell's behavior. To find out how these effector proteins are transported into the host cell, we screened a library of mutant parasites for those that were unable to transport the effectors GRA16 and GRA24 into the host cell. We found two new proteins, MYR2 and MYR3, that are required for this process. These proteins are located in the PV and form a complex with MYR1, which we identified previously. We also showed that fusing GRA16 to a protein called murine dihydrofolate reductase (mDHFR) blocks its translocation into the host cell nucleus. This suggests that effector proteins may need to be unfolded before they can be transported through the PVM. Overall, our findings reveal a new complex of proteins that are necessary for effector proteins to be transported into the host cell.
The origin recognition complex (ORC) is a group of proteins that helps start the process of making a copy of DNA before cell division. A group of researchers found that two different types of papillomavirus (HPV and BPV-1) proteins, E2, bind to one part of the ORC, the ORC2. However, this binding does not occur at the part of the DNA that the virus uses to make copies of itself. The researchers also found that when they removed the ORC2, the virus made more copies of itself. They also found that when the virus made more of the E2 protein, it bound less to the ORC2, which caused it to make more copies of itself. They think that the virus uses the ORC2 to stop itself from making copies of itself too early or too often. This helps the virus to spread more efficiently over time.
A study was conducted in Dushanbe, Tajikistan to investigate the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk using qPCR. 10.3% of 564 milk samples were found positive for Brucella DNA. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene showed that one cow was infected with B . abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B . melitensis . The qPCR results did not match the serology results. The study highlights the need for further investigation to develop complementary diagnostic strategies and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella species circulating among livestock in this region.
This paper focuses on the relationship between chromosome and genome stability and accessory chromosomes. Accessory chromosomes are chromosomes that do not have a standard structure, and they are often highly unstable. The authors of this paper want to understand how two different types of histone methylation marks affect the stability of accessory chromosomes. They do this by deleting genes that encode enzymes that add these methylation marks, creating a double mutant. They then use whole genome sequencing, ChIP sequencing, and RNA sequencing to compare the differences in genome and chromatin structure, and gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains. Their results show that H3K9me3 prevents H3K27me3 in regions that are important for maintaining genome stability. In contrast, H3K27me3 actually increases the stability of accessory chromosomes. They also find that loss of H3K9me3 promotes chromosome breakage and the formation of new chromosomes, while loss of H3K27me3 enhances chromosome loss and instability. The authors conclude that both types of histone methylation marks are important for maintaining genome stability, but they have opposite effects on accessory chromosomes.
Rabies is a deadly disease that can be prevented with prompt and appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). However, life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals are often inaccessible or unaffordable, especially to the poorest sectors of society who are most at risk and bear the largest burden of rabies. To address this issue, we analyzed different PEP vaccination regimens and their relative costs and benefits. We found that switching from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration of PEP can significantly reduce the volume of vaccine needed to treat the same number of patients. This can help mitigate vaccine shortages and dramatically reduce costs for both patients and healthcare providers. We present financing mechanisms that can make PEP more affordable and accessible for bite victims, subsidize costs for those most in need, and support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs. We conclude that a universal switch to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths and being economical for healthcare providers.
The study investigated how the parasite Toxoplasma gondii uses host lipid droplets (LD) during its life cycle. Toxoplasma is an intracellular parasite that infects mammalian cells and resides in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV). The study found that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in cells that are depleted of LD or impaired in TAG lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. The PV is surrounded by host LD, and the parasite can access lipids stored in host LD and incorporates these lipids into its own membranes and LD. Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes within the PV host LD, some of which remain associated with Rab7. The parasite forms an intravacuolar network of membranes (IVN) to process host LD and release lipid content. The study highlights the reliance of Toxoplasma on host LD for its intracellular development and its capability of scavenging neutral lipids from host LD.
Scientists have found that a type of medicine called chalcones, which come from a kind of plant called flavonoids, are effective at killing a type of liver fluke called Fasciola hepatica. This is a parasite that lives in the bile ducts of humans and animals and causes an infection called fasciolosis. The scientists found that chalcones are effective at killing the immature form of the parasite, called juvenile, and that they also kill the mature form, called adult. This means that chalcones could be used to treat infections caused by Fasciola hepatica and other types of liver flukes.
The visual system of animals transmits information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways. We used in vivo imaging to investigate how bipolar cells, the neurons that transmit this information to the inner retina, do this. We found that the size of the synaptic terminal, the structure where the bipolar cell makes its connection to other neurons, contributes to how it transmits visual signals. Smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release, with higher initial gain, followed by more profound adaptation. They also transmit high frequencies more effectively. These differences in the outputs of small and large terminals are also observed in individual cells, which can therefore transmit visual information through channels with different gains, temporal filters and adaptive properties.
This study presents a novel image analysis method to detect and measure individual synapses at the single-synapse level. The proposed method, based on machine learning algorithms, uses multiplex fluorescence microscopy (muxFM) data to analyze the structural and molecular diversity of synapses. The method produces a probability map of synaptic voxels, allowing for flexible and intuitive analysis of synapse populations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by applying it to images from conjugate array tomography (cAT), a technique that combines fluorescence and electron microscopy imaging. They show that the algorithm can accurately detect synapses and reproduce known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. The study suggests that the proposed method could be useful for analyzing widely available confocal and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy images.
Zinc is an important element that is essential for the proper functioning of many proteins in the body. Mammalian zinc transport takes place through two families of transporters, ZnT and ZIP, with ZnT2 responsible for zinc accumulation and secretion into breast milk during lactation. The mechanism of ZnT2 function is currently unknown, but recent studies suggest that it may be a proton-coupled zinc transporter, meaning that it transports zinc and protons together. This function is important for maintaining proper zinc levels in the body, and is especially important during lactation for breastfed infants. Further research is needed to better understand the function of ZnT2 and its potential therapeutic implications.
In this study, the authors identify novel interaction partners of the human DNA repair nuclease Exo1. They used a yeast two-hybrid system and show that Exo1 interacts with three different isoforms of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. The authors also show that 14-3-3 proteins regulate Exo1 activity and phosphorylation in response to DNA replication stress. Furthermore, they found that 14-3-3 proteins play a role in the regulation of replication fork progression and stability. Overall, the authors provide evidence for a previously unknown role of 14-3-3 proteins in DNA repair.
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are immune cells that are believed to play a role in immune responses to viruses. However, their exact role in HIV infection and immunopathogenesis is still unclear. The authors used humanized mouse models to investigate the effects of pDCs on HIV infection and immunopathogenesis. They developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes pDCs in all lymphoid organs in the mouse. They found that when pDCs were depleted prior to HIV infection, there was a decrease in interferon production, and an increase in HIV replication. During chronic infection, depletion of pDCs also led to a decrease in interferon production and an increase in HIV replication. Surprisingly, depletion of pDCs did not lead to an increase in CD4 T cell death. The authors conclude that pDCs play a complex role in HIV infection and immunopathogenesis, with opposing effects on suppressing and promoting immune responses to HIV.
A recent study found that sulforaphane (SFN), a chemical found in cruciferous vegetables, can block infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in primary macrophages, but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. SFN appears to block HIV infection by acting on the transcription factor nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which helps cells protect themselves from damage. This is a new way to potentially block HIV infection that could be explored further for future therapies.
Pregnant women in rural western Kenya are commonly infected with parasites that cause geohelminths. These parasites are common worldwide and can cause health problems. However, it is not clear what risk factors contribute to geohelminth infections among pregnant women and what effects these infections have on their health. During a community-based study, pregnant women were asked to provide blood and stool samples. The study found that 76.2% of pregnant women were infected with at least one type of geohelminth. Ascaris lumbricoides was the most common type of infection, followed by hookworm and Trichuris trichiura. Using interviews and medical examinations, the study looked for associations between geohelminth infections and other health factors, including symptoms, anemia, and nutritional status. The study found that hookworm infections were associated with a lower mid upper arm circumference, which is a sign of malnutrition. Women with hookworm infections with an egg count of 1000/gram of feces were also found to have lower hemoglobin levels. However, the study found no evidence of serious health effects among pregnant women with geohelminth infections. Routine treatment for geohelminth infections during pregnancy is recommended, but more research is needed to understand the potential benefits of this treatment.
Mycolactone is a chemical made by a type of bacteria that causes skin ulcers. It can also cause pain in humans and animals. This study found that mycolactone can prevent nerve cells from making certain chemicals that are important for causing pain. The study also found that mycolactone can prevent nerve cells from getting hurt. The study used different types of nerve cells that are important for pain, including those found in the brain and spinal cord, as well as nerve cells found in the skin. The study also looked at the effects of mycolactone in a mouse model of nerve damage. The study found that mycolactone can prevent nerve damage from causing inflammation and pain. This study helps to explain how mycolactone might work as an analgesic (a medicine that reduces pain) and how it might be useful for treating pain caused by nerve damage.
Scientists wanted to know if genes that make up our immune system play a role in how our bodies react to a parasite that causes sleeping sickness. They studied this parasite in people in Guinea who had different symptoms or did not have symptoms at all. They found that certain genes were linked to specific outcomes of the disease. For example, having a certain version of a gene called IL6 was linked to a lower risk of developing full-blown disease. Other genes were linked to increased risk or no symptoms at all. These findings could help scientists better understand how to treat or prevent the disease.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for more comprehensive cataloging of different classes of genetic variants with a single assay: from changes that affect only a single base in the genome (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) to small size additions and omissions (insertion-deletions, indels) and larger contiguous changes in the genome (structural variants, SVs). A recent study by the Singapore Sequencing Malay Project (SSMP) found that deep sequencing was more effective than sequencing multiple individuals at a lower depth for more complete characterization of variants carried by individuals.
The paper describes the mechanisms behind the resistance of Burkholderia pseudomallei, a disease-causing bacterium, to aminoglycoside and macrolide antibiotics. The paper reports that the resistance of some strains of B. pseudomallei is due to the absence or reduced expression of the amrAB-oprA efflux pump, which removes these antibiotics from the cell. The paper also describes a mutant strain with a large chromosomal deletion that removed several putative virulence genes, and yet was still fully virulent in a mouse model. The paper suggests that B. pseudomallei may be a good candidate for genetic manipulation experiments. The paper is of interest to researchers, medical professionals, and others interested in understanding the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in B. pseudomallei.
T helper (Th) cells are immune cells that help defend against invading microorganisms and cancers. There are two types of Th cells, Th1 and Th2, which specialize in fighting different types of infections. The differentiation of Th cells into these two types is controlled by specific transcription factors that are activated by cytokines, which are proteins that signal through cell surface receptors. In this study, researchers used single-cell analysis to explore the early differentiation of Th cells into Th1 or Th2. They observed that while these transcription factors are thought to be expressed exclusively in the corresponding Th1 or Th2 cells, they were actually expressed in many cells at the same time. This led the researchers to propose that during the early differentiation process, Th cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state and that this mixed state is instructed by extracellular cytokines. This study provides new insights into the differentiation of Th cells and may help in developing new strategies to target Th cell-related diseases.
C. elegans PAQR-2 is a type of receptor that helps the worm adapt to cold temperatures. We used genetic screening to find genes that help this receptor work better in cold conditions. We found 9 genes that help the receptor function better in cold temperatures. These genes help the worm make a type of fat called phosphatidylcholine (PC) and change the type of fat the worm makes to help keep its membranes fluid in cold temperatures. This is an important discovery because it helps us understand how worms adapt to cold temperatures.
Herpesviruses are widespread and well-known human pathogens that cause a range of diseases including cold sores, chicken pox, blindness, congenital defects, and cancer. HSV-1 is a type of herpesvirus with a 200 MDa T=16 icosahedral capsid containing the viral DNA genome, surrounded by a pleomorphic tegument layer and a glycoprotein-containing lipid envelope. The diameter of the capsid is constant at 1250 Å and the virion size varies between 1550-2400 Å. The main features of the capsid are pentons, hexons, and triplexes. The twelfth vertex of the capsid is occupied by a portal that forms the route for DNA packaging and release. Techniques for determining the structures of icosahedral viruses have contributed greatly to our understanding of virus biology. Recent cryo-EM and cryo-ET methods have allowed non-icosahedral features in virus particles to be visualized in detail. Evolutionary and structural links between tailed bacteriophages and herpesviruses suggest that similar machinery may be present in herpesvirus particles. However, lack of evidence for a specialized tail-like structure in herpes virions appeared to indicate that such a structure was unnecessary. Nevertheless, the delivery of DNA into nuclei by herpesviruses is analogous to the delivery of DNA into bacterial cells by tailed bacteriophages. Some actions performed by the tail, such as penetrating the bacterial cell wall, are not germane to herpesviruses but others such as receptor recognition, capsid orientation and signaling may be required to ensure that the herpesvirus capsid docks and releases its genome at the nuclear pore complex. In this paper, a previously unrecognized feature within the tegument of HSV-1 virions is described. By analogy with tailed bacteriophages, this feature may mediate interactions between the portal vertex and cellular components at key points in the viral life cycle.
The study investigated how a protein called "omega-1" from a parasite called Schistosoma mansoni affects HIV-1 infection in vitro. Omega-1 is known to modulate the immune response and cause a shift towards a Th2 phenotype. The study found that omega-1 can inhibit HIV-1 infection by blocking the trans-infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes. It also found that omega-1 can reduce the capacity of CD4+ T-lymphocytes to produce IFN-γ and MIP-1β. The study suggests that omega-1 can potentially influence disease course in co-infected individuals.
We understand that you would like us to summarize the content of the provided abstract. Here is our attempt at a lay summary of the provided content:  The authors present a mathematical model to explain the phenomenon of ECS shrinkage in neurons and surrounding astrocytes in response to neuronal stimulation. They find that the shrinkage is due to a combination of neuronal release of potassium, uptake of sodium, potassium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane. The authors also note that the actions of the NKCC1 and NBC cotransporters are critical determinants of the observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. They argue that their model framework can guide future experiments and help pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models. The authors hope that their work will help us understand the normal behavioral repertoire of astrocytes and their potential role in treating a range of neurological and psychiatric disorders.
This study explores how chromatin modifying enzymes are recruited to transcriptionally silent regions of the genome. In Arabidopsis, these enzymes are recruited by a complex process involving RNA polymerase V, AGO4, and a protein called SPT5L. The authors show that SPT5L binds to chromatin independently of AGO4 and 24-nt siRNA, but in parallel with AGO4. They also show that both AGO4 and SPT5L are required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications at certain loci. The authors propose that the coordinate binding of SPT5L and AGO4 creates a platform for direct or indirect recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes.
Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by ticks to humans and animals. RpoS is a protein that helps bacteria adapt to different environments, and it has been studied extensively in the mammalian host of B. burgdorferi. However, its role in the tick phase of the enzootic cycle, which is the part of the life cycle when B. burgdorferi is transmitted to humans or animals, has not been examined. In this study, we found that RpoS-dependent gene expression is important for the transmission of spirochetes from the tick to the mammalian host. We also discovered that spirochetes form a different morphology, called round bodies, when they are not able to produce enough energy for transmission. Round body formation is quickly reversible and may be caused by a decrease in the levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, which provides NAD+ for glycolysis. Our findings reveal a new role for RpoS in the tick phase of the enzootic cycle, as well as a potential default survival mode for spirochetes that cannot produce enough energy for transmission.
This study aimed to understand how two hormones, gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA), work together to control the development of stamen in Arabidopsis. The authors found that GA-dependent genes, MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, are expressed in stamen and play a crucial role in stamen development. The authors also showed that the loss of function of four DELLA proteins that are repressors of GA response leads to a short stamen phenotype, but the loss of function of these four DELLA proteins could not suppress the short stamen phenotype caused by the loss of function of MYB21 and MYB24. In addition, the authors found that JA biosynthesis genes, DAD1 and LOX1, are upregulated by GA, which in turn leads to increased JA production. Finally, the authors showed that the GA-deficient quadruple mutant, which lacks four DELLA proteins and has a short stamen phenotype, has lower JA content than the wild type. Based on these findings, the authors concluded that GA upregulates DAD1 and LOX1 to promote JA production and, in turn, promotes stamen development.
This study investigates how a protein called HIF-1 affects the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) worms. The authors found that worms with reduced levels of HIF-1 lived longer than normal worms. This effect was due to the fact that HIF-1 is regulated by a protein called the TOR pathway, which is involved in nutrient sensing and metabolism. The authors also found that HIF-1 was involved in a process called ER stress, which is related to the IRE-1 pathway and is important for regulating cellular processes. Overall, the study suggests that HIF-1 plays an important role in regulating lifespan and metabolism in C. elegans worms.
In this study, the authors investigated the unique chromatin changes that occur when human keratinocytes differentiate or migrate. They found that these two states had distinct enhancers and super-enhancers, which are regions of the genome that regulate gene expression. The authors also identified the transcription factor GRHL3 as one of the main factors regulating these states. They found that GRHL3 binds to super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes and to promoters in migrating keratinocytes. They also found that GRHL3 regulates the formation of super-enhancers in each of these states. The study suggests that chromatin changes play a key role in regulating the differentiation and migration of keratinocytes.
Retroviruses are infectious particles that can integrate their genetic material into host DNA. These viruses can infect the germ cells of their hosts, resulting in stable endogenous copies that are passed down through generations. Over time, many of these ERVs become inactive. However, some ERVs may have beneficial effects on their hosts, such as helping to fight off other retroviruses. Sheep are a good model for studying the coevolution of ERVs and their hosts because they are infected with two oncogenic exogenous retroviruses that are closely related to endogenous retroviruses in their genome. In this study, the authors found that a transdominant endogenous retrovirus had emerged in sheep within the last 200 years. This suggests that endogenization and selection of ERVs acting as restriction factors is a mechanism used by the host to fight against retroviruses.
This study evaluated two Schistosoma PCRs to diagnose active schistosomiasis infections and to monitor treatment efficacy. Schistosoma PCRs were performed on 412 samples, including urine, stool, biopsies, and serum from patients with suspected schistosomiasis. The results showed that PCR significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis compared to microscopy. The overall sensitivity of PCR on serum samples was 72.7% and reached 94.1% in patients with positive excreta. The specificity of serum PCR was 98.9%. After treatment, serum PCR positivity rates slowly declined from 93.8% at day 30 to 8.3% at day 360, while antibody detection remained positive after 1 year. This study demonstrated that Schistosoma PCRs clearly outperform standard microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of reference methods combined with WB-based serology, which remains a gold standard for initial diagnosis. When serological assays are positive and microscopy is negative, serum PCRs provide species information to guide further clinical exploration. Biomarkers such as DNA and antibodies are of limited relevance for early treatment monitoring, but serum PCR could be useful when performed at least 1 year after treatment to help confirm a cured infection.
Machine learning has been used to estimate the potential energy surface of Archazolid A, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase. The model used Gaussian process regression to estimate energies of new conformations by exploiting information from previous calculations. The study demonstrates that predictive machine learning models can be developed for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, potentially enabling considerable speed-ups in simulations of larger molecular structures.
This study developed a new way to detect antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) in the feces of great apes. This method is useful because it allows researchers to determine if apes have been exposed to EBOV without having to take blood samples, which is a difficult and invasive procedure. Using this method, the researchers found that gorillas have antibodies to EBOV in their feces, indicating that they have been exposed to the virus. The prevalence of EBOV antibodies in gorillas was about 10% on average. This suggests that not all gorillas die after being exposed to EBOV. The researchers also found evidence of antibodies in gorillas that had been previously thought to be unexposed to EBOV. This means that gorillas may be protected from EBOV by barriers like rivers, which can prevent the spread of the virus. This new method will help researchers keep track of EBOV outbreaks in gorillas, and it could be used to help protect apes from future outbreaks. The researchers hope that this new method will help protect gorillas and other great apes from EBOV, and it could also help protect humans from the spread of EBOV from apes.
This paper describes a new type of bacteria-delivered protein, called XopL, that is released into plant cells by a special system called the type III secretion system. XopL has the ability to add a chemical called "ubiquitin" to other proteins in the plant cell. This process, called "ubiquitination," is important for many cellular functions, including the regulation of gene expression and protein activity. The authors suggest that XopL may be used by bacteria to manipulate the plant's immune response. They found that the part of XopL that is responsible for adding ubiquitin to other proteins is located in a special region of the protein called the "XL-box." The authors also found that mutations to the XL-box region of XopL can stop it from being able to add ubiquitin to other proteins. They then used these mutations to test whether XopL is needed to trigger the plant's immune response. The authors conclude that XopL has a unique structure and that it is an example of how bacteria can mimic the activity of proteins that are important for eukaryotes (organisms whose cells have a defined nucleus) such as humans.
This study aimed to understand the immune response of HIV-infected individuals in different stages of infection and the impact of early antiretroviral treatment on immune function. To do this, the authors studied T follicular helper cells (Tfh) and memory B cells from HIV-infected individuals during the early and late acute stages of infection, and compared their function and phenotype before and after ART. The authors found that cTfh-mediated B cell responses were impaired in individuals treated in the late acute stage compared to those treated in the early acute stage. The authors also found that there were phenotypic perturbations in the memory B cell compartment, including a decrease in resting memory B cells in late acute individuals compared to early acute individuals. The authors concluded that early ART for acutely HIV-infected individuals could help preserve immune function, including Tfh function and memory B cells.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection affecting over 200 million people worldwide. Treatment for this disease relies on a single drug, praziquantel, which has several non-optimal features. To develop next generation anthelmintics, researchers need to identify and characterize new drug targets, but this process can be challenging. In this study, researchers pharmacologically profiled a schistosome serotonergic G protein coupled receptor ( Sm . 5HTR ) that has been implicated as a downstream modulator of PZQ efficacy. The researchers used a miniaturized screening assay that employs a split luciferase based biosensor sensitive to cellular cAMP levels, which allows them to resolve the proximal kinetics of GPCR modulation in intact cells. They found that Sm . 5HTR has a divergent pharmacological signature from the closest human GPCR homolog ( Hs . 5HTR7 ), suggesting that the receptor is a promising target for developing next generation anthelmintics. The researchers identified new ligands and compound series with potency and selectivity for Sm . 5HTR over Hs . 5HTR7, and validated them for in vivo efficacy against schistosomules and adult worms. Finally, the researchers discovered an unusual antagonist-evoked inactivation mechanism for Sm . 5HTR that enhances the attractiveness of the receptor as a drug target.
Researchers have found that the separation of germ layers during the development of a frog embryo is not just due to a difference in adhesion between cells. Instead, a special region called Brachet's cleft, which is the boundary between the ectoderm and mesoderm germ layers, allows the mesoderm to move across it while preventing it from invading the ectoderm. This is made possible through a process called ephrin/Eph signaling, where cells alternate between adhesion and detachment, and detachment requires ephrinB/EphB signaling. Multiple ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors are expressed on each side of the boundary, and tissue separation depends on forward signaling across the boundary in both directions, involving partially redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and RhoA. This mechanism differs from a simple differential adhesion process of germ layer formation. Instead, it involves localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle which allows for cell migration across a cellular substratum.
The paper aims to analyze metabolite concentrations of the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transulfuration pathways to provide a stronger foundation for diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ). The study used a cross-validatory approach to compare 83 participants with ASD and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers. Fisher Discriminant Analysis enabled multivariate classification of participants as on the spectrum or neurotypical, resulting in 96.1% of all neurotypical participants being correctly identified and 97.6% of the ASD cohort. The paper also used kernel partial least squares to predict adaptive behavior, measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite score, with an R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation. These results indicate a strong association between the metabolites under consideration and ASD diagnosis, as well as predicting adaptive behavior scores. The study provides the strongest evidence to date of the association between FOCM/TS dysfunction and ASD.
Leishmaniasis is a group of diseases that are caused by parasites and transmitted by sandflies. The parasites affect different parts of the human body and can be fatal if not treated in the early stages. Leishmaniasis is endemic in many countries, including Brazil, where it causes a large number of cases every year. In this study, we analyzed the incidence data of two types of leishmaniasis in Brazil over a 10-year period. We used Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models to predict the number of cases and identify the risk factors for each type of leishmaniasis. The predicted number of cases for visceral leishmaniasis was highest in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará, while the predicted number of cases for cutaneous leishmaniasis was highest in the state of Pará. We identified precipitation and socioeconomic proxies as important risk factors for both types of leishmaniasis. Our study provides high-resolution maps of leishmaniasis incidence in Brazil that can be used to prioritize intervention areas and optimize resource allocation for disease control and elimination efforts.
Dengue fever is a rapidly spreading virus that affects millions of people around the world every year. Children are known to be at higher risk of developing complications such as internal bleeding and shock, but as the virus spreads to new areas, more adults are also developing serious complications. A recent study looked at the clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of dengue fever in both adults and children in southern Vietnam. The study found that adults had more severe internal bleeding and organ damage, while children had more signs of vascular leakage and shock. Knowing these differences is important to develop appropriate management strategies for different age groups.
This study examined the ability of a virus called SIV to cause disease in different types of animals. The study found that while the virus causes a severe form of AIDS in humans, it does not cause disease in two natural hosts, sooty mangabeys (SM) and chimpanzees. Scientists found that the reason for this difference is that SM express a defective version of a molecule called CCR5 on the surface of their cells. This molecule is used by SIV to infect cells, so a defective version does not allow the virus to enter the cells. However, despite the lack of a functional version of CCR5, SIV is still able to infect and replicate in SM cells, using other molecules on the cell surface. This finding is important because it shows that SIV can use different entry pathways depending on the cells it infects. This study suggests that SIV may not be as dependent on a single entry pathway as previously thought, which may help explain why the virus is able to persist in some animals without causing disease.
MEF2 (a family of transcription factors) plays both pro-oncogenic and tumor-suppressive roles in cancer. The study shows that the behavior of MEF2 is dependent on the interaction with co-activators or co-repressors. The study used leiomyosarcoma (LMS) as a model to show how MEF2 is involved in the process of cancer. The study found that HDAC9, a type of class IIa HDAC, is overexpressed in 22% of LMS and that high levels of MEF2, HDAC4, and HDAC9 correlate with poor overall survival. The study also showed that knocking out HDAC9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of LMS cells. The study suggests that HDAC9 may be a target for therapeutic intervention in LMS.
Hydrophobins are proteins produced by fungi that affect their environment to promote growth and have numerous applications in nanotechnology. They assemble into films at interfaces, such as the air-water interface, which have unique properties. In this study, the authors used protein-protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and electron cryo-microscopy to study two types of hydrophobin films, HFBI and HFBII, produced by Trichoderma reesei. The results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins, with P6 symmetry. However, the experimental results show P3 symmetry with a unit cell size of 56 Å. The authors found a possible metastable structure with P3 symmetry and a smaller lattice size. They also used a Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate the role this alternate possible ordering could have in the formation of the surface structure.
This study is about a protein called Threonyl tRNA synthetase (LdThrRS) in a parasite called Leishmania donovani. ThrRS is a central enzyme required for protein synthesis and is targeted by drugs in bacteria and fungi. In this study, the researchers expressed and purified LdThrRS in E. coli and determined its kinetic parameters. They also determined the subcellular localization of LdThrRS by immunofluorescence analysis. The researchers also created mutant parasites with genetic manipulations and examined their growth, virulence, aminoacylation activity and sensitivity to a drug called borrelidin. They found that borrelidin had a strong affinity for LdThrRS and inhibited its aminoacylation activity. They also found that borrelidin had antileishmanial activity in the promastigote stage of parasites and that the genetically modified parasites were more susceptible to borrelidin. Overall, the study suggests that LdThrRS is essential for the survival of L. donovani and that it is a potential target for drug discovery efforts.
The immune system recognizes pathogens by detecting their specific molecules. This recognition is done by a group of proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). These receptors recognize specific molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are unique to pathogens. This process is important for the immune system to differentiate between self and non-self molecules. For example, RIG-I is a PRR that recognizes viral RNA by detecting a specific sequence motif called the 5′-triphosphate (5′-ppp). This process is important for the immune system to recognize viral RNA as non-self and trigger an immune response against it. In this study, the authors analyzed the RNA structure-function attributes that impart the PAMP function of the poly-U/UC tract in HCV RNA. They found that the 34 nucleotide poly-uridine “core” of this sequence tract was essential for RIG-I activation. They also found that interspersed ribocytosine nucleotides between poly-U sequences in the RNA were required to achieve optimal RIG-I signal induction. Finally, they showed that HCV poly-U/UC RNA variants that strongly activated RIG-I signaling triggered potent anti-HCV responses in vitro and hepatic innate immune responses in vivo using a mouse model of PAMP signaling. These findings define a multi-motif PAMP signature of non-self recognition by RIG-I that incorporates a 5′-ppp with poly-uridine sequence composition and length. This HCV PAMP motif drives potent RIG-I signaling to induce the innate immune response to infection. In summary, the authors found that the poly-U/UC tract in HCV RNA is recognized as non-self by RIG-I through the presence of a 5′-ppp with poly-uridine sequence composition and length. This recognition triggers an innate immune response to HCV infection.
The study investigated the role of eosinophils in the growth of Trichinella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle. The study found that eosinophils from IL-4 competent mice are sufficient to support growth of the larvae, and that eosinophil-mediated effects on larval growth are independent of adaptive immunity. The study also showed that eosinophils promote larval growth by an IL-4-dependent mechanism that limits local interferon-driven responses. These findings provide evidence for a host-parasite relationship in which the recruitment of eosinophils promotes a nutrient-rich environment that facilitates larval growth.
Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide replication kinetics in human and mouse embryonic stem cells. We analyze DNA replication timing profiles from massive sequencing of newly replicated DNA, and replication origin maps generated by a novel chromatin immunoprecipitation-based method. We find that most replication origins are activated synchronously in early S phase, but activation is delayed and less efficient in late replicating domains. We find that replication forks move faster than the mean apparent replication speed of single forks, and that the mean apparent replication speed varies between cell lines, likely due to changes in chromatin structure. These findings are compatible with a model of origin activation in which origins are activated in a wave-like fashion, with the replication fork stimulating activation of neighboring origins. We also find that replication origins are embedded in regions of open chromatin and are correlated with the timing of origin activation. Our analysis of DNA combing data reveals that the replication fork velocity varies in different regions of the genome, and that a large fraction of replication forks replicate at speeds faster than the mean velocity of single forks, including in regions of the genome that are thought to replicate by a single fork. This suggests that origins are often activated sequentially in regions of the genome that replicate by a single fork, and that the mean velocity of the replication fork is not a good estimate of the velocity of the earliest fork in the region. These results provide evidence that replication initiation is not a stochastic process but is regulated by chromatin structure, and that replication forks stimulate origin activation in adjacent domains.
The nervous system is very good at recognizing objects, even when the context in which they are seen changes. This is because we mostly see objects from slightly different angles or under different lighting conditions. The ability to recognize objects is learned from experience, not innate. The slowness principle is a way of learning to recognize objects by focusing on features that change slowly over time. The principle is based on the idea that it is likely that an object seen at one moment will be present again at the next moment. Therefore, the goal of the slowness principle is to learn about features of the input that change slowly. To do this, the brain needs to adapt to the sensory input in order to extract slowly varying aspects, thus creating a representation of an object that is not strongly affected by irrelevant changes in the sensory input. The slowness principle is used in a type of learning called slow feature analysis. This technique finds the function that changes the slowest over time in the input signal. To do this, it uses the variance of the time derivative of the signal as the objective function. In this paper, we show that the slowness principle can be implemented in a model of a spiking neuron using a modified version of Hebb's learning rule. We also show that the same principle can be implemented in a spiking neuron using spike-timing–dependent plasticity. The two methods are equivalent in terms of their ability to implement the slowness principle, but spike-timing–dependent plasticity is more biologically realistic.
This study explores how tumor cells interact with each other to resist cancer treatment. The authors found that cancer cells exposed to treatment can induce resistance in nearby cells by sharing resistance traits. This behavior, termed "cooperative adaptation to therapy," is not well understood, and this study provides new insights into this process. The authors used a three-dimensional in vitro culture platform to study this phenomenon and found that drug-induced cell state transitions play a key role. They also developed a mathematical model to simulate how this cooperative behavior affects population growth over time. These findings may help us better understand how tumors develop resistance to treatment and inform the development of new therapies.
The paper is about a study on rickettsioses, a group of bacterial infections that can cause fever and other symptoms, in the Mbeya region of Tanzania. The authors randomly selected 1,228 people from nine communities in this region to test for antibodies against rickettsiae using a dilution of 1:64. They found that 67.9% of the people were seropositive for rickettsiae. The authors then analyzed the data to identify potential risk factors for rickettsioses, such as age, temperature, population density, and livestock density. They used regression analysis to determine the association between these factors and seropositivity. The authors concluded that rickettsioses are common in the Mbeya region of Tanzania and that spread of the infection is limited by temperature and elevation. They suggested that a prospective study of rickettsioses should be conducted to estimate the disease burden in the population.
Fatty acids have many important roles in the body, including making up the building blocks of cells and energy storage. They can also act as signals for cellular communication and affect cell membrane fluidity. In this study, researchers found that a specific type of fatty acid called oleate is important for immune defense in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that the production of oleate is needed for the body's immune response to be activated when it is infected by bacteria. The researchers found that worms that cannot make oleate are more likely to be killed by the bacteria. They also found that adding oleate to the worms' environment can help protect them from the bacteria. This study suggests that oleate has an important role in the body's defense against infections.
Researchers have found that certain compounds that bind to a type of genetic element called a riboswitch can kill bacteria. These riboswitches are involved in the regulation of the production of certain chemicals that are important for the cell's "nucleotide pool." When these compounds, called PC1, bind to the riboswitch, they cause the bacteria to stop making these chemicals and ultimately die. This effect is only seen when the bacteria are not starved for these chemicals. The researchers have also shown that PC1 is effective against a number of different strains of bacteria, including some that are resistant to other antibiotics. They have used a mouse model to demonstrate that PC1 can reduce the number of bacteria causing infections in mice. The researchers suggest that PC1 could be developed into a new type of antibiotic.
The hippocampus plays an important role in the construction of mental space, or the way we navigate and remember our environment. In primates, hippocampal place cells seem to encode the target of gaze, meaning what the animal was looking at, rather than the animal's position or direction. However, some previous studies in macaques and humans have shown that place cells also code for position and direction. To understand how gaze informs the construction of mental space during wayfinding, researchers have examined navigation behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity in macaque monkeys as they searched a virtual reality maze for a reward. They found that some cells in the hippocampus fired at the sight or in anticipation of a single landmark in a viewpoint- or task-dependent manner, simultaneously encoding the animal's logical situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. In addition, hippocampal activity was best fit by a fine-grained state space comprising current position, view, and action contexts. These findings suggest that the counterparts of rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge pertaining to the target of gaze, which supports self-awareness in the construction of space.
The isthmic organizer is a group of genes that helps to shape the central nervous system during vertebrate development. We studied the interactions between the genes involved in this group by analyzing their spatial patterns of expression at the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB) in mice. We found that the IsO is responsible for the maintenance of the MHB, and we predicted that Fgf8 has a maintaining rather than inducing effect on Wnt1 expression. We also found that the spatial expression patterns of these genes are not random, but are due to the action of transcription and secreted factors. Our results have implications for the study of the development of the central nervous system in vertebrates.
The paper describes a study of a protein called p104 from the parasite Theileria annulata that is found on the surface of the transforming schizont. The schizont is a stage of the parasite that enters into the host cell and causes it to grow and divide. The paper suggests that p104 can bind to a protein called end binding protein 1 (EB1) from the host cell. EB1 is important for the host cell to properly divide. By binding to EB1, p104 may help the schizont to cause the host cell to divide and produce more schizonts. The paper also explains how p104 interacts with EB1 and provides evidence for their binding.
Broken replication forks can cause DNA damage. Mild insufficiency of the replicative ligase Cdc9 in yeast resulted in persistent DNA damage and longer telomeres. Telomere lengthening required the BIR repair pathway, which is promoted by the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Pif1. The DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Pif1 promotes potentially telomere-stabilizing telomere extension while repressing deleterious de novo telomere addition events at DNA breaks. The study suggests that the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Pif1 promotes genome-preserving repair pathways.
The study tested the use of a new diagnostic tool called LIPS (luciferase immunoprecipitation systems) for onchocerciasis, a disease caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. LIPS uses recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens (Ov-FAR-1, Ov-API-1, Ov-MSA-1, and Ov-CPI-1) and measures the antibody response to these antigens to diagnose onchocerciasis. The study found that using a mixture of all four antigens simultaneously in the standard format or a quick 15-minute format (QLIPS) could distinguish between Ov-infected and uninfected control sera with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, the study found that patients infected with other filarial parasites, such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongyloides stercoralis, had markedly lower antibody titers to each of the Ov antigens compared to patients with Ov infections. Overall, the LIPS assay is a rapid, high-throughput, and specific tool that can be used to diagnose individual Ov infections and potentially detect recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Ov infection.
The study investigated the effectiveness of iron-folic acid supplementation and regular deworming to reduce anemia, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted helminth infections in women of reproductive age in a rural setting in Vietnam. The study found that after 54 months, mean hemoglobin levels rose from 122 g/L to 131 g/L, anemia prevalence fell from 38% to 18%, iron deficiency fell from 23% to 8%, and iron deficiency anemia prevalence was reduced to 4%. Additionally, the prevalence of hookworm infection was reduced from 76% to 11%, and the level of moderate or heavy infestation of any soil-transmitted helminth was reduced to less than 1%. The study concluded that population-based interventions can effectively reduce anemia and practically eliminate iron deficiency anemia and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted helminth infections in a rural setting. The study also identified predictive factors for hematological outcomes.
Herpesviruses are viruses that establish a lifelong infection in their host, but they also have ways to avoid the host's immune response. One way that EBV does this is by expressing a protein called gp150 during the late phase of the viral life cycle. This protein blocks the presentation of antigens by HLA class I, HLA class II, and CD1d molecules, which are important for the host's immune response. gp150 does this by shielding the surface molecules with glycans, which makes them less likely to be recognized by the immune system. This is a novel immune evasion mechanism in herpesviruses, which means that it has not been seen before.
Chlamydia trachomatis is a bacterium that causes sexually transmitted disease and is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. This bacteria undergoes a developmental cycle between an infectious form (EB) and a replicative form (RB) inside a membrane-bound compartment called inclusion. It has been found that chlamydiae recruit actin to the site of attachment inside the host cell, and this recruitment is important for bacterial entry. However, the mechanism of this recruitment is unclear. Researchers have found that C. trachomatis harbors a protein called Tarp, which can directly induce actin polymerization. The protein Tarp has three domains: an N-terminal tyrosine-rich repeat domain, a proline rich domain, and a G-actin binding domain. The proline rich domain and G-actin binding domain are conserved among all known Tarp orthologs. The research shows that Tarp orthologs from Chlamydia pneumonia, C. caviae, C. muridarum, and various C. trachomatis serovars all harbor at least one and up to four functional actin binding domains and that purified recombinant Tarps from all chlamydial species were capable of nucleating actin filament formation in vitro. Additionally, a peptide antiserum with affinity to the actin binding domain prevented Tarp mediated actin nucleation and, when delivered into host cells, significantly reduced host cell susceptibility to chlamydial infection. These findings show that Tarp mediated actin polymerization is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species and suggest that the actin binding domain plays an important role in bacterial entry.
Schistosomiasis is a type of intestinal disease caused by parasitic worms. It is common in Asia and affects many types of mammals, including water buffaloes. Determining the prevalence and intensity of the disease in these mammalian reservoirs is important for calculating transmission rates and environmental contamination. A new procedure called the formalin–ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (FEA–SD) technique has been developed to improve microscopic visualization of schistosome eggs in fecal samples from bovines and other ruminant reservoir hosts. The FEA–SD technique involves several steps, including filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion and centrifugation, prior to microscopy. The technique removes nearly 70% of bulk debris from the fecal samples, making it easier to see the eggs. The FEA-SD technique is a valuable tool for monitoring the spread of schistosomiasis in animal reservoirs, particularly in areas with low to high infection intensity, or where there is suspected elimination of schistosomiasis.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a bone disorder caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins responsible for collagen formation. These proteins are important for maintaining bone mass and bone strength. Two of these proteins, prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) and cartilage associated protein (CRTAP), are part of a complex that modifies a specific proline residue on collagen molecules. Recent research has shown that this modification is not necessary for collagen stability, but it may play a role in collagen interactions that are important for proper collagen folding. P3H1 and CRTAP stabilize each other, so when one of these genes is mutated, it can lead to loss of the entire complex and its associated functions. In this study, researchers created a knock-in mouse model that carried a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic site of P3H1. This substitution abolished P3H1 activity but retained the ability to form a complex with CRTAP and chaperone collagen trimer assembly. The knock-in mice showed no prolyl 3-hydroxylation at the modified proline residue, but there was no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. The mice were normal in appearance, had no growth defects, and normal cartilage growth plate histology, but they had decreased trabecular bone mass. The study showed that the knock-in mice recapitulated some of the bone phenotype of OI but not the cartilage and growth phenotypes caused by loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. The observations suggest that inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity may have different tissue consequences than complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex.
Transposable elements (TEs) are genetically simple but highly successful genetic elements that insert copies of themselves into new genomic locations faster than they are eliminated. TEs can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral to their host. The mutagenic properties of transposons have been harnessed by molecular geneticists to disrupt thousands of Drosophila genes. The P-element, a DNA transposon, was horizontally transferred from a distant relative, D. willistoni, into D. melanogaster. The element spread rapidly through the species, as evidenced by its absence from old laboratory stocks. In its native species and current D. melanogaster populations, the P-element is not associated with any gross defects. However, when males from strains collected after the invasion (P strains) are crossed to females from old laboratory stocks (M strains), the F1 offspring suffer a number of abnormalities, including sterility, recombination in males, increased mutation rates, and abnormally small (dysgenic) gonads. These abnormalities are collectively known as "hybrid dysgenesis" and are due to DNA damage caused by actively transposing P-element in the germline. In the reciprocal direction, the F1 offspring, though genetically identical, are normal because they are protected by piRNAs (PIWI interacting RNAs) homologous to the P-element, which target the P-element mRNA for degradation. In a recent study, the P-element was found in D. simulans, apparently horizontally acquired from D. melanogaster. The P-element causes a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in crosses between strains from different D. simulans populations, and this phenotype occurs in crosses between strains collected before and after a rapid invasion of the P-element.
Scientists have developed a new method to mark male mosquitoes to study their mating success during field releases. The method involves feeding male mosquitoes on a sugar solution containing a fluorescent dye called rhodamine B, which produces a bright red colour when fluoresced. Rhodamine B has been used in the past to mark insects, such as tobacco budworm moths, fireflies, and Drosophila. However, it has not been used before to mark mosquitoes. The study aimed to determine the optimal feeding regimes for ideal body and seminal fluid marking, as well as any potential impacts of rhodamine B feeding on male survival and mating competitiveness. The results showed that feeding male mosquitoes on a sugar solution containing rhodamine B produced long-lasting body marking and that the dye had no effect on male mating competitiveness. The study concluded that rhodamine B could be a useful evaluation method for male-based SIT/IIT control strategies as well as a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture experiments.
Superantigens are proteins secreted by some bacteria that can activate many T cells at once, causing a toxic immune response that can lead to death. These proteins bind to both major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) and T cell receptor (TCR) molecules, which are found on immune cells. However, superantigens also need to bind to a third molecule called CD28 to cause the toxic immune response. CD28 is a costimulatory receptor that helps regulate the immune response. To stop the toxic immune response caused by superantigens, researchers found that short peptides that mimic the binding site of CD28 on superantigens can block their ability to bind to CD28. These peptides also protected mice from superantigen toxicity. These findings suggest that CD28 can be co-opted by superantigens as a receptor and that blocking access of superantigens to CD28 can be an effective way to prevent toxic immune responses.
In this study, the authors examined the role of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), which are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into various types of cells. They found that the Wnt pathway controls mESC proliferation through the activity of the transcription factor Tcf1. Tcf1 is recruited to the Ink4/Arf tumor suppressor locus, which encodes for negative regulators of the cell cycle, leading to a reduction in mESC proliferation. However, the Wnt pathway does not affect pluripotency in mESCs. The authors also found that Tcf1 has specialized functions that are distinct from Tcf3, another transcription factor involved in the Wnt pathway. This study sheds light on the complexity of the Wnt pathway and its role in the regulation of pluripotency and proliferation in mESCs.
Dengue virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that can cause severe symptoms, including hemorrhagic manifestations and a shock syndrome. Dengue infection can activate plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which are innate immune cells that produce IFN-α and express TRAIL. Our study found that pDCs were activated in mild dengue cases, characterized by increased levels of IFN-α and TRAIL in the plasma. We also found that DENV-2 exposure led to mTRAIL relocalization from intracellular compartment to plasma membrane, which was regulated by endosomal viral degradation blockade by chloroquine. In vitro experiments showed that DENV-2-infected monocytes exhibited reduced viral antigens, which was dependent on IFN-α production by pDCs. Our study suggests that pDC activation may have an important role in the outcome of dengue disease.
The role of TNF in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection has been studied extensively. The current study uses a mathematical model to explore the role and production of both transmembrane TNF ( tmTNF ) and soluble TNF ( sTNF ) in controlling Mtb infection. It also investigates the effects of two anti-TNF agents, an antibody and a receptor fusion molecule, in controlling Mtb infection. The study shows that the production of sTNF is essential for controlling Mtb infection, and that the bioavailability of TNF after anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor for causing reactivation of latent infection. The study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed to balance the requirement for reducing inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified to reduce the risk of reactivation of latent infection.
Retro (pseudo) genes are copies of existing genes that form through the process of reverse transcription of mRNAs and subsequent insertion into the genome. Retrocopies are often believed to be nonfunctional "junk DNA," but they may have an intact open reading frame and be protein-coding, long noncoding RNAs, or sources of short interfering RNAs or microRNA sponges. Some retrocopies can also replace their parental genes and act as phylogenetic markers. Recent sequencing technology has allowed researchers to study the variation in retrocopies within populations. Recent studies revealed 208 polymorphic retrocopies (RDVs), which can be used as genomic markers for population history. However, many questions remained unanswered, such as how old these RDVs are and what their functional aspects are. In this study, researchers used the 1000 Genomes Project and RNA-Seq data to investigate the variation in loss of ancient retrocopies among different human populations, and the expression levels of retrocopies between populations. They also developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the reference human genome. Altogether, they were able to detect 193 RDVs, most resulting from retrocopy deletion. The frequency of their deletion was very low, and the expression, conservation, and low rate of deletion of the remaining 10 retrocopies may suggest some functionality. Additionally, they found 9 retrogenes that undergo statistically significant differential expression between populations.
Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is a disease where the larval stage (cysticercus) of a parasite called Taenia solium infects the brain. NCC causes a range of symptoms such as seizures and focal neurological signs. The symptoms of NCC depend on the number, location, and distribution of cysticerci, as well as the degree of brain inflammation and the developmental stage of the parasite. This study used naturally infected pigs as a model to compare the inflammatory response following cysticidal treatment to cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma, meninges, or both tissues. The results showed that cysticerci in the brain parenchyma caused the greatest inflammatory response following cysticidal treatment compared to cysticerci in the meninges or both tissues. This suggests that the severity of symptoms in NCC may depend on the location of cysticerci in the brain.
Yaws is a re-emerging infectious disease that is caused by a type of bacteria called Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue. It is endemic in Ghana, but there is a lack of information about the epidemiology of the disease. A survey was conducted in two districts of Ghana where mass drug administration for trachoma had previously been conducted. Children aged 5-17 years with skin lesions that were compatible with yaws were enrolled in the study. Samples for treponemal serology and lesion PCR were collected from all children. The results showed that none of the children tested positive for syphilis, but Haemophilus ducreyi was detected in 9 out of 98 lesions. This suggests that H. ducreyi may be associated with some skin lesions, but the majority of lesions remain unexplained. The survey did not find any evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws in these communities. This study highlights the importance of integrating diagnostic testing into both pre and post-mass drug administration surveillance systems to better inform yaws control programs.
HIV infection is treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), but this treatment does not completely eliminate the virus from the body. There is a small population of cells that harbor HIV, called the viral reservoir, which can contribute to the spread of the virus even after treatment ends. One way to form the viral reservoir is through a process called seeding, which involves the spread of HIV from infected cells to uninfected cells. Two drugs called tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, which are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, may be able to block this process by interfering with the Jak-STAT pathway, which is involved in the spread of HIV. This study shows that tofacitinib and ruxolitinib can reduce the frequency of CD4+ T cells that harbor integrated HIV DNA, as well as reduce viral production from infected cells. Additionally, these drugs can block the reactivation of HIV from latency, which is a key step in the spread of the virus. Overall, this study suggests that tofacitinib and ruxolitinib could be potential therapeutic options for blocking the seeding and maintenance of the HIV viral reservoir.
Scientists used microarray analysis to study how the immune response of Spodoptera exigua cells to a baculovirus changed over time. They found that the number of genes that were either up- or down-regulated during the first 36 hours of the infection was similar. Many immune-related genes were down-regulated after infection, including genes related to pattern recognition, signalling, immune pathways, immune effectors, and genes that code for proteins involved in the melanization cascade. These changes were also seen in larval gut samples. The researchers then studied how gut microbiota affect the baculovirus infection process and found that gut bacteria enhance the virulence, pathogenicity, and dispersion of the virus. They concluded that the host immune response to baculoviruses plays an important role in the pathogenesis of the infection and that the gut microbiota also plays a role.
Apomixis is a form of asexual reproduction through seeds, resulting in genetic clones of the mother plant. It has the potential to greatly improve crop yields. However, few crop species are naturally apomictic and attempts to introduce it through crossing have failed. To create apomixis in a sexual plant, the genes that confer elements of apomixis must be identified. In this study, we identified a gene in Arabidopsis thaliana that controls entry into the second meiotic division. By combining this gene with two other mutations that eliminate recombination and pairing and modify chromatid segregation, we created a genotype called MiMe in which meiosis is replaced by mitosis. This is an important step towards understanding and engineering apomixis in crops.
The current paper evaluates the usefulness of incorporating tissue-specific information into a disease gene prioritization algorithm. The paper utilizes gene expression data from 60 different human tissues to construct tissue-specific protein-protein interaction networks. These networks are then used to prioritize candidate disease genes. The authors find that the tissue-specific networks yield more accurate results compared to using a generic network. The paper also highlights the importance of tissue-specific information in disease gene prioritization.
The article introduces a new, flexible model for the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito species that transmit human diseases. The model allows for differential exposure to insecticides for males and females and allows for selection pressures and dominance values to differ depending on the concentration of insecticide encountered. The model is used to investigate the relative merits of sequential use of insecticides versus their deployment as a mixture to minimize the spread of resistance. The article demonstrates that the model can identify vector control strategies most likely to minimize the spread of insecticide resistance.
The article describes the sialome (saliva proteins) of Rhodnius neglectus, a type of bug that feeds on blood. This information can help us better understand the feeding process of these bugs, how they avoid the host's defense mechanisms, and how they transmit diseases. The data from this study will also be useful for researchers who are working on developing treatments for circulatory disorders.
In this study, researchers looked at how soil nematodes (roundworms) respond to different soil bacteria in the laboratory. They found that many of the genes that were turned on or off in response to different bacteria were involved in the nematodes' metabolism (way of breaking down food) and immune response. They then showed that changing the bacteria that the nematodes ate affected how long the nematodes lived and how well they reproduced. They also found that the amount that a particular gene was turned on or off in response to different bacteria could predict how much its mutation would affect the nematodes' lifespan and reproduction in those environments. This suggests that looking at how genes are turned on or off in response to different environments can give us information about how important those genes are in that environment. This research could help us understand how soil nematodes respond to changes in their environment, and could also help us learn more about the nematodes' genes and how they work.
The blastocyst is a stage of development in which the fertilized egg develops into an embryo. At this stage, the embryo is made up of two distinct types of cells: the inner cell mass (ICM), which gives rise to the embryo, and the trophectoderm (TE), which forms extraembryonic structures. How these cell types are determined is an important question in developmental biology. The authors investigate this question by developing a multiscale, stochastic model to investigate the design principles responsible for robust establishment of the ICM and TE in the mouse blastocyst. The model incorporates both motions and divisions of individual cells as well as gene regulatory processes influenced by cell positions and cell-cell interactions. The authors find that the inside-outside based mechanism is likely to be responsible for the high level of robustness observed, and that gene expression noise can enhance robustness of organization by promoting cellular plasticity. These results suggest that noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst.
This study investigated the basis for recognition of diverse antigens by antibodies encoded by three VH gene segments. Panels of somatically mutated antibodies encoded by a common VH gene, but each binding to a different antigen, were computationally redesigned to predict antibodies that could engage multiple antigens at once. The Rosetta multi-state design process predicted antibody sequences for the entire heavy chain variable region, including framework, CDR1, and CDR2 mutations. The predicted sequences matched the germline gene sequences to a remarkable degree, revealing by computational design the residues that are predicted to enable polyspecificity, i.e., binding of many unrelated antigens with a common sequence. This process thereby reverses antibody maturation in silico. In contrast, when designing antibodies to bind a single antigen, a sequence similar to that of the mature antibody sequence was returned, mimicking natural antibody maturation in silico. The study demonstrated that the Rosetta computational design algorithm captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition and identified key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework that are critical contributors for polyspecificity in germline antibodies. The study suggests that antibodies encoded by germline VH genes are optimal for polyspecificity and that computational design of antibodies capable of binding multiple antigens may allow the rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecificity for diverse epitope binding.
Locusts are insects that can change their behavior from solitary to gregarious depending on their environment. When locusts are solitary, they avoid other locusts, but when they are gregarious, they are attracted to other locusts and form large groups. Researchers have studied how locusts switch between these two behaviors, and have developed a mathematical model that explains how gregarious groups form. The model takes into account the way that locusts interact with each other and how their behavior changes depending on their environment. The researchers found that there is a critical density of locusts above which gregarious groups form, and that these groups are made up of a higher ratio of gregarious to solitary locusts.
This research study focuses on the process of membrane fusion in viruses that belong to the flavivirus genus, such as TBE virus. The fusion process involves a series of steps driven by triggered conformational changes of viral envelope glycoproteins, commonly referred to as fusion proteins. The study shows that when TBE virions are exposed to alkaline pH instead of acidic pH, the particles are trapped in an intermediate conformation in which the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without proceeding to the merger of the membranes. The study suggests that this intermediate state represents a transient conformation of the fusion protein required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. The study highlights the importance of this intermediate state for the overall membrane fusion process and provides new insights into the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion.
The study aimed to understand whether plant extinctions have a significant impact on the loss of evolutionary history across the angiosperm tree-of-life. To do this, the authors analyzed the unique flora found within the Cape region of South Africa and used detailed phylogenetic information to identify which plant species are at risk of extinction and how they are distributed taxonomically. They compared the taxonomic distribution of extinction risks between the Cape and the UK floras and used detailed phylogenetic data for the Cape to identify the factors likely driving extinctions. The study revealed an unusual phylogenetic signal in extinction risks for plants and demonstrated how species' present-day vulnerabilities can be explained by their recent evolutionary past. This study provides important insights into the conservation of plant species and the importance of preserving evolutionary diversity.
Researchers have found that two proteins, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav1, are involved in the immune response to the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. These proteins are recruited to phagocytic cups containing C. albicans yeasts or hyphae, but are absent from mature phagosomes. BTK and Vav1 localize to cuff regions surrounding the hyphae, while Dectin-1 lines the full length of the phagosome. These proteins colocalize with the lipid PI (3,4,5)P3 and F-actin at the phagocytic cup, but not with diacylglycerol (DAG) which marks more mature phagosomal membranes. The researchers also found that BTK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phagocytic cup and the subsequent recruitment of PKCε. Finally, BTK- or Vav1-deficient peritoneal macrophages display a defect in both zymosan and C. albicans phagocytosis, and BTK- or Vav1-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C. albicans infection than wild type mice.
Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a virus that affects cattle and humans, causing symptoms such as fever and headaches in humans and abortions in cattle. RVF has been reported in various eco-climatic areas, including arid areas in Western Africa, sub-humid areas in Eastern Africa, wet forests in central Africa, and humid highlands in Madagascar. The roles of direct and vectorial transmissions are unevaluated in both humans and cattle. To better understand RVF transmission patterns in Madagascar, we used a combination of environmental, cattle, and human data. Our analysis showed that humid environments and high cattle density were associated with increased risk of RVF in both cattle and humans. We also found that frequent contact with raw milk was associated with human infection. Using mathematical modeling, we could further assess the contribution of vectorial or direct transmissions in each eco-climatic area.
In recent years, scientists have discovered that certain proteins, called prions, can infect and replicate within other cells. Prions are made up of proteins that self-propagate into an infectious form. These infectious forms of proteins are called prion-like aggregates. Prion-like aggregates can be made by many different types of proteins, including proteins found in bacteria, yeast, and humans. Scientists have found that prion-like aggregates can be infectious, even if the proteins themselves have the same amino acid sequence. This suggests that prions are more than just a specific sequence of amino acids - they are a specific protein fold that is self-replicating and infectious.
In this study, the authors introduce a novel approach to population genetic inference using deep learning. They demonstrate that deep learning can be effectively employed for population genetic inference and learning informative features of data. As a concrete application, they focus on the challenging problem of jointly inferring natural selection and demography in the form of a population size change history. The method is able to separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection. They apply their method to 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia to infer both their overall demography and regions of their genome under selection. They find many regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps, and fewer under selection on standing variation or balancing selection. Additionally, they find that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. Their demographic inference suggests that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) E6/E7 oncoproteins are necessary for the development of cervical and other genital tract cancers, and also increase the risk of head and neck cancers. HPV16 E6/E7 oncoproteins were found to impair the FA-BRCA pathway, which is involved in repairing ICLs (intrastrand or interstrand crosslinks). HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins prevent the FA pathway from repairing ICLs and make cells more sensitive to DNA crosslinkers. HPV E6 and E7 increase FancD2 monoubiquitination, but delay its deubiquitination, which is necessary for repairing ICLs. HPV E6/E7 also impair FancD2 colocalization with double-strand breaks and reduce FancN expression, which are necessary for ICL repair. These findings show that HPV16 E6/E7 oncoproteins disrupt the FA-BRCA pathway and contribute to the development of HPV-associated cancers.
Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus, which is spread by black flies in Latin America. The Southern Chiapas focus is one of the largest onchocerciasis foci in Latin America, with 559 communities at risk. The Mexican government has been using Mectizan (ivermectin) since the 1990s to treat the affected communities twice a year. In 2003, 50 of these communities began receiving Mectizan four times a year, and another 113 communities were added to the quarterly treatment regimen in 2009. The aim is to eliminate transmission of the parasite. In 2011, entomological surveys were conducted in six sentinel communities and three extra-sentinel communities, and no infected black flies were found. This suggests that the transmission rate in the vector population is less than one infective fly per 2,000 flies tested. Additionally, serological assays were conducted on 4,230 children, and only two individuals were found to be exposed to the parasite, with an exposure rate of less than 0.5%. These results suggest that O. volvulus transmission has been interrupted in the Southern Chiapas focus, meaning that there is a very low risk of new transmission. This is good news, as it means that the goal of eliminating onchocerciasis in Mexico is being met.
The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is a type of bacteria that can infect animals and humans. It can survive in soil but becomes infectious when consumed by humans. When inside a host, it invades cells and replicates. A protein called PrfA controls the genes that help the bacteria survive and spread within the host. To study the role of PrfA, scientists have created mutations that make PrfA active even without the normal trigger. They found that the bacteria secrete a small peptide pheromone called pPplA, which helps the bacteria escape from host cell vacuoles and may stimulate PrfA to help them grow and spread inside the host.
This study used a tool called transposon sequencing analysis (Tn-seq) to screen for genes in the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that are important for resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS) during infection in mice. The Tn-seq analysis was performed by comparing the gene requirements for colonization in untreated and antioxidant-treated adult mice. The study found that mutants of the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system, such as MutS, had a significant colonization advantage in untreated mice, but not in antioxidant-treated mice. This advantage was found to be due to the accumulation of catalase-overproducing mutants and rugose colony variants in antioxidant-treated mice. The study also found that the mutation rate of wildtype colonized in antioxidant-treated mice was significantly higher than that in antioxidant-untreated mice. The study suggests that V. cholerae employs a temporal adaptive strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes. Additionally, the study developed a strategy to study bacterial temporal hypermutation in vivo and found that hypermutators display colonization advantages in ROS-rich mouse intestines.
The study investigates the function of the protein Mlh1-Mlh3 in meiosis and mismatch repair (MMR) in yeast. Mlh1-Mlh3 is an endonuclease that plays a role in resolving DNA strand crossovers in meiosis and resolving mismatched DNA in MMR. The study used genetic analysis to analyze a large number of different mutations in the Mlh1-Mlh3 gene. The results showed that some mutations specifically disrupted MMR, while others specifically disrupted crossing over in meiosis. The authors suggest that defects in Mlh1-Mlh3 can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates. The study provides a structure-function map for Mlh1-Mlh3 and suggests that defects in the endonuclease activity of Mlh1-Mlh3 can lead to errors in meiosis and MMR.
The excessive use of antibiotics has led to the rapid increase of resistant bacteria strains, requiring the discontinuation of antibiotics and the introduction of new drugs. The switch to new drugs slows down resistance, but only temporarily. Researchers have found that heterogeneity in the contact structure of the host population plays an important role in the reversion dynamics. Host contact structure affects both the phase of intense use of antibiotics and the phase after discontinuation of the drug. During intense use, heterogeneity in the contact structure results in a non-random distribution of resistant strains among the infected population, and this pattern persists even after discontinuation of the drug. The results of the study show that heterogeneity in the contact structure slows down the reversion to a sensitive population and reduces the probability of reversion occurring after treatment is stopped. The study highlights the importance of considering host contact structure in understanding the reversion dynamics of resistant strains.
The article explores the role of multiple genes in causing autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). ASDs are heritable conditions characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. In the article, the authors describe how they used fruit flies to examine the effect of altering the dosage of unique human-fly orthologues of candidate genes that were found in individuals with ASDs. They also demonstrate that dosage changes in unique human-fly orthologues of candidate genes that were found in individuals with ASDs led to neurological defects similar to those previously reported in Drosophila models of ASD-associated variants. The authors also observed that pairwise dosage changes in orthologous pairs of candidate genes, drawn from the same single human de novo CNV, led to synergistic effects that contributed to neurological defects in Drosophila. This study shows that synergistic effects resulting from large structural variation can contribute to human diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders.
A study has looked at how certain T cells are involved in the development of a severe form of malaria called cerebral malaria. Researchers have found that these brain-infiltrating T cells accumulate within the perivascular spaces of the brain and have arrested behavior during the development of cerebral malaria. The researchers have also found that these brain-infiltrating T cells form cognitive interactions with certain immune cells in the brain, but this event is redundant for the development of cerebral malaria. The researchers have also found that these brain-infiltrating T cells do not cause apoptosis (cell death) in the brain, but extensive vascular leakage occurs during the development of cerebral malaria. Overall, the study suggests that the brain-infiltrating T cells mediate cerebral malaria via direct recognition of cognate antigen on target cells without the need for additional in situ secondary activation in the brain by professional antigen-presenting cells and without causing apoptosis.
Tungiasis is a parasitic disease caused by a tiny insect called Tunga penetrans, also known as jigger fleas. These fleas live on the skin of people and animals and can cause severe discomfort, pain, and disability. Tungiasis is most common in communities living in precarious conditions in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The study was conducted in 21 villages in western Kenya and involved examining 437 participants, 5 years old and above. The study found that the overall prevalence of tungiasis was 21.5%, and the highest prevalence was found in participants aged 14 years and below. The study also identified several factors that contribute to the occurrence of tungiasis, including low economic status, poor housing, lack of toilet facilities, and poor personal hygiene practices. The study highlights the need for further research and interventions to control and eliminate tungiasis in affected communities.
Auxin and cytokinin are two major plant hormones that interact in a negative way in several processes such as meristem maintenance, axillary branching and lateral root initiation. They also influence each other's synthesis, metabolism and signalling. Cytokinin has been shown to be an important regulator of auxin transport, which is crucial for the proper positioning of protoxylem cells in the Arabidopsis stele. This study investigates the auxin distribution and flux via the PIN transporters in the Arabidopsis root tip and explores the possible functional consequences. The authors use a parsimonious computational model of auxin transport, which takes into account cell shape, polarity and the presence of cell walls. They demonstrate that an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels is not necessary for correct and robust auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response, rather than variations in cytokinin levels, are the mechanism for the necessary feedbacks, which can amplify and stabilise the auxin maximum. The model also reveals that pericycle cells on opposite xylem poles compete for auxin accumulation, consistent with the observation that lateral roots are not initiated opposite to each other.
In this study, researchers found that a protein called CREB-B is involved in the locust's behavioral plasticity. CREB-B is a type of transcription factor, which means it helps change the way that other genes are expressed in the brain. The researchers found that CREB-B is activated when the locust changes from being solitary to being in a group, and that it is regulated by a chemical called NPF2. They also found that another type of transcription factor called CREB-A is activated by a different chemical called NPF1a, and that it is responsible for the immediate change in locomotor activity. Overall, this study provides important information about the mechanisms involved in locust behavioral plasticity and how it can be regulated by different chemicals and proteins.
Researchers have found that the activation of the zygotic genome is delayed during the early stages of embryonic development in most organisms. In Drosophila melanogaster, the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) occurs after the degradation of maternally provided RNAs and the initiation of widespread zygotic transcription. Several genes, including those involved in sex determination and pattern formation, are transcribed as early as cycle 8. The zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) plays a key role in regulating the expression of these early genes. The researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map the genomic landscape of ZLD binding during the MZT. They found that ZLD binds to thousands of regions before the MZT, many of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. Some of the regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 include the promoters of genes transcribed during this stage. Additionally, ZLD was found to be bound at cycle 8 to the promoters of roughly a thousand genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT. ZLD was also bound to virtually all known and presumed enhancers bound at cycle 14 by transcription factors that regulate patterned gene activation during the MZT. These results suggest that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT.
A team of researchers has mapped protein-protein interactions (PPIs) among circadian clock proteins in a yeast-two-hybrid approach. They found 109 novel PPIs and validated a sub-fraction via co-immunoprecipitation experiments. They also predicted the interaction dynamics within their network in mouse liver cells. Genetic perturbation studies (RNAi and overexpression in oscillating cells) suggest a crucial role of dynamic regulation (via rhythmic PPIs) for the molecular clockwork. Systems analysis on a global scale regarding circadian regulation of biological processes via rhythmic PPIs suggests a time-of-day dependent organization of the interactome. The findings of this study provide a valuable resource of circadian PPIs within hepatocytes that are important for keeping the pace of the molecular clockwork and controlling cellular physiology.
Ascaris suum is a large intestinal roundworm that causes a serious infection in humans and animals. The worm produces a protein called ABA-1A, which is involved in transporting small lipids within the worm's tissues. The authors have used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology to determine the three-dimensional structure of ABA-1A, which is a tandemly-repeating polyprotein. They have discovered that the protein has a novel seven-helical fold, with two discrete hydrophobic cavities that bind lipids. The authors believe that the identification of the structure and binding sites of ABA-1A will lead to a better understanding of the role of this protein in the infection caused by A. suum.
Ciguatera is a kind of fish poisoning that happens around the world, especially in places that are hot and have coral reefs. It can cause people to feel sick, sometimes very sick, for a long time. It is not easy to tell if someone has ciguatera, so it is often under-diagnosed and under-reported. A questionnaire was sent to officials in some Pacific Island countries to find out how common ciguatera is in those places. The results show that ciguatera is more common than we thought, and it is getting more common. This is a big problem that needs to be addressed. To solve this problem, we need to learn more about ciguatera and how it happens, so we can come up with ways to prevent it from happening.
Chagas disease is a life-threatening illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi . The disease can cause heart failure and can be difficult to treat with medication. The population of CD4+CD8+ T cells in people with chronic Chagas disease may play an important role in the body's response to the infection. However, it is not well understood how CD4+CD8+ T cells are affected by the disease or by treatment with benznidazole. This study aimed to learn more about the role of CD4+CD8+ T cells in chronic Chagas disease and how they respond to treatment with benznidazole. The study included 38 patients with chronic Chagas disease and 12 healthy controls. The researchers stimulated the cells with T. cruzi antigens to analyze the production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules by CD4+CD8+ T cells. They also studied the expression and co-expression of inhibitory receptors in these patients after treatment. They found that the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells was higher in Chagas disease patients compared with healthy donors. Additionally, they found that the ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations was higher in Chagas disease patients than in healthy donors. The researchers also found that CD4+CD8+ T cells from Chagas disease patients expressed and co-expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors. After treatment with benznidazole, the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells was reduced and the ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations was decreased. Additionally, the researchers found that the co-expression level of the inhibitory receptor was reduced after treatment simultaneously with an enhancement of the multifunctional capacity of CD4+CD8+ T cells. Finally, the researchers found an increase in the frequency of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF-α after treatment. Overall, the study suggests that CD4+CD8+ T cells could play an important role in the control of T. cruzi infection and that benznidazole treatment may reverse the exhaustion process in these cells.
The article describes the importance of phosphoinositides in plant growth and development, and the need to better understand the role of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C2 (AtPLC2) in these processes. The authors report that AtPLC2 is the primary phospholipase in phosphoinositide metabolism and is involved in seedling growth and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana. They used lipidomic profiling and heterologous expression to identify the function of AtPLC2 and found that it is involved in the production of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate. These findings provide insight into the role of AtPLC2 in plant growth and development and the link between phosphoinositides and the ER stress response.
The reductionist approach in science assumes that the best way to understand a physical system is to look at it at its smallest scale. This is known as the micro level. However, this approach has been challenged by showing that cause-effect power can occur at the macro level, and that this power can be higher than the micro level. To do this, a measure of cause-effect power called integrated information (Φ) was developed, and it was shown that macro levels of organization have emergent properties that are not apparent at the micro level. This means that a macro level can "beat" the micro level in terms of cause-effect power. These results suggest that the reductionist approach may not always be the best way to understand a physical system.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during energy production in mitochondria. These side products of electron transport can cause damage to cells in certain conditions. Scientists have been studying ROS production in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC), which is responsible for producing the majority of cellular energy. Electrons are transported through the RC in a process called electron transport, which is coupled to proton translocation and creates a transmembrane potential. However, the specific details of this process are not yet fully understood. Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the complex interactions between different parts of the RC. They have been able to fit this model to data obtained from rat brain mitochondria, and to predict the conditions under which a state of high free radical content can occur. This new insight into the mechanisms of ROS production in the RC will be useful for understanding the causes of organ transplantation failure and certain systemic diseases.
Intracellular transport is an important function in cells, and is made possible by motor proteins that use energy to move cargo along microtubules. These proteins work in teams to transport cargo over long distances. Mutations in motor proteins can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease. In this article, researchers studied the effects of mutations on the transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. They found that mutants with altered stall forces might determine the average velocity and run-length, even when they are outnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. They also developed a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types, which can be used to model mutations in motor proteins and the effects of these mutations on the transport of a common cargo. This method can also be used to introduce alterations of various single motor parameters to model a mutation and to deduce effects of the mutation on the transport of a common cargo by multiple motors.
In the field of neuroscience, it is often believed that animals like humans learn by forming a connection between specific stimuli and their outcomes. This is known as stimulus-response learning. However, this may not be the case. Recent evidence suggests that animal learning may be a process of selecting and adapting behavioral policies. Calcium influx through high-voltage-gated calcium channels plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity, and mutations in the CACNA1C gene have been associated with severe learning deficits and psychiatric disorders. To understand how learning is affected in these cases, researchers studied learning in terms of behavioral strategies using a selective functional ablation of the Cacna1c gene. They found that the majority of Cacna1c knockout mice still managed to increase reward feedback across trials but did so by adapting an outcome-based strategy. In contrast, the majority of matched controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association rule. This highlights the importance of studying behavioral strategies in order to gain a better understanding of learning processes and the underlying mechanisms. The results may also have implications for treating psychiatric disorders.
Scientists are trying to control mosquito-borne diseases by using bacteria called Wolbachia to make Aedes aegypti mosquitoes less likely to carry and spread viruses. The scientists have found that the Wolbachia infection wMel, which was introduced into mosquitoes from Drosophila melanogaster, is the best option for invasion and persistence, but it may have some fitness costs. They have also found that the Wolbachia infection wMelPop-CLA, which was also introduced from Drosophila melanogaster, is good for population suppression but may have high fitness costs. Other Wolbachia infections have different effects and are better suited to different environments. The scientists have also found that temperature affects the reproductive effects of Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and that the optimal temperature for Wolbachia reproductive effects is not yet known.
The article describes a study done on adenoviruses, which are a group of viruses that cause infections in humans. The study found that chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, and macaques shed large amounts of adenoviruses in their stool. This is different from what was seen in humans, where adenovirus shedding in stool was much less common. The researchers also found that the adenoviruses from apes were related to three different types of human adenoviruses. This suggests that these adenoviruses could be used as vectors for genetic vaccines or gene therapy in humans. However, the researchers caution that handling and housing of primates should be done carefully because of the high level of adenovirus shedding in their stool.
The nucleosome is the basic unit of chromatin in eukaryotic cells. It consists of a core of histone proteins and DNA. The DNA in a nucleosome is wound around the histone core like a rope around a pole. To function properly in the cell, this DNA needs to be unwrapped. Scientists used computer simulations to calculate the energy needed to unwrap the outer turn of the DNA in a nucleosome. They found that it takes about 11.5 kcal/mol to unwrap the outer turn. They also found that the unwrapping happens in an asymmetric way, meaning that one end of the DNA unwraps more than the other end. This unwrapping happens in a stepwise fashion, with about 5 base pairs unwrapping at a time. These findings provide insight into how nucleosomes function and how they are involved in processes such as gene expression and DNA repair.
The article describes the role of a protein called ApoD in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can damage the membrane of lysosomes, which are important organelles in the cell that help break down waste and damaged cellular material. ApoD is a protein that binds to lipids and is found in the blood. It is also over-expressed in the aging brain and in neurodegenerative diseases. The authors found that ApoD is endocytosed and targeted to a subset of vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. Once inside the lysosome, ApoD is able to help maintain lysosomal pH gradients and prevent lysosomal membrane permeabilization. This helps to protect the cell from oxidative stress. Additionally, the authors found that ApoD is necessary for two lysosomal-dependent processes, such as myelin phagocytosis and optimization of autophagy. The authors conclude that ApoD is a previously unknown but important regulator of lysosomal membrane integrity, which has wide-ranging implications for many diseases.
In a recent study, researchers investigated the life cycle and susceptibility of Phlebotomus orientalis sand flies to Leishmania donovani, the parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL). They found that the two colonies of P. orientalis originated from different sites in Ethiopia had distinct life-cycle requirements and genetic makeup, but were able to produce viable hybrids. They also found that both colonies were highly susceptible to infection with L. donovani, and that the infective dose was as low as one or two promastigotes per blood-meal. The results of this study provide important information about the life cycle and susceptibility of P. orientalis sand flies to VL, which can help improve the management of the disease in the region.
The paper is about a study that aimed to estimate the disability weight (DW) of advanced schistosomiasis japonica, a serious health condition caused by infection with a type of tapeworm. The study used a patient-based evaluation and the EQ-5D plus questionnaire to assess the health status and DW of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica in China. The results showed that the overall DW for advanced schistosomiasis japonica was 0.447 and that age-specific DWs ranged from 0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged ≥60 years. The study also found that the DW of advanced schistosomiasis japonica was positively associated with certain factors, such as loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were protective factors for quality of life. These patient-preference disability estimates could provide updated data for a revision of the global burden of disease, as well as for evidence-based decision-making in China's national schistosomiasis control program.
Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal African Trypanosomiasis (AAT) are both highly prevalent in Africa. HAT is caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma brucei and is transmitted by tsetse fly bites. AAT is also caused by trypanosomes and is transmitted by tsetse fly bites. The parasites that cause AAT also cause disease in livestock, leading to decreased agricultural production, poverty, and nutritional deficiencies. The impact of both HAT and AAT on human health occurs through two exposure pathways: directly from the bite of a pathogenic tsetse fly resulting in HAT infection or indirectly, as the potential for AAT takes land out of agricultural production and diseased livestock leads to livestock morbidity and mortality, contributing to poverty and nutritional deficiencies. This study analyzed data from a national census in Kenya in 1999 to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's 7 tsetse belts where tsetse vectors for T . b . rhodesiense and other trypanosoma agents that cause AAT were present. It used a multilevel study design to estimate the likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, nested within tsetse fly habitats of varying levels of poverty. It found that residents and recent migrants of working age living in tsetse belts had a higher likelihood of disability than those living outside of tsetse belts, regardless of poverty levels. The study also found that residents had a higher likelihood of disability than migrants, likely due to increased duration of direct and indirect exposure to tsetse flies and poverty. Gender differences were also found, with women having a higher likelihood of disability than men. Housing type also appeared to vary vulnerability to disability in tsetse-endemic environments. This study suggests that national census data can be used as a tool to estimate population vulnerability and disability within and across tsetse belt regions as a potential indicator of HAT-acquired infection.
The article discusses the role of a drug called hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) in inducing the production of HIV viral particles in chronically infected cells. The article suggests that HMBA activates a pathway called the PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation of a protein called HEXIM1 and the release of another protein called P-TEFb from a complex with HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA. This results in the recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV promoter, where it stimulates the elongation of viral transcription. Despite the continued presence of HMBA, the released P-TEFb quickly reassembles with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1. The article also mentions that a mutant version of HEXIM1 that cannot be phosphorylated by Akt prevents the HMBA-mediated induction of viral production.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites that spread through the bite of infected sand flies. The parasites can lead to different types of leishmaniasis, including mucosal and disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis, which are more severe forms of the disease. In these forms, parasites spread to multiple parts of the body and cause severe inflammation and tissue damage. A recent study found that a virus found in some strains of Leishmania, a parasite responsible for leishmaniasis, is responsible for the more severe forms of the disease. The study used various techniques to detect the virus, including using an anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody and nucleic acid purification. These techniques were tested on different parasite strains and found to be effective in detecting the virus. The study proposes that these techniques could be used as diagnostic tools in the field to predict the risk of developing more severe forms of leishmaniasis.
Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EPEC and EHEC ) are closely related pathogens that attach tightly to intestinal epithelial cells and trigger the formation of actin pedestals, which are structures that help bacteria to move across the surface of cells and invade the intestinal lining. In this study, researchers used a combination of genetic and cellular techniques to investigate the role of these pedestals in infection and colonization. They found that EPEC and EHEC both formed distinct communities of bacteria called macrocolonies, which encompassed multiple host cells. Tir and EspFU, two key proteins involved in pedestal formation, were required for the expansion of these macrocolonies over time. Unexpectedly, EspFU accelerated the formation of larger macrocolonies compared to EPEC Tir, as EspFU-mediated actin assembly drove faster bacterial motility to cell junctions. This study revealed that EspFU enhances epithelial colonization by increasing actin-based motility and promoting an efficient method of cell-to-cell transmission.
This article describes how to properly isolate extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the excretory-secretory products of Fasciola hepatica, a liver fluke that causes a major neglected zoonotic disease in humans and ruminant species worldwide. There is currently no gold standard for EV isolation, but the most widely used method for helminth pathogens is differential centrifugation (DC). However, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been used to purify EVs from other pathogens and there is no evidence that DC is the best method for purifying EVs from helminth pathogens. In this study, the authors compared DC and SEC EV purification methods for F. hepatica EVs. They found that SEC produced smaller, more homogeneous EVs that had a higher purity and lower contamination from free excretory-secretory products (ESP). They also found that SEC EVs had different protein and gene enrichment profiles compared to DC EVs. Overall, the authors recommend using SEC for EV isolation for helminth pathogens, as it produces high-quality EVs that can be used for further research and development.
In this study, we investigate the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in early development using the Drosophila melanogaster embryo as a model system. We analyze the dynamics of gap gene expression using reverse engineering to fit a model to quantitative data. We find that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for the correct timing and positioning of gap protein domain boundaries. However, it may play a role in controlling accurate protein levels, possibly through changes in translational efficiency and protein stability.
Rotavirus causes diarrhea in children and is shed by the body after recovery. Neonatal mice are highly susceptible to rotavirus infection and exhibit severe symptoms, whereas adult mice remain asymptomatic and shed low amounts of virus. To understand why adult mice are not susceptible to rotavirus infection, we investigated the role of the innate immune system in neonatal and adult mice. We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 expression is low in the intestinal epithelium of neonatal mice but strongly increases during the postnatal period, which correlates with increased susceptibility to rotavirus infection. In contrast, TLR3 expression is low in adult mice. We also found that adult mice deficient in TLR3 or TIR domain containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (Trif) had significantly higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes as compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in TLR3 or Trif did not display impaired cell stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Using chimeric mice, we found that the Trif-mediated antiviral host response was detected in the non-hematopoietic cell compartment in adult animals. Finally, we also found a significant increase in TLR3 expression during infancy in human small intestinal biopsies. These results suggest that the upregulation of TLR3 expression in the intestinal epithelium of infants might contribute to their susceptibility to rotavirus infection.
This paper reports the results of a study that used whole-exome sequencing to look for genetic variants associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study sequenced 1,039 people with ASD and 870 controls with similar ancestry. The study found that rare genetic variants were distributed similarly in both sets of samples, indicating that the data from the two different sequencing centers could be combined. The study then used different methods to analyze the combined data for associations with ASD. It found that combining the data before analyzing it (mega-analysis) was more powerful than combining the results of the different analysis methods (meta-analysis). The study also found that using principal components analysis to control for ancestry in the combined data was effective in reducing bias. Overall, the study did not find any clear-cut genetic associations with ASD.
Mycetoma is a disease that affects the skin and underlying tissue, and it causes nodules and sinuses that release pus. It can be caused by bacteria or fungi, and the fungus Madurella mycetomatis is the most common cause in Sudan. The study aimed to investigate if polymorphisms in two chitinase genes are associated with eumycetoma caused by M. mycetomatis. The study found that one polymorphism in the chitotriosidase gene, resulting in decreased chitotriosidase activity, was associated with an increased risk of eumycetoma. No associations were found between the polymorphisms in the AMCase gene and eumycetoma risk. Chitin is a major component of the cell walls of fungi, and chitinases are part of the immune system and play a role in fighting fungal infections. The study suggests that decreased chitinase activity may increase the risk of eumycetoma, but further research is needed to confirm this.
Herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) is a virus that has the ability to stay dormant or latent in the body for a long time. During this time, the virus is not actively spreading, but it is still alive and can potentially reactivate at any time. However, a new study challenges the idea that HSV latency is clearly defined. The study found that around half of the spread of the virus leading to latent infections happened after the initial infection, which means that the virus was still actively spreading even after it had entered the latent phase. In addition, the study also found that proteins from the lytic phase of the virus, when it is actively spreading, can be produced even during the latent phase. This means that the virus is not completely dormant during latency, but it is still able to produce proteins that could potentially harm the host. The study used a highly sensitive mouse model to make these findings, and the results challenge our understanding of how viruses behave during latency.
Prion diseases are a group of fatal brain diseases that affect both humans and animals. They are caused by the misfolding of a protein called PrP, which leads to the formation of abnormal, protease-resistant isoforms of PrP called PrPSc. PrPSc is responsible for the spread of the disease within the brain and other organs. In this study, the authors examined the cell specificity of PrPSc accumulation in mice infected with three different scrapie strains. They found that each strain had a different pattern of cell specificity, with one strain mainly associated with astroglia, another with neurons, and the third with both. Despite the differences in cell specificity, the authors found that all three strains had similar patterns of upregulated genes associated with neuroinflammation. Interestingly, the pattern of gene upregulation in scrapie differed markedly from the pattern seen in two acute viral CNS diseases. This study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of prion diseases and may lead to new therapeutic approaches.
The physical organization of chromosomes inside the cell nucleus plays an important role in regulating gene expression. Chromosomes are long and densely packed, which makes it difficult to study their folding and dynamics. We have proposed a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers, which allows us to investigate the structural and dynamical properties of chromosomes more efficiently. We have used our strategy to study the 3D organization of chromosome 3R in drosophila during one cell cycle, and our results show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduces experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predicts that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle. Our work provides a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes and paves the way for studying the folding and dynamics of long chromosomes during an extended time period with good statistics.
Gene expression is controlled by regulatory proteins, RNAs, and cis-regulatory elements with which they interact. These cis-regulatory elements can be located near the gene they regulate, or far away from it. Genetic variants within cis-regulatory elements can affect gene expression in a cell type specific manner. These variants are referred to as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). They are common and exist in both cis and trans (over long genetic distances). Many of the genetic associations found in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are with non-coding single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), making their mechanistic interpretation more challenging. However, it is known that regulatory SNPs have causal roles in many complex human phenotypes. This is supported by the fact that GWAS associations are enriched within DNase I hypersensitive sites and eQTL SNPs. Although eQTLs are increasingly used to provide mechanistic interpretations for human disease associations, the cell type specificity of eQTLs presents a problem. To address this need, we performed an eQTL analysis in three parts. First, we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types. Then, we integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project. Finally, we built a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. We demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs using cell-specific CRE-SNP overlap as features. We also demonstrated that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. We anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.
The authors have developed a new cell line that can produce human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) vaccine immunogens that limit the incorporation of sialic acid into the vaccine proteins. Sialic acid is a type of carbohydrate that can interfere with the binding of certain monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the vaccine proteins. The new cell line was created using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system and contains a mutation that inactivates the gene encoding Mannosyl (Alpha-1 , 3- ) -Glycoprotein Beta-1 , 2-N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (MGAT1), which is responsible for adding sialic acid to the vaccine proteins. The authors tested the vaccine proteins produced in the new cell line and found that they bound better to certain mAbs than the vaccine proteins produced in normal cells. The authors also found that the new cell line was able to grow at high densities and produce the vaccine proteins at large scales, making it useful for manufacturing HIV-1 vaccines. The authors concluded that the new cell line they created was a useful tool for producing HIV-1 vaccine immunogens that were better able to bind to certain mAbs.
Parasitic nematodes cause devastating diseases in many parts of the world. These diseases are caused by species of the genus Brugia and Wuchereria bancrofti. Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP) is an enzyme required for the survival of these nematodes. In humans, the equivalent enzyme is not present, making T6PP a promising target for therapeutic inhibitors. The structure of T6PP from Brugia malayi has been determined, and it has been found to have a stabilizing N-terminal MIT-like domain and a catalytic C-terminal C2B-type HAD phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses using a designed competitive inhibitor, trehalose 6-sulfate, have identified five residues important for binding and catalysis. This study provides the basis for the development of broad-range anthelmintic and antibacterial therapeutics.
The study presents a novel computational framework to simulate blood flow and interstitial fluid transport in tumours. The framework incorporates whole tumor microvascular networks extracted ex vivo to generate accurate predictions of tumor fluid dynamics. The study details the application of the framework to an orthotopic murine glioma and a human colorectal carcinoma xenograft. The framework enables highly-controlled experiments to be performed that provide insight into how tumor vascular heterogeneity contributes to tumor fluid transport. The study also performs sensitivity analysis to gain an understanding of the key biological mechanisms that determine tumor fluid transport. The framework incorporates spatially heterogeneous blood vessel lumen and interstitial permeabilities to generate accurate predictions of tumor fluid dynamics. The study mimics vascular normalization by modifying parameters such as vascular and interstitial permeabilities. The study hypothesizes that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumors.
HIV spreads efficiently from infected to non-infected cells through cell-cell contacts. However, it is unclear whether cell-cell transmission is equally important in human infection. Neutralizing antibodies can inhibit HIV infection by blocking attachment to receptors or preventing membrane fusion. It is also unclear how much the enclosed environment of the viral synapse protects the virus from neutralizing antibodies. The study used specially tailored experiments to distinguish between cell-cell and cell-free virus transmission modes. The results showed that CD4 binding site-directed neutralizing antibodies, such as VRC01, lost potency during cell-cell transmission. This suggests that these antibodies act preferentially by blocking free virus transmission. The study provides important insights for vaccine and entry inhibitor design.
The paper proposes a simple model that explains how attention can affect neural responses in the visual system. Attention can cause response rate changes (response gain, input gain, and biased competition) and receptive field changes (shifts and resizing), which occur at higher levels of the visual system. The model requires the existence of modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. Feedback connections redistribute the top-down modulation to lower areas, altering the inputs of other higher-area cells. Simultaneously, short-range lateral inhibition produces competitive effects automatically scaled to receptive field size. The model can explain all effects of visual attention, such as response rate changes and receptive field changes. The model also makes a novel prediction: attentional effects on response curves should shift from response gain to contrast gain as the focus of attention shifts away from the center of the studied cell’s receptive field.
Drosophila's immune system is controlled by a signaling center called the PSC, which regulates the production of immune cells. In this study, researchers identified a gene called CG14225/Latran that is involved in controlling the PSC. They found that CG14225/Latran forms heteromers with another gene called Dome and that these heteromers have the opposite function of Dome. When CG14225/Latran is not present, Dome is able to signal, which leads to the production of immune cells. However, when CG14225/Latran is present, it binds to Dome and prevents it from signaling. This is important because it shows that the immune response is regulated by a complex interplay of different genes, and it provides a new understanding of how the immune system works.
Begomoviruses are a type of virus that can change their genetic material through a process called recombination, which is the process by which two or more different types of genetic material combine to make a new type. This can happen when the same virus infects a plant at the same time, or when two different viruses infect the same plant. The study looks at how recombination happens within begomoviruses, and how it can disrupt interactions between different parts of the virus genome. By looking at patterns of recombination in different viruses, the researchers were able to understand more about how viruses change over time and how they can adapt to different environments.
The relationship between nucleosomes, DNA sequence, and evolution has been studied in humans and other eukaryotes, revealing biases in mutation and selection that may be correlated with nucleosome positioning. However, the assumption that experimentally determined nucleosome positions reflect ancestral positions and thus inform us about the chromatin context in which substitutions occurred may be incorrect. Here, we investigate if nucleosomes are repositioned following a change at the sequence level, and how this could affect the observed relationship between nucleosome positioning and sequence evolution. We compare substitution patterns around nucleosome footprints in humans to substitution dynamics in Haloferax volcanii, a haloarchaeon with nucleosome-like structures that differ from those in eukaryotes. We found that nucleosome-associated substitution patterns in both humans and Haloferax volcanii are remarkably similar, despite the differences in nucleosome structure and global nucleotide substitution profiles. We conclude that these dyad-oriented trends break down in the respective sister lineages, suggesting that the causal link between genetic and epigenetic change must be considered when assessing selection and mutation biases in the context of chromatin architecture.
The study explores the conformational diversity of proteins and its relationship to ligand-binding. The authors find that key positions involved in ligand-binding are evolutionarily conserved, mostly buried aliphatic residues located in regular structural regions of the protein like β-sheets and α-helix. The authors propose a novel procedure to identify these key positions based on the effect of mutations on subspaces defined by normal modes most involved in the conformational change. These normal modes are selected according to their corresponding overlap with structural distortions introduced by ligand binding. By analyzing the effect of simulated point mutations on preserving the conformational diversity of the protein, the authors identify critical sites for protein function. These sites are evolutionary conserved and play an important role in ligand-binding. The study suggests that normal modes subspaces associated to ligand-binding can provide valuable information for understanding the relationship between protein structure, function, and evolution.
Metabolic pathways used by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to establish and maintain infections are important for our understanding of pathogenesis and the development of new chemotherapies. In this study, the authors investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA), which is central to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. They created a strain of Mtb in which FBA levels were regulated by anhydrotetracycline. Depletion of FBA resulted in clearance of Mtb in both the acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo, and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. They found that Mtb's ability to adapt to multiple environments may in part be attributed to its metabolic flexibility and its capacity to efficiently catabolize multiple carbon sources simultaneously. The authors further found that FBA was an essential enzyme for both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and that Mtb relied on FBA for both growth during acute and persistence during chronic mouse infections. The study highlights the importance of FBA as a potential drug target in both replicating and persistent Mtb.
The paper presents a study of the function of a type of protein called 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (2-Cys PRX) in a parasitic protozoan called Leishmania infantum. These proteins are thought to have a function in reducing peroxides, which are harmful molecules produced in cells, but there is also some evidence that they can regulate signaling pathways in cells. The study used a strain of L. infantum that lacks the 2-Cys PRX gene, which was generated by a gene replacement strategy. It showed that these mutants were not able to survive in a mouse model of infection and that this was not due to their lack of 2-Cys PRX peroxidase activity. The study also showed that mTXNPx can have a function as a molecular chaperone. The study is important because it provides evidence that 2-Cys PRXs can have functions in parasites that are independent of their peroxidase activity.
Histoplasmosis is a fungal disease that affects many parts of Latin America, including Mexico. The standard way to diagnose the disease is to find the fungus in a sample such as bone marrow or blood. However, this method can take a long time and requires special safety equipment. In the US, doctors can use a test that detects antigens in the urine of patients. In 2007, a new version of this test called ALPHA-HUAg was approved for clinical use and allowed doctors to use it on-site, which is useful in regions outside the US. However, this version of the test is not as accurate as the original test. We did a study to see how well the ALPHA-HUAg test works to diagnose progressive disseminated histoplasmosis, a serious form of the disease that affects HIV-infected patients. We did this study at 10 hospitals in Mexico, including 2 that were considered tertiary care and 8 that were considered secondary care. We included 288 HIV-infected patients who had symptoms that could be due to progressive disseminated histoplasmosis. We compared the results of the ALPHA-HUAg test to the results of a more accurate reference standard, which was to find the fungus in a sample such as bone marrow or blood, or through a histopathology exam. We found that the ALPHA-HUAg test had a sensitivity of 67.1% and a specificity of 97.5%. This means that the test correctly identified 67.1% of the patients who had progressive disseminated histoplasmosis, but it incorrectly identified 2.5% of the patients who did not have the disease. The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2, which means that if a patient tested positive, they had a 27.2 times greater chance of having progressive disseminated histoplasmosis than they did of not having the disease. However, we found that 10.5% of the patients who had progressive disseminated histoplasmosis also had a co-existing opportunistic infection, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection. This means that a negative ALPHA-HUAg result does not rule out progressive disseminated histoplasmosis and a culture-based approach is necessary since co-infections are frequent and a negative IMMY-HUAg result does not rule out PDH.
The study used metagenomic sequencing to analyze the viral communities present in diarrhea specimens from 12 children. The method used minimal sample quantity, limited sequencing, and no purification of the samples. The study found evidence for the detection of known enteric viruses, viral co-infections, and novel viruses.
The Zika virus, which can cause birth defects, is a mosquito-borne disease that has been spreading rapidly in the Caribbean and South America. The Dominican Republic is no exception. In 2015, the country experienced a large dengue epidemic, and then in 2016, cases of Zika began to appear. Researchers wanted to learn more about the spread of both diseases in the Dominican Republic and to understand the risk factors for transmission. They analyzed data from the country's disease surveillance system to look at the age and sex distribution of both Zika and dengue cases, and to calculate the reproductive number (R0) of each outbreak.
Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are proteins that transfer poly (ADP-ribose) units onto target proteins. This process is important in a variety of cellular processes, including DNA repair. In humans, the PARP1 protein accounts for more than 90% of overall cellular PARP activity in response to DNA damage. In Arabidopsis, however, it appears that PARP2 makes the greatest contribution to PARP activity and organismal viability in response to genotoxic stresses. PARP2 also makes a stronger contribution to plant immune responses, including restriction of pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato growth and reduction of infection-associated DNA double-strand break abundance. Poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) enzymes are responsible for removing poly (ADP-ribose) from acceptor proteins. In humans, there is one PARG gene. However, in Arabidopsis, there are two PARG genes: PARG1 and PARG2. It appears that PARG1 rather than PARG2 is the primary enzyme that counteracts poly (ADP-ribosyl) ation in Arabidopsis. PARP1 associates with PARP2, and both proteins interact with both PARG1 and PARG2. These findings suggest that PARP and PARG proteins play important roles in plant DNA damage and immune responses.
The PHR proteins, called RPM-1 in C. elegans, are important signaling hubs that help regulate the formation of synapses and the termination of axons. In the nematode C. elegans, the PHR proteins, including RPM-1, have been found to help regulate habituation to repeated touch stimuli. By using suppressor genetics, the authors of this study have identified a new JNK pathway that is involved in regulating synapse formation in mechanosensory neurons of C. elegans. This pathway includes several kinases, including MIG-15, NSY-1, JKK-1, and JNK-1, and is distinct from the pathway that RPM-1 typically regulates. The authors found that loss of function mutations in these kinases specifically suppress defects in synapse formation in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants. Additionally, transgenic overexpression of kinases in this pathway in wild-type animals led to impaired synapse formation. The study provides new insights into the role of JNK signaling in synapse formation and habituation to touch stimuli in the nematode C. elegans.
The paper investigates a protein called TRA-1 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which controls whether the animal develops as a male or a hermaphrodite. TRA-1 is a "bipotential" protein, meaning that it can activate or repress the same gene depending on the context. The paper confirms that TRA-1 is bipotential by showing that it can both promote and repress the expression of a gene called fog-3 in germ cells, and also by testing for epistasis with another gene called TRR-1. The paper also shows that TRR-1 is a co-factor of TRA-1 that works to promote the expression of fog-3. The paper compares the role of TRA-1 in C. elegans with its role in a related species, C. briggsae, and finds that although TRA-1 has the same basic functions in both species, the two species use different mechanisms to regulate its activity. The paper suggests that this difference in regulation may have evolved to compensate for changes in the relationship between TRA-1 and other genes that control sex determination. The paper concludes by suggesting that the structure of a bipotential switch, like TRA-1, can change rapidly during evolution, and that these changes can affect the way that a binary switch controls an important biological process like sex determination.
The paper introduces two new measures of 'integrated information' that can be used to measure the complexity of a system's dynamics. The first measure is called 'integrated information' and is used for discrete Markov systems, while the second measure, called 'empirical integrated information', is used for continuous systems. The authors use simulations to demonstrate the practical applicability of these measures and explore their properties. They also propose a new measure of 'auto-regressive integrated information' that can be used for non-Gaussian systems. The authors argue that these new measures offer new opportunities for studying the dynamics of real and model systems, as well as for exploring the relationship between integrated information, consciousness, and other neurocognitive processes.
Sleeping sickness is a disease caused by parasites that are spread by tsetse flies. There are two types of sleeping sickness in Uganda: Rhodesian and Gambian. Rhodesian sleeping sickness has been spreading in Uganda over the past few decades. Recent research has tried to understand why this disease is spreading by looking at social, environmental, and climatic factors that may be causing the spread. The current study used statistical methods to analyze data from the past few years in Uganda. The results show that the movement of livestock may have contributed to the spread of Rhodesian sleeping sickness in certain areas. The study also confirmed the effects of other factors on the spread of the disease, such as the distance to a health center and the amount of green vegetation in a particular area. Overall, the study provides important insights into how Rhodesian sleeping sickness is spreading in Uganda, and how different factors may be affecting this spread.
The paper explores the relationship between complexity and stability in ecological systems. The "consensus that complexity begets stability" was challenged in the 1970s, and the authors of this paper provide new analytical results and simulations that show that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species-rich systems. They also found that stability and feasibility are warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Furthermore, they found that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically-inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. The authors conclude that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture.
The bacterium Coxiella burnetii causes a disease called Q fever, which affects both animals and humans. The bacteria can be found in many parts of the world, with a near-global distribution. There is a lack of understanding about the prevalence of C. burnetii in Africa, which is why this research was conducted in parts of Western and Nyanza Provinces, Western Kenya. A cross-sectional survey was conducted where blood samples were taken from 2049 humans and 955 cattle in 416 households. Questionnaires were also administered to collect information on demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information. Environmental data, such as land cover, were also linked to the survey results. Correlation and spatial-cross correlation analyses were used to examine the potential link between cattle and human seroprevalence. Multilevel regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between a range of socio-economic, demographic, and environmental factors and sero-positivity in both humans and animals. The results showed that the overall sero-prevalence of C. burnetii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle. However, there was no evidence of correlation between cattle and human seroprevalence, either within households or when incorporating spatial proximity to other households in the survey. The research also identified several factors that were important for exposure to C. burnetii, including purchasing cattle from market, lower precipitation levels, younger age group, variations between ethnic groups, and frequent livestock contact. The implication of livestock markets in cattle exposure risks suggests these may be a suitable target for interventions.
In this paper, researchers identified three genes that are similar to vasa, which is a marker of germ cells, in the genome of the schistosome worm (S. mansoni). These vasa-like genes are expressed in different stages of the schistosome life cycle, with the highest expression in the undeveloped egg. The researchers believe that this information could be used to monitor transgenesis in the schistosome germ line, which is an important step towards developing new treatments for schistosomiasis.
Heart valves are critical for the correct flow of blood in the heart. They develop from cells that go through a special process called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This process involves a lot of cell proliferation and the formation of structures called cushions. The Hippo pathway is important for organ development and tissue homeostasis. VGLL4 is a protein that is important for this process. It is mainly expressed in cells that form cushions. Deleting VGLL4 in the cells that make cushions results in problems with the development of the valves. This happens because YAP, a protein that is important for cell proliferation, is not controlled properly. If you partially delete YAP in the heart, the problems with the valves can be fixed. These findings suggest that VGLL4 is important for the development and maintenance of heart valves and that controlling the activity of YAP could be a potential therapy for preventing problems with heart valves.
In this study, researchers examine the use of "soft selective sweeps" in explaining the patterns of genetic variation observed in natural populations. A soft sweep is a scenario where a beneficial mutation reaches high frequency in a population, but not to fixation. There are two main models of soft sweeps: selection on standing variation, where a beneficial mutation is already present in the population at appreciable frequency, and multiple de novo beneficial mutations, where multiple copies of the same beneficial mutation arise in the population. However, researchers argue that the evidence for the existence of soft sweeps is not strong. They note that many of the patterns of variation that are predicted by soft sweeps models are also predicted by other, simpler models of population genetics. They argue that most of the evidence for soft sweeps is likely due to false positives or a failure to account for other factors affecting genetic variation, such as demographic history. Overall, the study suggests that the concept of soft sweeps is overused and misinterpreted in the literature, and that a better understanding of the underlying population genetics is needed to accurately identify instances of positive selection.
This study aimed to identify the receptor responsible for a humoral factor that suppresses host-seeking behavior in female mosquitoes after they have fed on blood. The humoral factor is called Head Peptide-I and it has been shown to be involved in this inhibition. The study used a calcium imaging assay to screen for receptors that respond to Head Peptide-I. The study found that the receptor NPYLR1 was a candidate for the sNPF neuropeptides that are sensitive to Head Peptide-I. However, mutant mosquitoes with NPYLR1 removed did not show any changes in feeding or inhibition of host-seeking behavior, so it is likely that there are other signaling mechanisms involved in this important behavioral regulation.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that is spread by water and can cause serious health problems. This study aimed to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission using satellite imagery and spatial analysis for Akure North Local Government Area in Ondo State, Nigeria. The study used a multi-criteria evaluation method to determine the weight of each individual schistosomiasis risk factor, including temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/land cover. The weighted overlay analysis was done after each factor was given its appropriate weight. The results showed that 82% of the area fell under the high and very high risk category, with one community having the lowest risk and four other communities having varying levels of risk. The study found that environmental factors can be used in identifying and predicting the transmission of schistosomiasis, as well as effective monitoring of disease risk in newly established rural and agricultural communities.
The article discusses the effects of bacterial meningitis on the brain, specifically the loss of synapses in the superficial layers of the frontal neocortex. This is particularly seen in patients with pneumococcal meningitis and mice with pneumococcal meningitis who express the pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin. The article also highlights the role of the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and D-AP5 in reducing this pathology. Additionally, the article shows that pneumolysin increases glutamate levels in the brain and that it induces excitotoxic damage by dysregulating the control of glutamate in the brain.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are associated with many types of cancer, including cervical, head, and neck cancers. HPV has a complex life cycle that is closely linked to the differentiation of the host epithelial cells. In order to fully understand this life cycle, researchers have developed new methods to create infectious particles of HPV. Using these particles and infecting human keratinocytes, the researchers found that cell cycle progression through early stages of mitosis is critical for successful HPV infection. These findings reveal new insights into the mechanism by which HPV infects cells and provide one reason why HPV infects only undifferentiated, proliferating cells. These results also provide new leads for developing preventive and therapeutic strategies against HPV infection.
We looked for microRNAs (miRNAs) in the fungus Penicillium marneffei, which causes a respiratory disease called talaromycosis. MiRNAs are small molecules that control gene expression in animals and plants, but their existence in fungi was not well studied. We found that miRNAs exist in P. marneffei and are expressed differently in mycelial and yeast phases of the fungus. This is the first evidence that miRNAs are expressed differently in different growth phases of a fungus.
In 2013, the Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in French Polynesia and spread across the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. Several mosquito species may have been involved in the spread of ZIKV, including Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis. This study evaluated the ability of wild populations of Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis collected from different Pacific islands to transmit ZIKV. Infection and transmission rates were analyzed for the ZIKV strain that circulated in this region during the 2013-2017 outbreak. The results showed low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations studied. These results suggest that other factors, such as vector density, mosquito lifespan, and the immunologically naive fraction of the population, may have contributed to the rapid spread of ZIKV in the Pacific region.
Xist is a long non-coding RNA that controls gene expression by inactivating one of the two female X chromosomes during mammalian development. To better understand the structure of Xist in cells, the researchers developed Targeted Structure-Seq, which combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing. By enriching for signals from the RNA of interest, Targeted Structure-Seq achieves high coverage of the target RNA with relatively few sequencing reads, thus providing a targeted and scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. They used this approach to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA and develop new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat A element in the 5’-end of Xist. This analysis also identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved, including a new element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function.
The study proposes a novel statistical framework that allows us to evaluate and compare the performance of genetic risk prediction models for complex diseases. The study suggests that it is not enough to only use one measure, such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate the performance of genetic risk prediction models. Instead, a variety of prediction metrics should be used to make a more complete assessment of the model's performance. The study introduces a unifying statistical framework that allows us to estimate and compare a range of prediction metrics, such as the AUC, mean risk difference, net reclassification improvement, proportion of cases explained, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile. The study also demonstrates how to construct graphs to visualize the performance of risk models, such as the ROC curve, density of risks, and predictiveness curve. The results of the study show that the proposed framework is able to accurately estimate the prediction metrics and that it is useful for evaluating the performance of genetic risk prediction models. The study also applies the framework to nine complex diseases and evaluates the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants for each trait.
Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a parasitic disease that affects over 70 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. The most common form of the disease is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, which in 2015 accounted for over 97% of all reported HAT cases. The card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT) is a widely used screening test for HAT that detects antibodies using a suspension of purified and stained bloodstream-form trypanosomes expressing LiTat 1.3 variant surface glycoprotein, a predominant variant antigen of T. brucei gambiense. However, CATT has been reported to have low sensitivity and specificity, and operational challenges such as the need for an agitator, electricity, and refrigeration have limited its large-scale implementation for passive screening in health facilities in remote locations. To address these challenges, two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have recently been developed, the HAT Sero-K-SeT and the SD BIOLINE HAT, which detect host antibodies using the same two antigens, VSG LiTat 1.3 and VSG LiTat 1.5. A comparison of these two RDTs in an independent study using stored plasma samples concluded that there was no difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two tests. However, a comparison of both RDTs in a prospective study showed that their sensitivity was not different from the sensitivity of CATT, while their specificity was 1.3% lower. A new RDT, the SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, has now been developed using recombinant antigens. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 in a multi-centric, prospective study in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to demonstrate its non-inferiority to SD BIOLINE HAT. As a secondary objective, the accuracy of SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 was compared to that of CATT. The study found that the highest sensitivity was achieved with SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 (71.2%), followed by CATT (62.5%) and the SD BIOLINE HAT (59.0%). The most specific test was CATT (99.2%), while the specificity of the SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 were 98.9% and 98.1% respectively. Sensitivity of the tests was lower than previously reported as they identified cases from partially overlapping sub-populations. The study also found that all three tests were significantly more sensitive in passive than in active screening. Combining two or three tests resulted in a markedly increased sensitivity: When the SD BIOLINE HAT was combined with the SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, sensitivity reached 98.4% in passive and 83.0% in active screening. While the practicality and cost-effectiveness of algorithms including several screening tests would need to be investigated, using two or more tests appears to enhance sensitivity of diagnostic algorithms, although some decrease in specificity is observed as well.
The article "Effectiveness of multiple indoor residual insecticide spraying rounds in reducing vector infestation and human seroprevalence of Chagas disease in Comapa, Guatemala" describes the impact of multiple rounds of indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS) on Chagas disease transmission in the municipality of Comapa, Guatemala. The study found that after multiple rounds of IRS, the infestation index decreased significantly from 39% to 27%. However, the seroprevalence in women of child-bearing age remains high, above 10%, indicating that there is still a risk for congenital transmission. The study suggests that systematic integrated vector control and improved Chagas disease screening and treatment programs for congenital and vector-borne disease are needed to reach the elimination goal in regions with persistent vector infestation.
The article is about the study of Citrobacter rodentium, a natural pathogen that causes disease in mice. The researchers found that the genome of C. rodentium is unstable due to large-scale genome recombination and the activity of mobile genetic elements. The researchers sequenced an additional C. rodentium strain to confirm that their previous findings were consistent. They found that the reference strain ICC168 is representative of the species and that most inactivating mutations were common to both isolates. The researchers draw parallels with other bacterial pathogens and conclude that C. rodentium is a recently evolved pathogen that may have emerged alongside the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease.
The paper presents a new method for inferring the biochemical mechanisms underlying the shape of protein distributions across cell populations. The method uses stochastic modeling of gene expression processes and analytical solutions to the first four moments of the protein distribution to fit the model parameters to experimental data. The method is assumption-free and can infer rates of chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation. The method can identify specific molecular mechanisms that underlie protein distributions, such as transcriptional bursting or constitutive transcript production. The method is more efficient and provides more information than previous methods. The method is applicable to a wide range of genes and can be used to gain insight into the mechanisms of gene expression.
Monkeypox is a disease caused by the Monkeypox virus (MPXV) that is endemic in West Africa and sporadic in Central Africa. Smallpox vaccination provides good protection against MPX, but the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980 and a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected. Disease control of MPXV hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, if that fails, interrupting person-to-person spread. The World Health Organization has reported an increasing number of human cases of MPX in recent years. The reason for this increase is unclear, but it may be due to several factors, such as increasing human-animal interactions through environmental degradation, the cessation of routine vaccination against smallpox, an increase in human susceptibility to the virus, an increase in animal-human and human-human transmissibility of the virus, and the adaptation of the virus to new host species. Because the smallpox vaccine is not effective against MPXV, new and efficacious vaccines to protect against human MPX are needed. A new approach to vaccination is being explored based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins (A29L, M1R and B6R). The three recombinant BoHV-4 vectors were shown to be safe and effective at protecting 100% of STAT1(-/-) mice from mortality and 80% of STAT1(-/-) mice from morbidity against a lethal MPXV challenge. This study demonstrated the efficacy of BoHV-4-based vectors and the potential of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform for developing new vaccines to protect against human MPX.
This article describes the role of ALPH1, a protein found in trypanosomes, in the process of mRNA decay. Trypanosomes are single-celled parasites that cause sleeping sickness in humans and other animals. The deadenylation process, in which the poly(A) tail of mRNA is shortened, is an important step in the decay of mRNA in trypanosomes, as it is in other eukaryotes. However, trypanosomes do not have the same protein complex as other eukaryotes that is involved in the next step of mRNA decay, which is the removal of the cap from the mRNA. The authors of this article have found that ALPH1, a protein previously identified as a stress granule protein in trypanosomes, is the enzyme that removes the cap from mRNA in these parasites. They have also found that ALPH1 is essential for the survival of the parasites and that it is involved in the global increase in mRNA levels that occurs when deadenylation is complete but mRNA decay has not yet begun.
Recently, it was shown that newborn baby pancreatic cells can turn into adult insulin-producing cells by just expressing one gene. Now, researchers have found that adult pancreatic cells can also turn into new insulin-producing cells by inhibiting the expression of another gene. The researchers used a mouse model to show that when they turned off the gene Arx in adult alpha cells (which produce glucagon), those alpha cells turned into new beta cells that produce insulin. The new beta cells were able to reverse diabetes in the mice. This could lead to new treatments for diabetes in people.
Scientists have discovered that replication of certain parts of the genome in a yeast cell can be restarted after they have already been replicated once. They have also found that certain genetic elements can be used to trigger this restart process in specific parts of the genome. This discovery challenges the idea that all parts of the genome replicate equally and suggests that the replication process may be more complex than previously thought.
Entamoeba histolytica, a parasite that causes invasive amebiasis, is increasing among men who have sex with men and is becoming a problem in developed East Asian countries where it is also co-infected with HIV-1. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in most cases, but recurrence of amebiasis was common in high risk populations. Recurrence was more frequent in those who had hepatitis C antibodies or who acquired syphilis during the follow-up period. Different genotypes of E. histolytica were identified in some cases, but there was no correlation between genotype and clinical features.
Gambian sleeping sickness (HAT) is a deadly disease caused by parasites transmitted by riverine tsetse flies. The WHO aims to eliminate HAT as a public health problem by 2020 and stop transmission by 2030. In the south of Chad, a persistent focus of HAT remained, with over 100 cases diagnosed and treated annually until 2013. In 2014, tsetse control was added to medical interventions to further reduce transmission and consequently, reduce annual incidence of HAT. The control involved the deployment of ‘tiny targets’ that attract and kill tsetse, and a census of the human population and their settlements was conducted before control began. The tsetse population declined after target deployment, and mathematical modeling showed that 70% of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 could be attributed to vector control. The tiny targets were also estimated to have reduced new infections by 63% due to tsetse control, with 8% due to enhanced passive detection. The modeling predicted that elimination as a public health problem could be achieved by 2018 in this focus if vector control and screening continue at the present level. The tsetse control combined with medical interventions has played a major role in reducing HAT incidence in 2014 and 2015.
Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by a roundworm called Strongyloides stercoralis. It can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, skin rash, and difficulty breathing. This parasite can be transmitted through contaminated soil or water, and can persist in the body for years without reinfection. Immunosuppressant conditions, such as corticosteroid therapy or HIV infection, can cause the parasite to multiply, leading to severe symptoms like hyperinfection syndrome. Imported cases of strongyloidiasis are being diagnosed more often in non-endemic areas, such as Spain, due to increased migration and travel. This study analyzed data from a Spanish collaborative network to describe the characteristics of imported strongyloidiasis cases, as well as factors that affect the burden of the parasite and the success of treatment.
Vaccines are important for protecting against infectious diseases. When creating vaccines, it is important to consider the amount of antigen or attenuated pathogen that is used as the inoculum dose. Higher doses usually lead to better stimulation of the immune response but can also cause more severe side effects and allow for less population coverage in the presence of vaccine shortages. Determining the optimal amount of inoculum dose is an important part of rational vaccine design. By combining mathematical models with experimental data, we can determine the impact of the inoculum dose on important outcomes such as immune protection and morbidity. This can help in determining the best balance between low dose to reduce costs and side effects and high dose to trigger a robust immune response. We illustrate this concept using data from two infection experiments: influenza A virus (IAV) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. Our findings show that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. This framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and determination of the optimal amount of inoculum dose.
Filaments of a specific type of cyanobacterium, Anabaena, develop a pattern of specialized cells called heterocysts that fix nitrogen under nitrogen-poor conditions. Before this developmental process begins, many aspects of gene expression are unknown. In addition, it is unclear how gene expression fluctuations are coupled between cells along a multicellular filament. In this study, the authors studied the statistics of gene expression fluctuations for a protein essential for heterocyst differentiation, HetR, both under steady-state growth in nitrogen-rich conditions and at different times after nitrogen deprivation. They found that expression fluctuations of HetR in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic spatial range of circa two to three cells. This sets the scale for cellular interactions along a filament. Correlations between cells mainly arise from intercellular molecular transfer and less from cell division. Fluctuations after nitrogen step-down build up on those under nitrogen-replete conditions. The authors also found that several factors known to play a role in differentiation after nitrogen deprivation also play a role before differentiation is triggered. These factors set an underlying pattern of spatial correlations of gene expression along filaments on which the developmental pattern may later be built. The authors provide evidence of the participation of an intercellular communication protein in setting these spatial correlations at specific times during differentiation. These findings provide insights into how developmental patterns can arise in multicellular organisms and how noise in gene expression can be controlled during development.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a type of virus that causes encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) in humans and reproductive disorders in pigs in the Asian Pacific region. The virus has three main types: genotype I (GI), genotype II (GII), and genotype III (GIII). A recent study found that the dominant type of JEV in China has shifted from GIII to GI. To understand why this has happened, researchers conducted a survey of JEV infection in pigs and compared the replication of different strains of JEV in various cells in a laboratory. They found that GI viruses replicated more efficiently than GIII viruses in certain types of cells, which could lead to more JEV being spread in the environment. This could in turn lead to more JEV being transmitted from animals to mosquitoes, and eventually from mosquitoes back to animals, creating a more efficient cycle of transmission.
Biofilm formation in the fungus Candida albicans is controlled by six transcription factors. To understand how these transcription factors work together to regulate biofilm formation, researchers used a genetic interaction approach. They generated all possible double heterozygous mutants of these transcription factors and analyzed the genetic interactions between them. The results showed that the six network heterozygous mutants all had altered biofilm formation. In addition, many double heterozygous mutants were as severely affected as homozygous deletions. As a result, the network was found to be highly interdependent and efficient but not robust. The researchers also found that some transcription factors have sensitive expression and that some transcription factors cooperatively interact with others. Finally, they found that the heterozygous NDT80 deletion mutant was hyperfilamentous under both biofilm and hyphae-inducing conditions in a TEC1-dependent manner. Overall, the results provide new insights into the functions of individual transcription factors and the role of the overall network topology in its function.
Leishmaniasis is a serious disease caused by parasites that can lead to death if not treated. Asparagine (Asn) is a nonessential amino acid that is made by a protein called asparagine synthetase (AS). There are two types of AS: type A and type B. Type B uses glutamine or ammonia to make Asn, while type A only uses ammonia. Surprisingly, parasites called trypanosomatids, including the ones that cause leishmaniasis, have a type A AS. Previous research showed that this type of AS is essential for the survival of Leishmania donovani parasites. However, the current study has found that type A AS is not essential for the survival or growth of Leishmania infantum parasites. Therefore, this type of AS is not a suitable drug target for treating Leishmania infantum parasites.
Toxocariasis is a common infection caused by parasites that can cause inflammation and damage to various parts of the body. This infection is often associated with other illnesses, including epilepsy, a condition that causes seizures. However, there is a lack of conclusive evidence to establish a causal link between these two conditions. Therefore, a systematic review of all available studies was conducted to determine the relationship between toxocariasis and epilepsy. After analyzing 204 publications, 11 case-control studies were included that involved 4,740 participants. The results showed a positive association between toxocariasis and epilepsy, suggesting that the infection may play a role in the incidence of this condition. However, this relationship is still debated and further research is needed to fully understand the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy.
A recent study discovered a new way that the protein called ATM controls the body's response to DNA damage caused by radiation. This response involves microRNAs (miRNAs), which are small molecules that can control the production of other proteins. The study found that a specific miRNA, miR-335, is controlled by a protein called CREB, and that miR-335 can control another protein called CtIP, which is important for repairing DNA damage. This repair process involves a method called homologous recombination, which is used to fix certain types of DNA damage. The study found that patient-derived cells with too much miR-335 were defective in their ability to repair DNA damage, which made them more sensitive to radiation than normal cells. The study also found that reducing the level of miR-335 in these patient-derived cells restored their ability to repair DNA damage and made them less sensitive to radiation.
When it comes to understanding and interpreting others' behavior, humans have a tendency to assign mental states to them, such as beliefs, emotions, and intentions. This process of "mentalizing" is quite sophisticated and can lead to adaptive social skills like convincing, teaching, or deceiving. In this study, researchers tested whether sophisticated recursive beliefs were important for learning in social interactions. They asked participants to play repeated games against artificial, Bayesian mentalizing agents that had different levels of sophistication. The participants were told either they were playing against each other or were gambling. Although the information provided was identical in both conditions, participants performed better when they believed they were playing against each other. The researchers suggest that mentalizing was important for learning in the social interaction and that it might not be possible to decipher intentional behavior without attributing mental states to others.
The current study presents a new algorithm for analyzing biological networks using a statistical model called Gaussian graphical model (GGM). GGM helps to understand the complex relationships among molecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins, and plays an important role in various biological processes and diseases. However, existing methods for analyzing biological networks in a high-dimensional setting are inefficient and not statistically rigorous. The new algorithm proposed in this study is efficient and statistically rigorous, and is able to make inference of GGM in real biological applications with tens of thousands of variables. The algorithm has been implemented in an R package named "FastGGM" and has been demonstrated to be several orders of magnitudes faster than the current implemented algorithm while maintaining the same accuracy. This makes it feasible to analyze whole-genome biological networks using GGM.
The striatum is a part of the brain that receives information from the cerebral cortex and sends output to other parts of the brain. It is made up of many small nerve cells called medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that fire at different times depending on the task being performed. This behavior is thought to be caused by the connections between the MSNs, which are too weak to completely inhibit other cells from firing.
Researchers have discovered a new regulatory mechanism in budding yeast that directly links cycles of exocytosis and endocytosis. This mechanism involves the Rab GTPase Sec4p, which is involved in polarized exocytosis and moves along actomyosin cables during this process. Sec4p also interacts with Las17p, a yeast Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASp) homologue, to promote actin polymerization and trigger compensatory endocytosis. This discovery could help explain how polarized growth is maintained in specific secretory cell types.
Researchers have found that when mice take acetaminophen, a commonly used pain reliever, it can cause liver damage. To better understand how this happens, researchers have been studying how the drug is metabolized inside the liver. One theory is that the drug is converted into a toxic form (NAPQI) that is produced in different parts of the liver. When this toxic form reaches a certain level, it can damage cells and cause liver failure. However, researchers have had a hard time testing this theory because it is difficult to control the different parts of the liver and measure what is happening inside it. To solve this problem, researchers used software to create a virtual model of a mouse's liver. They used this model to test different ideas about how the drug is metabolized and what happens when it reaches toxic levels. The results of these virtual experiments showed that the theory was not completely correct and that other factors were needed to explain the liver damage. The researchers think that this new information will help them better understand how acetaminophen causes liver damage and how to prevent it.
The paper describes a study done to measure the parasite burden in infants born to mothers infected with a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. The study used three different tests to diagnose T. cruzi infection in infants at different time points: the INP micromethod test at one month after delivery, a second parasitological diagnosis at six months of age, and a serology test at 10–12 months of age. The parasite burden was measured by using a method called quantitative PCR. The study also looked at the relationship between parasite burden and serology test results. Additionally, the study genotyped T. cruzi parasites isolated from 19 infected children.
The study proposes a model of Escherichia coli that predicts growth rate and cellular composition from a coarse-grained representation of its genome. The model assumes that E. coli is in a state of balanced exponential steady-state growth, growing in a constant environment that is rich in resources. The model is able to reproduce data from a series of past experiments where the growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio have been measured for seven E. coli strains with rRNA operon copy numbers ranging from 1 to 7 (the wild-type copy number). The model suggests that increasing the rRNA operon copy number beyond seven will lead to a cytoplasm that is densely packed with ribosomes and proteins, which will result in a decrease in growth rate. The study also discusses possible design principles suggested by the model and proposes further experiments to test its validity.
Plants respond to many types of environmental stresses, including drought, salinity, and cold. The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is important for plant responses to stresses. PYR/PYL/RCARs are receptors that sense ABA levels in plant cells. They bind to a family of clade-A PP2Cs, including ABI1, ABI2, HAB1, and PP2CA/AHG3, which negatively regulate ABA responses by dephosphorylating and inhibiting positive regulators of ABA signaling, such as SnRK2s. ABI5 is a downstream target of the SnRK2 kinases and is involved in seed germination and seedling development. In this work, the authors showed that RSM1, a MYB-related transcription factor, is down-regulated by salt and up-regulated by ABA. They found that RSM1 interacts with the bZIP transcription factors HY5 and HYH, which are important regulators of light signaling. The authors also found that RSM1 regulates ABI5 expression by directly binding to its promoter. In addition, they showed that RSM1 regulates the expression of other ABA-responsive genes. Together, these results suggest that RSM1 interacts with HY5 and HYH to regulate ABA and abiotic stress responses.
The study reports that complex I, a large and complicated protein complex involved in energy metabolism, links the transfer of electrons from NADH to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. In humans, defects in complex I are linked to a wide range of degenerative disorders. Recent structural analysis of complex I revealed that redox reactions are confined to the hydrophilic peripheral arm of the L-shaped molecule and take place at a remarkable distance from the membrane domain. This suggests that the proton pumping within the membrane arm of complex I is driven indirectly via long-range conformational coupling. The study provides evidence that the membrane arm of complex I contains two functionally distinct pump modules connected in series by the long helical transmission element.
Fever is a natural response to infection that increases body temperature to fight off infections. We wanted to know if fever also helps improve antibody binding to antigens, which is important for fighting off infections. To test this, we used selected antigens from two different types of infections - dengue and malaria - and measured how the binding affinity of antibodies for these antigens changed at different temperatures. We found that binding affinity increased at a temperature of 40°C compared to 37°C and 42°C. This suggests that fever may help improve antibody binding to antigens, which could make it easier for the body to fight off infections.
Actomyosin networks are important for many cellular processes including cell division, motility, and tissue morphogenesis. These networks are made up of actin filaments and myosin motors that produce contractile stress and generate cortical flow. But how these networks are able to produce and dissipate stress, and how this affects flow, is not well understood. A computational model has been developed that examines how stress production and dissipation depend on motor activity and network remodeling. The model reveals that filament turnover is required to maintain steady state flow against external resistance. The model also shows how active stress and effective viscosity depend on filament turnover, and how these dependencies combine to determine overall rates of cortical flow. These results provide a framework for understanding how animal cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling.
In this study, researchers identified a gene called ANAC060 that controls seedling growth in response to high levels of glucose or fructose in Arabidopsis thaliana. They used a combination of methods, including mapping, transgenic complementation, and mRNA analysis, to determine that ANAC060 is responsible for sugar sensitivity in a process that involves ABA signaling. The researchers also found that the Col ANAC060 allele is responsible for sugar insensitivity, and that this allele causes a truncated version of the protein that lacks a transmembrane anchor domain. This truncated version of ANAC060 is constitutively located in the nucleus. Interestingly, the Col ANAC060 allele attenuates sugar-induced ABA accumulation, which explains its sugar-insensitive phenotype. This study provides important insights into the regulation of sugar-ABA signaling and sugar sensitivity in plants.
This study investigates how bacteria use c-di-GMP, a nucleotide second messenger, to communicate within cells and produce specific outputs, such as biofilm formation and motility. The study shows that c-di-GMP signaling gains output specificity in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by being relayed to specific pathways. The authors identified a new c-di-GMP synthase gene, hsbD, which regulates twitching, swimming, swarming, and chemotaxis in P. aeruginosa by interacting with the HptB pathway. The study provides clues about how bacteria evolved to develop this new network, and how c-di-GMP signaling can be orchestrated to produce specific outcomes.
Humans can learn to associate different visuomotor mappings with different contextual cues, which can be used to switch between different mappings. This study tested whether participants could learn the association between a contextual cue (target shape) and the required visuomotor mapping, and how generalization would occur when learning a linear relationship between the two. Participants performed a rapid target-pointing task while the visual feedback was manipulated to have horizontal offsets depending on the target shape. The target shapes were taken from a continuous set of shapes, ranging from spiky to circular. After training on a subset of shape/mapping pairs, participants were tested on other shapes that were not learned before. Experimental results showed that participants applied the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that was most similar to the current one, rather than explicitly extracting the linear relationship between the target shape and visuomotor mapping and applying it generalize. The Bayesian learning model developed in this study predicted this pattern of generalization and the observed learning rate pattern, suggesting that this model provides a possible mechanism for simultaneously learning multiple visuomotor mappings.
The inferior olivary nucleus (IO) is a vital part of the brain that sends signals to the cerebellum to help with motor skills. These signals come in the form of "climbing fibers" and they are important for the cerebellum to function properly. It was thought that the timing of these signals was related to motor commands and/or motor learning, but this has not been confirmed yet. Climbing fiber signals cause a sudden increase in electrical activity in cerebellar Purkinje cells, which can be measured as large all-or-none action potentials. However, researchers have found that the climbing fiber can transmit a short burst of spikes as a result of an olivary cell somatic spike. The size of the burst may be related to the phase of the olivary cell's sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation, but it is not yet clear what factors primarily determine this size.
Iron is vital for life but too much can be toxic due to its redox properties. The liver plays a key role in regulating iron levels in the body, but the metabolism of iron in the liver and the mechanisms controlling this regulation are not fully understood. In this study, a quantitative computational model of human liver iron metabolism was constructed, which includes key regulatory components and their kinetic properties. The model was validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data and was able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. A time course simulation following an oral dose of iron was compared to a clinical time course study and the simulation was found to recreate the dynamics and time scale of the systems response to iron challenge. A disease state simulation of haemochromatosis was created by altering a single reaction parameter, and the simulation provided a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease. The model supports and supplements understanding of the role of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of experiments to improve our knowledge of this system.
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a protein structure that regulates the movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell. Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) is the process by which molecules move through the NPC. This process is critical for many cellular functions, such as transcription and protein synthesis. However, the mechanism of NCT is not fully understood. To help understand this process, researchers have developed a computational model that mimics the function of the NPC. The model takes into account the hydrophobic interactions between a molecule called a karyopherin (KAP) and a repeat domain called the phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat. These interactions are believed to play a key role in the transport of molecules through the NPC. The model also takes into account the polymeric nature of the NPC and the hydrophobic affinity of the KAP for the FG repeats. By simulating the transport of molecules through the NPC, researchers can gain new insights into the mechanisms underlying this important process.
The nonhuman primate (NHP) model is often the best experimental model for testing interventions designed to block infection by human pathogens, such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. However, using too high or too low a challenge dose may lead to false negative results and an excessive use of animals. Here, I define an optimized protocol for defining the dose of pathogen that infects 50% of the time (AID50). This protocol minimizes the number of animals, while providing an estimate of the AID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value. This can be easily applied to other challenge doses, such as AID80. The protocol is generalizable to any pathogen and animal model.
In this paper, the authors studied a first-order auditory interneuron called AN2 in crickets. They found that adaptation, which is the change in a neuron's response curve, shifts the stimulus-response curves toward higher stimulus intensities, with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery. They then compared two competing hypotheses, infomax and selective coding, to see which one could better explain the response curves of AN2 neurons. They found that adaptation reduces the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals. The response curve changes were also not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis because the amount of information conveyed about the loudest part of the signal did not increase as predicted but remained nearly constant. Less information is transmitted about signals with lower intensity.
Prions are a group of infectious particles that cause fatal diseases in humans and animals. These particles contain a modified version of a normal protein called PrPC, called PrPSc. The PrPSc protein is required to cause prion diseases. Scientists have been studying how PrPSc is formed and how it spreads. They have found that PrPSc binds to PrPC, causing it to change into another form of PrPSc. This binding happens through a part of PrPC called polybasic domains. They also found that PrPSc molecules with these domains are less infectious than those without them. Scientists also investigated how PrPSc molecules with these domains are able to cause PrPSc to form in others. They found that these PrPSc molecules are able to bind PrPC in a new way, allowing it to change into PrPSc more efficiently. These findings show that PrPC polybasic domains are not required for PrPSc to form and spread, but they are important for PrPSc molecules to be infectious. This study gives scientists more information about how prion diseases are caused and how they can be treated.
Scientists have developed a new way to understand how animals make decisions by analyzing their behavior. They used a type of artificial intelligence called inverse reinforcement learning to study how C. elegans worms make decisions about temperature based on food availability. The scientists found that the worms use different strategies depending on whether they are fed or starved. They also found that certain neurons in the worm's brain are important for these strategies. The new method could be used to better understand other animal behaviors.
Haptophytes are important algae that play a major role in aquatic ecosystems. They are essential for carbon sequestration and food for many eco-cohorts. Their importance has led to the sequencing of the nuclear genome of Emiliania huxleyi, but Chrysochromulina tobin is the first haptophyte to be sequenced. The genome of Chrysochromulina tobin is small and compact, encoding around 16,777 genes. Genes important to fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression when monitored over a 24-hour light/dark cycle. The genome also harbors a new type of xanthorhodopsin, as well as two unique RuBisCO activases. This study provides important information on the evolution, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes.
Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease with different types of tumors and molecular signatures. The so-called "triple-negative" breast cancer (TNBC) is a type of breast cancer that lacks the expression of three clinical markers (ESR1, PGR, and HER2) and often has a poor prognosis with low long-term patient outcomes. Despite having different clinical behaviors, morphologies, and molecular biologies, TNBCs and Basal-like tumors are often used interchangeably. However, they are not completely synonymous. TNBCs can also be classified as Claudin-low tumors, which are characterized by the activation of molecular pathways associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer stem cells, and the immune response. Different types of breast cancer also have different genetic and molecular characteristics. Inherited forms of breast cancer are often associated with mutations in genes that safeguard genomic integrity, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, p53, and Rb. These genes play important roles in DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and transcription. In addition to these well-known tumor suppressors, other genes, such as those involved in the DNA damage response, may also be important in breast cancer pathogenesis. Understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of breast cancer is critical for developing new and effective treatments.
Dengue fever is caused by a virus that is primarily spread by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. This mosquito typically lays eggs in artificial water-holding containers, which are common in human settlements. A study in rural Thailand found that the number and density of containers used for breeding were the primary determinants of the distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti pupae. The productivity of most container types increased significantly as habitat density increased. This suggests that a targeted approach to controlling the number of breeding sites and their density could be effective in reducing the abundance of these mosquitoes and, consequently, the transmission of dengue fever.
The intestine of the nematode C. elegans communicates with the nervous system to control development and behavior based on internal state and external cues. The study identified a protein called Rictor as part of the TORC2 complex that helps control development and behavior in C. elegans. In the intestine, TORC2 regulates expression of neuroendocrine genes, such as daf-7 and daf-28, which help determine whether the animal will undergo reproductive growth or enter the dauer larval stage in response to food and temperature. These neuroendocrine genes also influence food-dependent adult behavior. The study found that TORC2 signaling is required for food-dependent modulation of dauer entry and exploratory behavior in C. elegans.
In this study, researchers compared the gene expression patterns of embryonic stem (ES) cells and primordial germ cells (PGCs). They identified genes that are highly expressed in both ES and PGCs, and used a new computer program called CompMoby to search for DNA motifs that regulate gene expression. The researchers found that certain DNA sequences were preferentially active in ES and PGCs, and that these sequences could regulate gene expression in the context of an endogenous promoter. They also discovered that a transcription factor called NF-Y binds to one of these sequences, and that NF-Y is required for ES cell proliferation. Overall, the study provides new insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent stem cells, and highlights the potential for using systematic approaches to understanding transcriptional regulation in mammalian species.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a type of virus that causes flu-like symptoms in humans. It is a negative-strand RNA virus, which means that its genome is made up of RNA, not DNA. In order to replicate its genome and make new copies of itself, the virus needs a special protein called nucleoprotein (N) to help it make a complex called nucleocapsid. This nucleocapsid encases the RNA and helps the polymerase (another protein) make copies of the RNA. However, the nucleoprotein (N) by itself cannot form this complex. It needs the help of another protein called phosphoprotein (P). The P protein helps the nucleoprotein (N) form the nucleocapsid complex, but it also has two other jobs: it prevents the nucleoprotein (N) from binding to RNA and it prevents the nucleoprotein (N) from binding to itself. The P protein is a long protein with two folded domains and a flexible linker between them. It has a region that helps it bind to the nucleoprotein (N) and a region that helps it bind to RNA. The study shows that the P protein helps the nucleoprotein (N) form the nucleocapsid complex by folding the region that binds to the nucleoprotein (N) and by blocking the region that binds to RNA. It also shows that the P protein can bind to the nucleoprotein (N) without RNA being present and that it can disrupt the nucleocapsid complex once it has bound to it. This provides insight into how negative-strand RNA viruses like VSV replicate their genomes.
In the fly visual system, electrical synapses formed via gap junctions are ubiquitous, but their functional role is unclear. We used a model of the fly visual system to investigate the impact of these gap junctions on the encoding of visual motion information. We found that axonal gap junctions allowed for more efficient encoding of motion information in the vertical system, a critical network for visual processing in the fly. This efficient encoding was necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as evasive maneuvers. Our findings suggest that gap junctions may play a crucial role in efficient sensory information processing, and highlight the importance of studying the computational implications of specific connectivity patterns in neural networks.
In this study, researchers investigated how a virus called EV71 infects and replicates in human cells. The researchers found that a molecule called PSGL-1, which is found on human leukocytes, is a key receptor for EV71 to enter and infect cells. They also found that the PSGL-1 molecule is modified by the addition of sulfate groups to certain amino acids. These modifications were important for the virus to bind to PSGL-1 and infect cells. The researchers concluded that sulfate groups play a crucial role in the entry and replication of EV71 in human cells.
Leishmaniasis is a serious global health problem that affects many people worldwide. The parasite is carried by the female phlebotomine sand fly and can infect a variety of mammalian species, including humans. Once in the infected host, Leishmania persists and multiplies within phagocytic cells such as macrophages. The disease can manifest in different forms, including cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis can be treated with several agents, but drug toxicity and the emergence of resistant strains make these treatments ineffective in the long run. Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have been shown to have anti-pathogen properties. In this study, the authors tested the therapeutic efficacy of several mTOR inhibitors in controlling infection with Leishmania major in BALB/c mice. Rapamycin, GSK-2126458, and KU-0063794 were administered to the mice, which had received an intrafootpad injection of the parasite. Footpad swelling and parasite burden were assessed, and cytokine production by mouse splenocytes and phenotypic changes in draining lymph node cells were evaluated. The authors found that treatment with rapamycin or GSK-2126458, but not KU-0063794, dramatically lowered both the footpad swelling and the parasite load in the draining lymph node. The employed dose of rapamycin did not kill the promastigotes in vitro as judged by 3- ( 4 , 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ) -2 , 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) assays and electron microscopy. Moreover, the IL-4 production capacity of splenocytes harvested from infected mice that were treated with rapamycin was significantly reduced. Consequently, the IFN-γ:IL-4 production ratio was elevated, suggesting a T helper-type 1 ( Th1 ) -skewed cytokine profile. Finally, the expression level of CD69, an early activation marker, on splenic and lymph node CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was enhanced in rapamycin-treated mice. Taken together, the authors suggest that select mTOR inhibitors may be used in therapeutic settings for the management of leishmaniasis, and that the beneficial effects of such inhibitors stem from their immunomodulatory properties. They also propose that the adjuvanticity of mTOR inhibitors may be considered in vaccination strategies against Leishmania species.
Natural transformation is a common ability found in many bacteria that helps them adapt to their environment by taking up foreign DNA. In Neisseria meningitidis, natural transformation is important for the meningococcus to become virulent by acquiring new genes from other meningococci or bacteria sharing the same niche. This process involves specific DNA sequences called DUS and the DUS receptor ComP. In this study, researchers found that ComP is necessary for the transformation of N. meningitidis both with and without DUS. The bases of the DUS are important for its interaction with ComP and for the transformation process. Additionally, researchers found that a ComP homolog in N. subflava, a human commensal Neisseria species, can also bind its cognate DUS and mediate DUS-enhanced transformation in N. meningitidis. This finding suggests that co-evolution of DUS variants and cognate ComP receptors may be a mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species living in the same environment. Overall, this study provides important insights into the molecular events involved in the earliest step in natural transformation and reveals an elegant mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer.
In fungal cells, the process of cytokinesis (when a mother cell divides into two daughter cells) requires the formation of a cell wall structure called the septum, which is made of linear and branched sugar polymers. A protein called Pxl1 is important for anchoring the contractile ring (CAR) to the plasma membrane before septation (the process of forming the septum) onset. In addition, another protein, Bgs1, is responsible for forming the linear sugar polymer that is necessary for septation. In the absence of both Pxl1 and Bgs1, the CAR fails to contract and the septum is not formed. The amount of Pxl1 in the CAR increases during cytokinesis and this increase depends on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. In cells with a defective Cdc15 allele, the CAR fails to contract and septation is blocked. On the other hand, the absence of Pxl1 is lethal in cells with a defective Cdc15 allele. These findings suggest that Pxl1 and Cdc15 are important for the maintenance of the CAR and septum formation.
Glanders is a deadly disease caused by a bacterium and is known to be fatal to both animals and humans. The disease is spread by horses, which can be asymptomatic but highly infectious. In recent years, there have been several outbreaks of glanders in various regions, including Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. In 2010, Bahrain was declared free of glanders, but in 2010 and 2011, there was an outbreak in the northern region of the country. The outbreak was caused by two different strains of B . mallei, and more than 6,700 horses were infected. The study provides evidence that the outbreak was caused by two different B . mallei strains, and the results demonstrate that MLVA can be used to rapidly estimate epidemiological links among B . mallei strains. The close relationship of the Dubai/UAE B . mallei population to the BH1 and BH2 populations may be indicative of a similar geographic source that has yet to be identified. The failure of initial eradication efforts in 2010 is evidence for the need for continued surveillance and abatement measures even after all animal cases appear to be cleared. All animals imported from known or potentially endemic regions should be routinely tested for glanders before importation, and repeated testing during quarantine is recommended as infected animals may be asymptomatic and serologically negative.
American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is a complex disease that causes about 67,000 new cases each year. The disease can be caused by different types of parasites, but it is difficult to identify which one is responsible. The World Health Organization recommends treating ACL caused by Leishmania braziliensis with pentavalent antimonial derivatives such as Glucantime or Sodium Stibogluconate. However, these treatments are not always effective, and it is unclear why they fail. A study was done on a group of 43 Colombian patients who had ACL that did not respond to Glucantime treatment. The study looked at the patients' clinical and parasitological characteristics, as well as their epidemiological and geographic information. Parasite species, in vitro antimony susceptibility, and in vitro infectivity were also analyzed. The majority of the parasites found in the patients were Leishmania braziliensis, and about 35% of the parasites had decreased in vitro susceptibility to Glucantime after previous administration of the drug. There was a negative correlation between lesion size and in vitro infectivity of the parasite, as well as a negative correlation between lesion size and parasite resistance. Leishmania braziliensis was the most common parasite species found in patients who had treatment failure or relapse. This study suggests that patients with ACL caused by Leishmania braziliensis who do not respond to Glucantime treatment may have a decreased in vitro susceptibility to the drug.
Escherichia coli is a normal resident of the gut of humans and animals, but can also be a pathogen associated with diarrheal disease and extra-intestinal infections. In some strains of E. coli, a group of virulence factors is clustered on a pathogenicity island. These virulence factors are responsible for extra-intestinal infections and include the biosynthesis of four types of siderophores, which are involved in iron uptake, and a genotoxin called colibactin. The biosynthesis of the first three types of siderophores requires a 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase) that activates polyketide synthases (PKSs) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). While the E. coli EntD PPTase is responsible for the biosynthesis of enterobactin and salmochelins, which are glycosylated forms of enterobactin, and the YbtD PPTase is responsible for the biosynthesis of yersiniabactin in Yersinia, a PPTase responsible for the biosynthesis of yersiniabactin in E. coli has not yet been identified. In this study, the researchers used genetic analysis and mouse models to investigate a potential connection between the biosynthetic pathways leading to the production of siderophores and the genotoxin colibactin. They found that ClbA, a PPTase encoded on the pks island that is responsible for the biosynthesis of colibactin, can also contribute to the synthesis of siderophores. In addition, they demonstrated that the presence of either functional EntD or ClbA is required for the survival of ExPEC in vivo. Their findings highlight the interconnection between different virulence factors with distinct functions, and suggest that the association of the pks island with a high pathogenicity island in some strains of E. coli may have been selected because ClbA can contribute to the synthesis of both the genotoxin and siderophores.
The article describes a new model for evolutionary analysis that takes into account insertions and deletions along with substitutions. This model was built based on the rate matrix augmented by the gap character, and the non-reversible generative evolutionary model was constructed by extending the continuous Markov process. The proposed model was applied to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip, and it was shown that the extended program outperformed the usual approach of ignoring gaps. The authors have successfully integrated their model into a widely used phylogenetic inference tool.
The study aimed to understand how immunity to Herpes Simplex Virus ( HSV ) is initiated in humans. The first dendritic cells ( DCs ) to encounter HSV are Langerhans cells ( LCs ) in the epidermis. However, it is CD103+ dermal DCs that take the virus from LCs to lymph nodes for antigen presentation. In this study, the authors compared HSV-1 infected human foreskin explants with biopsies of initial human genital herpes lesions to show that LCs initially infected then emigrate into the dermis, where they form large clusters with BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ DCs/macrophages. HSV-expressing LC fragments were observed inside the dermal DCs and BDCA3+ dermal DCs had up-regulated a damaged cell uptake receptor CLEC9A. The authors conclude that a viral antigen relay takes place where HSV infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken up by dermal DCs for subsequent antigen presentation. This provides a rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or perhaps intradermal HSV immunization.
This study compares the biogenesis of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) formed in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with either Leishmania major or L. amazonensis. The authors used multidimensional imaging to analyze the properties of these PVs, including their size, shape, acidity, and ability to take up lysosomotropic probes. They found that the amastigotes of L. major form small PVs that fuse with each other during replication and are acidic due to the presence of lysosomes. In contrast, the amastigotes of L. amazonensis form large PVs that enlarge over time and are neutral due to the absence of lysosomes. The authors also found that PVs of L. amazonensis can fuse with each other to form even larger structures. Their findings suggest that the biogenesis of PVs varies depending on the species of Leishmania and the host cell environment.
Our study focused on the chicken B cell line DT40 and its ability to repair DNA damage through a process called homologous recombination. In this process, a DNA repair team uses a template from a related sequence to make the necessary changes. We wanted to see how the structure of the template affects the outcome of the repair. We found that the templates in DT40 have marks on their histones that indicate they are open and accessible, which may make them more attractive as templates for repair. We also found that when we prevented the templates from being open and accessible, the repair team was less likely to use them as templates. This suggests that the structure of the template is important for homologous recombination. This could be relevant to understanding how genes are changed in cancer cells or how DNA repair goes wrong in general.
The cerebellum helps us adjust our actions quickly to fit the situation we are in. It does this by comparing our current behavior with what we want to do, and then making changes to our behavior to make it better. To do this, the cerebellum uses information from the climbing fiber system, which tells it when we make a mistake in our behavior. This mistake is called an "error". The climbing fiber system tells the cerebellum about this error immediately after it happens, so that it can change our behavior to prevent the same mistake from happening again. However, we now have evidence that the climbing fiber system also helps the cerebellum remember this error, so that it can use it to help improve our behavior in the future. This is important because it means that we can learn from our mistakes and become better at doing things.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes the death of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and ultimately death. TDP-43 is a protein found in the nucleus under normal conditions but mislocalizes to the cytoplasm in ALS. TDP-43 forms aggregates, and mutations in the TDP-43 gene cause familial ALS. In a yeast model of ALS, the researchers found that TDP-43 aggregates reduce the degradation of cytosolic misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin proteasome system. However, overexpression of an Hsp40 chaperone called Sis1 rescues cells from TDP-43 toxicity, reduces the formation of TDP-43 aggregates, and restores the degradation of cytosolic misfolded proteins. Overexpression of the mammalian Sis1 homologue, DNAJB1, also reduces TDP-43-mediated toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons. These findings suggest that Sis1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS and provide insights into the mechanism of toxicity associated with TDP-43 aggregation.
Chagas disease is a major public health issue in Latin America, and finding a connection between the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite genotypes and their clinical manifestations is still a major challenge. In this study, researchers used a multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) approach to perform molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens of 65 chronic Chagas disease patients. They found that 35 (53.8%) of the patients presented positive amplification by qPCR, with 20 (30.7%) having the clinical indeterminate form and 15 (23.1%) having the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load median for all positive patients was 2.54 [1.43–11.14] parasite equivalents/mL (par. Eq./mL), with the load ranging from 0.12 to 153.66 par. Eq./mL. Notably, the parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old. Using blood samples spiked with reference T. cruzi strains belonging to the six DTUs, the researchers were able to genotype the parasite up to 0.5 par. Eq./mL with high specificity. Of the patients with positive qPCR, 28 (80%) could be identified with the T. cruzi DTU. For the remaining patients (20%), at least a partial result was obtained. The researchers observed prevalences of TcVI, TcII, and mixed infection TcVI+TcII of 40%, 17.1%, and 14.3%, respectively. Additionally, they found two patients infected by TcV and one patient coinfected by TcIII+TcVI. These last three patients were in stage A of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy and were born at the Bahia State, in the northeast region of Brazil. When the T. cruzi genotypes were compared with the parasite load, more elevated parasite loads were observed in patients infected by TcII in general (median of 7.56 par. Eq./mL) in comparison to patients infected by TcVI (median of 2.35 par. Eq./mL). However, while the frequency of chagasic cardiomyopathy was 50% in patients infected by TcVI and TcV, only 16.7% of patients infected by TcII evolved to chagasic cardiomyopathy. Taking all the results together, the researchers concluded that their findings contribute to updating the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and highlight the importance of the age of the patient and infection by TcII as factors leading to the observation of higher parasitemia levels.
Rabies in bats is present in Guatemala, but we know very little about it. To find out more, we took samples from bats and tested for rabies. We found that rabies was present in two types of bats (Desmodus rotundus) and that the virus was found in their brains, mouth swabs, lungs, and kidneys. The virus was also found in the blood of one bat. We also found a non-synonymous substitution in the genetic material of the virus. We know that rabies in bats can be transmitted to humans and dogs, but we did not find any evidence of this in Guatemala. However, we think that rabies in bats could pose a risk to humans and animals in the future, so it is important to continue to study it.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA replicates and expresses its genes inside a cell's nucleus. During the first hours of HSV infection, viral DNA forms a separate compartment inside the nucleus that is separated from the rest of the DNA in the cell. This compartment is called a "replication compartment," and it is where HSV DNA is actively replicated and expressed. A protein called lamin A/C is thought to help form this compartment and to help keep the viral DNA separate from the rest of the cell's DNA. However, the role of lamin A/C in HSV infection is not well understood. In this study, researchers used mice that were missing the gene for lamin A/C to investigate how this protein affects HSV infection. They found that in these mice, the replication compartment formed by HSV DNA was smaller than normal and did not form at the correct location inside the nucleus. The researchers also found that there was more "heterochromatin" (a type of DNA packaging that helps keep genes turned off) associated with the viral DNA in the mice that were missing lamin A/C. This suggests that lamin A/C may be involved in helping to turn off certain genes that are associated with HSV infection. Overall, this study provides new insights into how lamin A/C may play a role in HSV infection.
Mitochondria are organelles found in almost all eukaryotic cells that produce energy for the cell. They were originally bacteria that got taken into a cell and reprogrammed to work for the cell instead of itself. The protein import machinery that helps proteins get into the mitochondria has been studied for a while, but there is still much to learn about it. One type of mitochondrion that is especially interesting is called a hydrogenosome. These are found in certain organisms that don't use oxygen to make energy. The proteins that make up the protein import machinery in these organisms are very different from the ones in regular mitochondria. In this study, researchers looked at the protein import machinery in hydrogenosomes from a type of parasite called Trichomonas vaginalis. They found that the machinery is composed of three different types of proteins that are all very different from the ones found in regular mitochondria. These proteins are able to help proteins get into the hydrogenosomes, just like the protein import machinery in regular mitochondria does. The researchers also looked at the way that these proteins are put together and found that they form a skull-like shape. Overall, this study is important because it helps us understand how protein import machinery works in different types of organelles.
Researchers have found that certain genetic variations may be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. To better understand how these genetic variations affect the immune system, researchers isolated T cells (a type of immune cell) from the blood of 313 healthy individuals. They then analyzed the genetic variations that were associated with changes in gene expression in these cells. The researchers found that some genetic variations only affected gene expression in certain types of T cells, such as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. They also found that some genetic variations were associated with changes in protein production or isoform levels (different versions of the same gene) in T cells. The researchers believe that this study will help them to better understand how genetic variations affect the immune system and how they contribute to autoimmune diseases.
In this study, the authors explored the barriers that prevent people from participating in screening and treatment for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The authors conducted interviews with current and former HAT patients, as well as healthcare providers and program managers of the national HAT control program, to understand the community's perspective. They discovered that people believed that observing six-month prohibitions after HAT treatment, such as no work, no sexual intercourse, no hot food, and no walking in the sun, caused serious complications. These prohibitions were well-known in the community and led some people to avoid HAT screening campaigns. However, the authors found that these prohibitions were not evidence-based and became obsolete with the new safer drugs. The authors emphasized the importance of correct health information for healthcare providers to address the community's perspective and keep abreast of unintended transformations of meaning in the context of HAT treatment.
Médecins Sans Frontières has worked to diagnose and treat patients with visceral leishmaniasis in Tabarak Allah Hospital in Sudan since December 2009. To estimate the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis in villages around the hospital, a survey was conducted from May to June 2011. The survey included 45 villages in Al-Gureisha locality, and a total of 17,702 households were interviewed. The crude mortality rate over the mean recall period of 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people per day. Visceral leishmaniasis was a possible or probable cause of death for 19% of all deaths. The survey estimated the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis over the past year at 7.0/1000 persons per year, or 7.9/1000 when deaths possibly or probably due to visceral leishmaniasis were included. The proportion of the population treated for visceral leishmaniasis in the past was 12.5%. The proportion of PKDL among patients previously treated for visceral leishmaniasis was 11.9%. The study concluded that visceral leishmaniasis is a significant health burden in eastern Gedaref State. Active visceral leishmaniasis case detection had a very low yield in this specific setting with adequate access to care and may not be the priority intervention to enhance control in similar contexts. The study emphasized the need for a combination of early detection, treatment, and indoor residual spraying for effective control of visceral leishmaniasis.
Supercoiling in bacterial DNA is produced by gyrase, which is composed of two types of proteins called GyrA and GyrB. These proteins form an A2B2 tetramer. The supercoiling of DNA has a major impact on the efficiency and phenotype of many proteins involved in DNA replication, chromosome segregation, RNA transcription, and recombination. It is known that supercoiling increases the efficiency of resolution of a site-specific recombination system called γδ in bacteria. This system uses supercoil diffusion to drive the assembly of a precise synapse of repeating sequences. However, supercoiling at multiple locations in the chromosome is difficult to analyze using classical techniques. To measure supercoiling at multiple locations, a 9 kb module called a "supercoil sensor" was developed. It contains an entire Lac operon plus a selectable gentamycin resistance gene flanked by repeating sequences. The sensor can measure resolution efficiency at multiple locations in the chromosome. The authors found that highly expressed genes, like the rrnG operon, act as barriers to supercoil diffusion in the chromosome. When the supercoiling of the rrnG operon was measured in strains with mutations in topoisomerase I and gyrase, it was found that the supercoiling differential increased in regions flanking the rrnG operon. The authors propose a model that RNA polymerase generates two supercoiling domains during transcription. This model suggests that highly expressed genes will have increased (−) supercoiling upstream and decreased (−) supercoiling downstream. The authors tested this model by placing a supercoil sensor upstream and downstream of the rrnG promoter and terminator. They found that the upstream sensor had a higher resolution efficiency than the downstream sensor, confirming the twin domain model. The authors suggest that local supercoiling levels can change dramatically at opposite ends of a highly transcribed operon in cells growing at permissive temperatures. They also found that temperature sensitive mutations in gyrase and topoisomerase I and IV caused significant changes in genome-wide negative supercoil levels, even when cells were grown at a permissive temperature. They suggest that transcription plays a causal role in the supercoil losses because supercoiling rebounded after addition of rifampicin, which blocked transcription initiation. The authors propose a model that suggests that transcription kinetics determine the optimal catalytic speed for gyrase, and the average chromosome supercoil density is an integral function of topoisomerases and RNA polymerase working together.
The human genetic disorder Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is caused by mutations in the LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator) gene, which encodes a large cytosolic protein involved in regulating the size of lysosomes and related organelles. LYST/Beige expression is upregulated in CHS patient cells and in beige mouse cells, which lack functional LYST/Beige. LYST/Beige overexpression reduces lysosome size. LYS/Beige may also be involved in regulating the size of other organelles such as late endosomes. LYS/Beige regulates the size of organelles by influencing the activities of kinases and other molecules involved in membrane fusion and fission. LYS/Beige appears to be important for controlling the intracellular growth of Leishmania amazonensis, a parasite causing cutaneous leishmaniasis in the new world. L. amazonensis replicates within very large PVs (parasitophorous vacuoles) in CHS patient cells and in beige mouse cells, when compared to the small PVs found in LYS/Beige-expressing cells. The upregulation of LYS/Beige expression during L. amazonensis infection suggests that LYS/Beige may be involved in controlling the growth of L. amazonensis by inhibiting PV expansion.
The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a rare genetic condition that results in severe mental retardation, muscle weakness, spasticity, and speech impairment. It is caused by mutations in the MCT8 gene, which encodes a protein that transports thyroid hormones into cells. To understand the underlying mechanism of AHDS, researchers have used gene-editing techniques to create MCT8-deficient zebrafish. These fish show behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered sleep patterns, and impaired responses to light and dark transitions. They also exhibit changes in the expression of genes related to myelination, the process of forming the protective insulating layer around nerve fibers. Furthermore, researchers have found that certain thyroid hormone analogs can partially reverse the behavioral and myelin-related deficiencies in MCT8-deficient zebrafish. These findings suggest that these hormone analogs may be useful for treating AHDS patients.
This paper describes experiments that show that the HCMV gB and gH/gL proteins interact with each other even when gB cannot fuse membranes together. The authors conducted experiments using cell-cell fusion assays and found that gBA154W and gBW240A, two mutant versions of HCMV gB, did not promote cell-cell fusion. However, these mutants still formed complexes with gH/gL. The authors also found that a third mutant version of HCMV gB, gBΔCT, which lacks the entire cytoplasmic domain of gB, also interacted with gH/gL. These results indicate that gB-gH/gL complexes form even when gB is not capable of fusion, and they support the hypothesis that stable gB-gH/gL complexes are present in the virion envelope and may initiate membrane fusion.
The study investigates how certain genes regulate the segregation of different mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in different tissues. Previous research has shown that certain mtDNA mutations, such as the A3243G mutation, can have different effects on tissues depending on the mutation and tissue. To understand the mechanisms behind this tissue-specific segregation, researchers used a heteroplasmic mouse model with two neutral mtDNA haplotypes derived from two inbred mouse strains. These haplotypes have different preferences for certain tissues. For example, in hematopoietic tissues, the BALB haplotype is preferred over the NZB haplotype, while in the kidney and liver, the NZB haplotype is preferred. The researchers showed that nuclear-encoded genes regulate this segregation process and mapped the quantitative trait loci involved. They also found that certain nuclear backgrounds can completely eliminate the selection for the BALB haplotype in hematopoietic tissues. In this study, the researchers investigated the role of Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, in regulating mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues. They showed that Gimap3 is a critical regulator of this process. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms behind tissue-specific segregation of mtDNA mutations.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a disease caused by bacteria that can cause skin and soft tissue infections. The bacteria are found in the environment, and it is not known exactly how people get infected. However, it is known that the primary risk factor for getting BU is living or traveling in an area where BU is endemic. In the state of Victoria, Australia, most people who get BU are visitors to these areas. A study was done to estimate the incubation period (the time between exposure to an area where BU is endemic and when the first symptoms appear) for BU. Previous estimates of the incubation period have varied widely, from a few weeks to over 5 months. The study looked at 443 cases of BU notified in Victoria between 2013 and 2016. Interviews were conducted with people who had a single visit to an area where BU is endemic or multiple visits within a one-month period. The mean incubation period for these people was 143 days, or about 4.8 months. This is very similar to the previous estimate of 135 days (4.5 months). Despite the predominant exposure location shifting from the Bellarina peninsula to the Mornington peninsula, the study found no association between incubation period and other factors such as age, sex, location of exposure, duration of exposure to an endemic area, or location of the BU lesion. This suggests that the mode of transmission of BU is similar in different geographic regions in Victoria. The knowledge of the mean incubation period of BU in Victoria is important for clinicians and public health officials to understand the disease better.
Toxoplasma, a parasite that lives inside of other cells, has a protein called TgNCR1 that is closely related to a human protein called NPC1. TgNCR1 is involved in the movement of cholesterol and other lipids within the parasite, and mutant parasites that lack this protein have abnormal amounts of certain lipids and can replicate more quickly. This suggests that TgNCR1 plays a key role in regulating lipids in the parasite, and that the parasite needs TgNCR1 to grow and survive.
The paper is about a disorder called Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), which is characterized by the combination of eye malformations, most commonly bilateral anophthalmia (the absence of the eyes), with post-axial oligosyndactyly (having fewer than five fingers on the hands or toes on the feet). The authors report on the identification of a locus on 14q24.2 for OAS with subsequent identification of homozygous, predicted loss-of-function mutations in the SMOC1 gene in eight out of fourteen unrelated families with OAS. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) combined with optical projection tomography (OPT) shows site- and stage-specific developmental expression of the orthologous mouse gene, Smoc1, in embryonic limb bud and craniofacial structures. The authors also discuss the potential role of SMOC-1 in modulating BMP signaling during eye and limb development.
In this study, the authors investigated how Type 1 interferons, which are part of the immune system and produced by many cell types, block HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) replication. They discovered that a protein called TRIM22 plays a key role in this process. They used transcriptional profiling to find out which cellular genes were induced by interferon treatment and found TRIM22 to be one of the most strongly up-regulated genes. They then confirmed that over-expression of TRIM22 inhibited HIV replication. To study the role of TRIM22 expressed under natural inducing conditions, they compared the effects of interferon in cells depleted for TRIM22 using RNAi (RNA interference) and found that HIV particle release was significantly increased in the knockdown, indicating that TRIM22 acts as a natural antiviral effector. They then studied how TRIM22 inhibited HIV replication and found that it blocked the release of HIV Gag particles. They also found that the RING domain of TRIM22 was required for its antiviral activity. The authors' findings provide new insights into how Type 1 interferons block HIV replication.
The fig-pollinator mutualism is a fascinating example of how cooperation can be sustained in the face of competition. By pollinating fig trees, wasps help disperse their pollen and promote seed production, while the trees provide resources for the wasps. However, the wasps are not passive pollinators, as they also parasitize the figs by laying eggs inside the ovules, which then develop into galls. A recent study has shown that parasitism pressure is not only a factor that affects the fitness of foundresses, but it also plays a role in the stability of the mutualism. The study found that parasitic wasps are more likely to attack inner ovules, which have a higher profitability to foundresses because they are less vulnerable to parasitism. This is due to the spatial segregation of parasites, pollinators, and seeds within the figs, which favors the development of galls in the inner ovules. The study also found that parasitic wasps contribute to the overall mechanisms that enable the mutualism to remain stable across Ficus species. This highlights the importance of considering multiple factors in understanding the stability of ecological interactions, especially those involving parasitism.
Plants grow differently depending on their genes and the environment they are in. Water, space, and time all affect how tall they will be. Researchers studied a type of grass plant called Setaria to learn more about how these factors affect plant height. They found that height is a complex trait that is influenced by multiple genes and can change depending on the environment. The researchers discovered that the genes that affect height in Setaria are different from the ones that affect height in other grasses. They also found that the effects of the genes that affect height are different at different times of plant development. These results show that researchers can better understand how to control plant height by studying how genes and the environment interact to affect plant growth.
The study aimed to confirm the circulation of Ilheus virus (ILHV) in the Pantanal wetlands of Brazil. ILHV is a virus that can cause encephalitis in humans, but is usually spread through zoonotic cycles between birds and mosquitoes. A total of 3234 mosquitoes were collected from the Nhecolândia sub-region of the Pantanal in 2009 and 2010. The mosquitoes were tested for ILHV RNA and virus isolation. ILHV RNA was detected in one pool of 50 non-engorged female mosquitoes of Aedes scapularis, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1000 mosquitoes. Full-length genomic sequence of the virus was obtained and found to have 95% identity to the only full genome sequence available for ILHV. This study confirms the circulation of ILHV in the Brazilian Pantanal.
Scabies is a common dermatological condition that is largely ignored as a public health issue. However, it can cause notable morbidity, especially in vulnerable populations, such as young children, Aboriginals in Northern Australia, and Fiji islands. Additionally, scabies outbreaks are common in institutions, underprivileged populations, and immunocompromised individuals. There are currently limited treatments for scabies, and the few available drugs, such as permethrin, benzyl benzoate, crotamiton, and malathion, are mostly topical agents. Ivermectin (IVM) is the only oral drug available for scabies. However, it has a short half-life and requires multiple treatments. In addition, there have been reports of resistance to IVM and permethrin, making it even more difficult to treat scabies. Moxidectin (MOX) is another macrocyclic lactone that has better pharmaco- and toxicokinetic profiles compared to IVM. A preclinical study was conducted to establish the efficacy, toxicity, and pharmacokinetics of MOX compared to IVM. The study used a porcine scabies model developed by Mounsey et al. In this study, 12 pigs were randomly assigned to receive either MOX (0.3 mg/kg once) or IVM (0.2 mg/kg twice) or no treatment. Efficacy was determined by assessing mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies. The study found that MOX was more effective than IVM, with 100% efficacy compared to 62% for IVM. In addition, MOX persisted in the plasma and skin for a longer time, enabling long-lasting efficacy. The study suggests that MOX may be a potential therapeutic approach for scabies.
The paper "Identification of the Minimal Protein Composition of the Bacterial Peptidoglycan Synthesis Machine" by Rodriguez-Rubio et al. is about the study of how a particular kind of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus makes a substance called peptidoglycan (PG), which is important for the structure of the bacteria's cell wall. The researchers wanted to understand more about how PG is made, so they tried to figure out what proteins are needed for this process to happen. They deleted genes from the S. aureus genome that encode proteins involved in PG synthesis, and then tested how the bacteria grew and functioned. They found that the bacteria could still make PG with just two proteins, PBP1 and bi-functional PBP2, which are involved in the last stages of PG synthesis. However, these bacteria were less able to fight off antibiotics and other threats, and were also less able to infect flies. This study shows that even though some proteins may not be essential for the basic function of the PG synthesis machine, they are still important for the bacteria to survive and cause infections in natural environments like a host.
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a bacterium that can cause a disease called melioidosis in humans. It can also survive in soil and water. To grow, B . pseudomallei needs iron, which is available in very low amounts in soil, water, and even in the blood of animals and people. To get enough iron, B . pseudomallei uses different ways to get it from its environment. These ways include using a type of iron-binding molecule called a siderophore and taking in heme from blood. Researchers have found that a bacterial gene called mba is responsible for making a type of siderophore called malleobactin, which helps B . pseudomallei get the iron it needs to survive. They have also found that another type of siderophore called pyochelin is made by a different gene called pch. The researchers made mutant versions of the bacteria that could not make these siderophores. They found that these mutant versions were still able to survive and cause disease in animals. This means that the bacteria do not need the siderophores to cause disease, and that there may be other ways for them to get the iron they need. The researchers also found that the bacteria need another gene called hmu to be able to take in iron from hemoglobin, which is a protein found in blood that carries oxygen. They also found that the bacteria need another gene called hem to be able to take in iron from heme, which is a protein found in blood that carries oxygen. The researchers made mutant versions of the bacteria that could not use these genes. They found that these mutant versions were able to survive and cause disease in animals, which means that the bacteria do not need these genes to cause disease, and that there may be other ways for them to get the iron they need. The researchers also found that the bacteria can also use a type of iron that is found in ferritin, another protein found in blood that carries oxygen. This means that the bacteria may have a new way to get the iron they need to survive and cause disease.
Metabolic models are important in understanding how organisms function. However, they often contain inconsistencies and errors. COMMGEN is a tool that can automatically identify these inconsistencies and generate consensus metabolic models. These consensus models are more consistent and accurate than individual models, and they can be used in a variety of metabolic simulations. The authors tested COMMGEN on four different organisms and showed that the generated consensus models were more consistent and accurate than individual models. They also showed that the consensus models retained their predictive capabilities. Overall, COMMGEN is a valuable tool for generating more comprehensive and accurate metabolic models.
In this study, we found that certain proteins called proteoglycans (PGs) in cartilage help regulate the timing of bone growth. To do this, we used zebrafish mutants to study how PGs affect interactions between chondrocytes (cells that make up cartilage) and other cells around them. We found that when we mutate genes that make these PGs, chondrocytes start to make bone instead of cartilage. This happens because the chondrocytes start to mature too early, which leads to bone growth happening too soon. We then used various techniques to show that these mutant chondrocytes are behaving in a way that makes them look like they're starting to make bone, even though they're still supposed to be making cartilage. This means that the mutant chondrocytes are maturing too early, which is why bone growth happens too soon. We also studied how these mutations affect other cells around the chondrocytes, like the perichondrium, which is a thin layer of cells that surrounds the developing cartilage. We found that these mutations also affect how these perichondrial cells behave, which helps explain how the mutant chondrocytes start to make bone too soon. Overall, our study suggests that certain proteins called proteoglycans are important for regulating the timing of bone growth, and that mutations in genes that make these proteins can cause bone growth to happen too soon.
This study looked at how a specific type of DNA, called heterochromatin, is separated during meiosis in fruit flies. The researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the levels of a protein called Topoisomerase II, which helps separate DNA. They found that when Topoisomerase II levels are knocked down, heterochromatic regions do not separate as well during meiosis and the fruit flies have trouble completing their meiosis. This study shows that Topoisomerase II plays an important role in separating heterochromatin during meiosis in fruit flies.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a serious and deadly disease spread by sand flies that affects humans and dogs. The current control measures are ineffective and expensive, which is why researchers are testing an alternative approach. They tested a collar that is impregnated with a chemical repellent and placed it on dogs to protect them from being bitten by sand flies. The collar was found to be effective in reducing the risk of getting VL in dogs.
The study investigates the hypothesis that the X chromosome's unusual gene content is shaped by limits imposed on gene expression due to the X chromosome's haploid expression. The study uses data from the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project and The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) to test this hypothesis. The study finds that the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is much lower than that of genes on autosomes. The study also finds that autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. The study concludes that the traffic jam model provides a simple and robustly supported rationale for many peculiar features of X's gene content, gene expression, and evolution.
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that infects the stomach lining of humans. It was first discovered in the 1980s in patients with gastric ulcers. Since then, it has become clear that almost everyone in the world is infected with this bacteria, and that the infection is often asymptomatic. The bacterium has been found in three different African populations and one European population. These populations are called hpAfrica2, hpNEAfrica, hpAfrica1, and hpEurasia. The study discussed in this article focused on the H. pylori populations found in two populations of Baka Pygmies in Cameroon. The authors found that the prevalence of H. pylori in the Baka was much lower than in their neighboring non-Baka agriculturalist populations, and that the H. pylori population in the Baka did not define a new lineage. This suggests that the Baka acquired their H. pylori from their agriculturalist neighbors. The authors also used genetic analysis to determine the age of the H. pylori lineage in the Baka. They found that the lineage was relatively recent and had been acquired by the Baka after their contact with the agriculturalist populations. This study provides important information about the spread of H. pylori in different human populations, and highlights the role of demographic factors such as population size and life expectancy in the eradication of the bacteria from certain populations.
Dengue virus NS5 is a key protein for virus replication. It has been shown to localize to the nucleus or cytoplasm depending on the serotype. In this study, researchers used a combination of functional and structural analyses to determine the region responsible for this localization difference. They found that the C-terminal 18 residues (Cter18) alone were sufficient to direct the protein to the nucleus or cytoplasm. The researchers then used X-ray crystallography and mutational analysis to identify residues important for NS5 subcellular localization. They found that the Cter18 region plays a crucial role in RNA interactions, which are critical for replication. They also found that mutating a proline residue in DENV1 NS5 to a threonine led to mislocalization of NS5 to the cytoplasm, while a mutation to alanine in a conserved residue led to a completely non-viable virus. These findings suggest that the NS5 Cter18 region has an evolutionarily conserved function that is important for replication and pathogenesis.
The paper describes a new methodology to map neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in a way that saves resources by identifying populations that need treatment. The methodology, called Integrated Threshold Mapping (ITM) Methodology, is designed to be efficient and to determine whether a disease has reached a threshold for public health intervention. The ITM methodology relies on the World Health Organization's recommended indicators for each disease in specific age groups, and uses a district or sub-district as the sampling frame for each disease. The methodology was tested in one district each in Mali and Senegal and found to reach the same conclusions as the standard WHO methodologies regarding the initiation of public health interventions for trachoma, LF, and STH. However, the ITM methodology resulted in more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. The methodology was found to be practical, feasible and demonstrated an overall cost saving compared with the standard, non-integrated, WHO methodologies. The paper concludes that the ITM methodology could facilitate the implementation of programs in endemic countries.
The paper describes the process of releasing a protein called Cdc14 from the nucleolus during anaphase of the cell cycle. This protein is essential for exiting mitosis. Two mechanisms, the FEAR (Cdc14 early anaphase release) network and the MEN (mitotic exit network), are known to promote Cdc14 release. The paper presents new evidence that the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase is required for Cdc14 release during early anaphase, when the MEN is inactive. This function is mediated by the activation of histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (meH3K4 and meH3K79) by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase. The paper also suggests that this function for H3 methylation is not dependent on the histone deacetylase Sir2, which is part of the RENT (regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase exit) complex. Additionally, the paper shows that the process is not due to aberrant regulation of known FEAR network components and can be extended to other histone modifications.
We present a novel computational methodology, GeneProgram, designed to analyze large compendia of human gene expression data. The algorithm simultaneously compresses sets of genes into expression programs and sets of tissues into groups. GeneProgram addresses challenges arising from tissue inhomogeneity, patchy origin of samples, and uncertainty in the number of tissue groups and expression programs. The algorithm infers a set of biologically interpretable expression programs and automatically discovers coherent tissue groups. GeneProgram has revealed a large number of expression programs involved in key signaling pathways and bound by NF-κB transcription factor family members.
The study explores the mechanisms underlying IFN-gamma expression in memory-like features of NK cells. The authors show that only NKG2C-expressing NK cells undergo epigenetic remodeling of the IFNG locus, which leads to enhanced and stable IFN-gamma expression. The study provides a molecular basis for the regulation of adaptive features in innate cells, such as NK cells, and highlights the role of epigenetic mechanisms in controlling IFN-gamma expression.
Pathogen-associated secretion systems are used by bacteria to enter and manipulate host cells. Legionella LubX protein is an effector that works as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to regulate the function of another effector, SidH, within the host cell. The regulation of these effectors by LubX occurs through a process called spatiotemporal control, which involves the delivery of the LubX protein to the host cytoplasm at different stages of infection. The regulation of these effectors by LubX is an example of the complex ways that bacteria and host cells interact and coevolve during infection.
HIV-1 is a virus that changes quickly when it infects a new person. In this study, researchers analyzed how quickly HIV-1 changed in 81 people who were recently infected with the virus. By comparing the viruses in these people to the viruses that infected them, the researchers could see which parts of the virus changed most quickly. They found that certain parts of the virus changed more quickly than others. In some cases, the virus seemed to be changing in a way that made it harder for the body's immune system to recognize it. The researchers also looked at how the virus changed in terms of its size. They found that the virus seemed to be changing its size in a way that made it more difficult for the body's immune system to recognize it. Overall, the study provides important information about how HIV-1 changes when it infects a new person and how it evolves to escape the body's immune system.
Our study aims to understand the silencing mechanism of yeast's heterochromatin, which regulates gene expression. To do this, we developed a computer model that incorporates known molecular interactions in the system, focusing on the epigenetic marks H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation. Our model reveals that having both marks is important for robustness of the silencing system. The model also shows that the presence of multiple marks can lead to bivalent states, where some chromatin regions have both active and silencing marks. This is important for understanding the controversial role of Dot1, which methylates H3K79. Finally, the model helps us understand why Sir protein recruitment, spreading and stability of silenced regions in mutants all play important roles in the yeast silencing system.
Malnutrition is a major issue in developing countries and affects many children. Malnutrition can be divided into two types: oedematous and non-oedematous. Oedematous malnutrition is characterized by swelling and can be life-threatening in its most severe form, kwashiorkor. The causes of oedematous malnutrition are not fully understood, but it has been linked to gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis. In this study, the researchers compared the GM of Ugandan children with oedematous and non-oedematous malnutrition. The children were hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition aged 6-24 months. Fecal samples were collected at admission, and the researchers used various techniques to analyze the GM composition. They found that non-oedematous malnutrition children had lower GM diversity compared to oedematous malnutrition children, but there were no clear differences in GM composition between the two groups.
The length of telomeres in yeast varies among individuals and is controlled by multiple loci. In a study, researchers screened 112 wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates and found extensive telomere length variation in S. paradoxus isolates. The length of telomeres varies depending on the geographic origin of the isolates, with European strains having extremely short telomeres and American isolates having telomeres approximately three times as long. The study also found variation in telomere position effect (TPE) which is weakly correlated with telomere length. Researchers also identified several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with telomere length and silencing variation. They validated their findings by reciprocal hemizygosity and suggested that sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer generates negative epistasis within one of the allelic combinations. Overall, this study provides insights into the complex genetic mechanisms underlying telomere length variation in yeast.
Many decisions are made based on multiple pieces of information that are gathered over time. This type of decision-making process is not directly observable, but can significantly affect behavior. To capture this process, researchers use a model called a sequential sampling model (SSM), which assumes that decisions are made after an evidence accumulation process that lasts until a certain threshold is reached. However, the standard SSM does not account for the possibility that people may choose not to decide and may delay their responses. In a recent study, researchers used EEG and fMRI to investigate value-based decision-making in the brain. Participants were asked to buy or reject stocks based on probabilistic information sampled sequentially, and were free to make their decision at any time. The researchers developed an SSM variant that accurately predicted which choice was made and how many ratings were sampled. However, the model did not specify the exact timing of the decision. To address this issue, the researchers proposed a new SSM that allows for the possibility of a decision not to decide, which can temporarily stop the accumulation process. They supported this model with evidence from time-frequency analysis of the EEG data, which showed that the decision not to decide was accompanied by an increase in beta-band oscillatory power, indicating active inhibition of motor responses. Finally, the researchers tested their model experimentally by adapting the task so that the decision to sample more information was explicit, and found that the new SSM accurately predicted the data.
Hereditary Nasal Parakeratosis (HNPK) is a genetic condition that affects the skin of Labrador Retrievers, causing crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using 13 cases and 23 controls. The analysis identified a single strong association signal on chromosome 2. By sequencing the genome of one case at 38× coverage, three non-synonymous variants in the critical interval were identified. Only one variant was perfectly associated with the HNPK phenotype in a larger cohort of dogs. This variant is a missense mutation in the SUV39H2 gene, which encodes a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase that mediates chromatin silencing. The variant is predicted to change an evolutionary conserved asparagine into a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme. The authors studied the histopathological alterations in the epidermis in vivo and found that the HNPK phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation but rather delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. This study provides evidence that SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and tight sealing of the mammalian epidermis.
Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are contagious viruses that infect many different animals, including humans. These viruses are divided into different subtypes based on their surface proteins. Researchers have found that swine have both avian and human-like receptors on their respiratory tissue cells, making them a possible "mixing vessel" for creating new subtypes of IAVs through genetic reassortments with avian and human IAVs. However, it is not clear how a transmissible reassortant virus emerges in swine. In this study, the authors analyzed 571 IAV samples taken from the nasal passages and respiratory tissues of a group of feral swine that were co-infected with avian and swine IAVs. They found 30 distinct genotypes of reassortant viruses and identified the ones that were transmissible between pigs. The authors also determined the locations where these reassortant viruses were most likely to be found and how they grew in different types of respiratory tissue cells. Their findings suggest that the tissue tropism, or preference for growing in certain types of cells, is an important factor in selecting for a transmissible reassortant virus.
The study investigates whether maternal schistosomiasis infection and its treatment during pregnancy can influence the immune response of children when they are exposed to the same parasite later in life. The study involved offspring of 1343 women who were infected with the schistosome worm (S. mansoni) during pregnancy. The study found that the offspring of women who received praziquantel treatment during pregnancy had a higher IL-10 response to SWA, indicating that maternal schistosomiasis and its treatment during pregnancy may affect the development of immunoregulatory responses in childhood schistosomiasis.
Macrophages play a key role in fighting infections, but they can become overwhelmed and not be able to destroy enough pathogens to stop an infection. In this study, the authors found that when macrophages are exposed to certain stimuli, they change the way they take in material from their surroundings. Instead of taking in material through a process called receptor-mediated phagocytosis, where the material is brought in using specific receptors, the macrophages take in large amounts of material through a process called macropinocytosis. The authors found that this change in behavior is caused by a protein called coronin 1 being phosphorylated by a protein kinase called protein kinase C. This phosphorylation causes coronin 1 to relocate within the macrophage cell and switch the internalization process from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis. This change allows macrophages to take in and destroy large amounts of material more efficiently.
This study assessed community knowledge and perceptions of tsetse baits (traps, targets) in villages where they had or had not been used previously in Uganda. The study found that while villages in close proximity had different perceptions of tsetse baits, villagers who had never seen traps before expressed fear and anxiety when they first encountered them. This was related to traditional beliefs that associated tsetse flies with physical or mental illness, death, and misfortune. By contrast, villagers living in areas where traps had been used previously had positive attitudes towards them and were fully aware of their purpose and benefits. The success of community-based tsetse control interventions therefore depends on early engagements with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns that reach all communities.
Researchers have created the first detailed map of recombination events across the entire genome of Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly species. They used high-resolution genetic mapping techniques to detect over 106,000 recombination events, with a median distance of less than 2 kilobases between each event and the nearest informative single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). This is a significant improvement over previous genetic maps, which had much lower resolution and were based on fewer recombination events. The researchers also distinguished between two types of recombination events: crossing over and gene conversion. Crossing over is a process in which a strand of DNA from one parent is swapped with a strand of DNA from the other parent, while gene conversion is a process in which a small section of DNA is swapped between parents. The researchers found that recombination events occur at different rates across the genome and within the population of Drosophila melanogaster. They also observed significant intra-specific variation in recombination rates and landscapes, which may have important implications for the evolution of this species.
In this article, the authors identify the component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in Arabidopsis thaliana. They use affinity purification to purify the component and then use it to identify other components of the RdDM machinery. They also determine the function of each component by introducing them into a mutant plant and observing the effect on the RdDM machinery. They show that the previously uncharacterized XH domain of IDN2 is required for the formation of the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex, which is required for the RdDM machinery to function properly. They also show that IDP1 is required for de novo DNA methylation and transcriptional gene silencing, while IDP2 has partially overlapping roles with IDP1.
Neutrophils are the body's first line of defense against invading pathogens. When Leishmania parasites invade a body, neutrophils are quickly recruited to the site of infection. In this study, we investigated how neutrophils respond to Leishmania braziliensis infection. We found that exposure of neutrophils to Leishmania parasites led to their activation and release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and neutrophil elastase. We also observed that neutrophils infected with Leishmania parasites displayed early markers of apoptosis. Overall, our study suggests that neutrophils play an important role in the early stages of Leishmania braziliensis infection.
This paper explores the potential of vaccination to help control bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle using a mathematical model. Currently, vaccination against bTB is not used in any international control program, and it is illegal in the EU. However, researchers are developing new diagnostic tests that can differentiate between vaccinated and infected animals. These diagnostic tests, called DIVA tests, could be used in combination with vaccination. The paper uses a mathematical model to explore how different DIVA tests could impact the use of vaccination in bTB control. The authors find that the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than its sensitivity, is the most important factor in determining whether vaccination can provide a protective economic benefit at the herd level. They also find that DIVA test characteristics can be optimized to achieve this. The authors suggest that the EU could consider relaxing testing requirements to mitigate the negative economic impact of DIVA testing.
Trichuriasis is a parasitic infection caused by a whipworm called Trichuris trichiura that affects around 500 million people worldwide. The most common drugs used to treat trichuriasis are albendazole and mebendazole, but they are not effective against all types of Trichuris. Scientists have been looking for new drugs to treat trichuriasis. Using a lab model of Trichuris muris, a type of whipworm, scientists screened 480 drugs and found a new class of molecules that paralyze the adult parasite. These molecules, called dihydrobenzoxazepinones, also reduce the ability of the eggs to infect a host. These findings suggest that the dihydrobenzoxazepinones could be used as new drugs to treat trichuriasis.
This study challenges the idea that hubs in protein–protein interaction networks can be categorized into two distinct groups based on their co-expression patterns. The study found that the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of these hubs, and that these few extremely central hubs do not display particularly low expression correlation. The previous study by Han et al. proposed that date hubs are global connectors while party hubs are local coordinators. However, this distinction was based on an approximately bimodal distribution of hub co-expression which the study shows is not always robust to methodological changes. The study also suggests that thinking in terms of a date/party dichotomy for hubs in protein interaction networks is not meaningful, and it might be more useful to conceive of roles for protein-protein interactions rather than for individual proteins. The study also shows that there is little correlation between interaction centrality and the functional similarity of the interacting proteins. Instead, it suggests thinking about topological roles in networks by defining measures on links rather than on nodes. The study examines the properties of yeast and human interaction networks and finds that the observed differences in network vulnerability to attacks on the two hub types seem to arise from only a small number of particularly important hubs. The study also shows that a detailed analysis of network topology, employing the novel perspective of community structure and the roles of hubs within this context, suggests that the picture is more complicated than a simple dichotomy. Proteins in the interactome show a variety of topological characteristics that appear to lie along a continuum and there does not exist a clear correlation between their location on this continuum and the avPCC of expression of their interaction partners. On the other hand, investigating link (interaction) betweenness centralities reveals an interesting relation to the functional linkage of proteins, suggesting that a framework incorporating a more nuanced notion of roles for both nodes and links might provide a better framework for understanding the organization of the interactome.
This study introduces the concept of "transmission divergence," which is the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs. The authors simulate outbreak scenarios alongside sequence evolution using two models described in the literature to describe transmission divergence of ten major outbreak-causing pathogens. They find that while mean values vary significantly between the pathogens considered, their transmission divergence is generally very low, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. The authors describe the impact of transmission divergence on the ability to reconstruct outbreaks using two outbreak reconstruction tools, the R packages outbreaker and phybreak. They demonstrate that genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses can provide valuable information on individual transmission events, while sequence data of pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information about individual transmission events. The authors highlight the informational limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak scenarios and demonstrate the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data.
In mammals, there are two X chromosomes in females and only one in males. To make sure that females have the same number of chromosomes as males, one of the X chromosomes is randomly turned off (inactivated) in females. However, not all genes on the X chromosome are turned off. In this study, the authors used RNA-seq to measure the levels of expression of genes on the X chromosome in different tissues in female mice. They also used RNA-seq to measure the levels of expression of the same genes in male mice. By comparing the levels of expression in males and females, the authors were able to determine which genes are turned off and which genes are still turned on (escaping inactivation). They also used a new method to analyze the data from RNA-seq and estimate the probability of a gene being turned on. The authors used this method to identify common genes that escape inactivation and tissue-specific genes that escape inactivation. They also used other techniques, such as RT-PCR, to confirm their results.
In this study, we found a new enzyme that is important for malaria parasite growth and survival. This enzyme is called "vivapain-4" (or VX-4) and is similar to other enzymes called "cysteine proteases" that have been found in other malaria parasites. These enzymes are used by the parasite to break down food and to break down structures in the cell. VX-4 is different from other cysteine proteases in that it has a unique ability to switch between two different ways of breaking down food depending on the pH (acidic or basic) of the environment. This may be important for the parasite to be able to survive and grow in different parts of the body, where the pH is different. VX-4 also has the ability to break down other enzymes, which could help the parasite to break down food more efficiently. This enzyme may be useful for treating malaria because it is important for the parasite to survive and grow.
Acetogens are bacteria that can use carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), or a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) called syngas to produce multi-carbon chemicals. These microorganisms are promising for alternative biotechnological production of commodity chemicals. However, their physiology and ability to accurately predict phenotypes are incomplete, hindering advanced design strategies. Therefore, a genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) was reconstructed for the model acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii. The ME-model represents the first of its kind for a Gram-positive bacterium and captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways as well as pathways to synthesis RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions, thus significantly broadening the scope and predictability. The model accurately predicted secretion of acetate, ethanol, and glycerol during changing carbon and metal availability and revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in this model acetogen. Furthermore, predicting overflow metabolism enables new design strategies such as glycerol formation as a novel product for C. ljungdahlii, thus broadening its metabolic capability. Predicting changing secretion rates based on different metal availability provides new knowledge about the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens and opens the window into fermentation optimization.
The article discusses the use of large panels of human osteoblasts (bone-building cells) to study the relationship between genetic variation and the expression of different isoforms of the same gene. The authors used these cells to perform a transcriptomic survey, which is similar to a study done on lymphoblastoid cells (immortalized immune cells) in the past. They found that genetic variants can be associated with changes in the expression of different isoforms of the same gene, and that some of these isoform variations are tissue-specific. This finding is important for understanding the genetic basis of diseases such as osteoporosis, which affects bone health. The authors compared their results with a previous study that looked at the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in lymphoblastoid cells. They also compared their results with a recent study that looked at the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in brain and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Finally, the authors selected one example of a gene with a novel isoform variation that may be important for bone biology to follow up with more detailed studies.
This study aimed to understand how maltotriose utilization evolved in a strain of Saccharomyces eubayanus that does not naturally utilize it. The study used a combination of mutagenesis and laboratory evolution to select for strains with improved maltotriose utilization. The researchers discovered a novel maltotriose transporter gene, SeMalT413, in one of the evolved strains, and they also found evidence for gene neofunctionalization through a mosaic structure of the gene, with parts of the gene coming from different sources. Overall, the study sheds light on the evolution of maltotriose utilization in Saccharomyces eubayanus and suggests that gene duplication and recombination events play a role in this process.
Influenza viruses cause significant morbidity and mortality every season. Different strains of influenza viruses have emerged throughout history with varying mortality impacts. There are different approaches to assessing the impact of influenza viruses on human death. However, it is difficult to predict the mortality burden of a new influenza virus at the early stage of infection. In this study, researchers found a positive correlation between the antigenic distance of influenza viruses and their mortality burden. The mortality burden can be estimated by predicting the antigenic distance between influenza A (H1N1) strains based on their HA sequences. This study provides a method to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus, which can help develop cost-effective control and intervention strategies.
The Asian soybean rust fungus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, causes severe soybean disease epidemics. It is an obligate biotrophic pathogen that interacts with its host plant using many small, secreted cysteine-rich proteins (SSCRPs). However, the roles of these SSCRPs are unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of one of these proteins, PpEC23, in suppressing plant immunity. We show that PpEC23 interacts with soybean transcription factor GmSPL12l and that soybean plants in which GmSPL12l is silenced have constitutively active immunity. This suggests that PpEC23 is able to suppress soybean immune responses and physically interact with soybean transcription factor GmSPL12l, a negative immune regulator.
Chlamydia trachomatis, a type of bacteria that causes sexually transmitted infections and respiratory diseases, invades cells to replicate and cause infections. The bacteria interact with cell surface receptors to attach and enter the cells. One such receptor is EphrinA2, which activates the PI3 kinase signaling pathway, which is necessary for efficient replication of Chlamydia. The bacteria internalize EphrinA2 along with its activation signal and keep it near the site of replication. If EphrinA2 is blocked or removed from the cell surface, Chlamydia cannot efficiently replicate and the infected cells are more likely to undergo apoptosis. Therefore, Chlamydia subverts EphrinA2 to promote its own replication and survival.
Dendritic trees are the extensions of neurons that receive signals from other neurons. Many studies have tried to understand the function of these active dendritic conductances. The authors propose a simpler hypothesis that explains the main function of these conductances: they increase the dynamic range of the neuron. The authors used a model to study the dendritic tree as an excitable system. They found that the system has a very large dynamic range, up to 50 dB. This means that the neuron can handle five orders of magnitude of stimulus intensity. This is much better than what was previously observed in other network topologies. The authors claim that this high dynamic range is due to the branching structure of the tree. They also observed that the neuron's transfer function does not need to be simply a saturating curve, but can also have a double-sigmoid behavior. The authors claim that this is because of the non-linear interactions among dendritic spikes. They also observed that dendritic spikes could be responsible for the double-sigmoid behavior of the transfer function. The authors claim that the only reason why neurons have active dendrites is because they need to work with a large stimulus range. This is because they have a large number of afferent synapses and large variability of input rates.
The study looks at how to use gene expression data from transcriptomics experiments to infer regulatory interactions and build models of gene regulation. However, commonly-made assumptions in this process are often not valid, leading to biased results. The authors used a combination of models and experiments to investigate the importance of these assumptions. They used a genetic circuit known as the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network to measure protein concentrations and global physiological effects in real-time. The results show that correcting for the bias of these assumptions improves the quality of the models inferred from the data. The authors also show that these improvements are expected to be stronger for systems where protein concentrations have longer half-lives or where global physiological effects vary more strongly across conditions. This approach is broadly applicable when using time-series transcriptome data to learn about the structure and dynamics of regulatory networks. In the case of the FliA-FlgM module, the authors show that protein concentrations and global physiological effects are important for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters.
This paper focuses on the study of Oligoryzomys fulvescens, a rodent species that is an important reservoir host of the Choclo virus in Central America. The authors analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution of O. fulvescens using different statistical methods in a study conducted in the community of Agua Buena in Tonosí, Panama, between April 2006 and December 2009. They found that O. fulvescens had heterogeneous population densities and degrees of dispersion that varied across seasons and among years. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that local populations of O. fulvescens encompassed approximately 300-600 meters. The authors concluded that the Choclo virus transmission risk in this area was associated with the spatial and temporal dynamics of O. fulvescens, which were affected by seasonality and anthropogenic pressures.
Influenza viruses are a major cause of death and disease worldwide. They are constantly evolving, leading to the emergence of new strains that can evade pre-existing host immunity. To make efficient vaccines against influenza viruses, it is important to understand their evolutionary path. A new method has been developed that can predict the antigenic impact of amino acid changes in the viral surface protein hemagglutinin. This method is based on inferring an "antigenic tree" for hemagglutinin, where the antigenic weight is assigned to each branch of the tree. This allows for a more fine-grained resolution of the antigenic impact of individual amino acid changes. The method was applied to hemagglutinin sequences and serological data from human influenza A (H3N2) viral isolates from 1968 to 2003. It identified the amino acid changes associated with antigenic type transitions and known and novel key HA sites. This new method could help in the development of more effective influenza vaccines.
A new study is introducing a new method to understand how HPV (human papillomavirus) infects cells. This method uses RNAi technology to identify genes that are important for HPV infection. The study found that the virus needs the nuclear envelope to break down during mitosis to get into the nucleus. This is important because it explains why HPV can only infect cells that are dividing. This new method of studying HPV infection is important for developing new treatments for HPV-related diseases.
Black Sigatoka is a serious disease that affects banana crops worldwide. It is caused by a fungus called Pseudocercospora fijiensis. The disease is difficult to manage and requires frequent fungicide treatments, which are costly and environmentally damaging. The genome of Pseudocercospora fijiensis has been sequenced, and it is found to be extremely large and expanded by LTR retrotransposons. This could be an advantage for the fungus to adapt and evolve to different environments. Melting-curve assays and analyses of molecular markers suggest that two other fungi in the Sigatoka disease complex also have expanded genomes. The genome sequence will be useful for developing better methods to manage the disease and improve banana breeding programs.
In this paper, the authors present a novel method to study the evolution of regulatory elements in the human genome, specifically the binding sites of transcription factors. Using a birth-death model, the authors analyzed the evolution of binding sites for six transcription factors (GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, and ETS1) along the lineage toward human after the human-mouse common ancestor. The authors found that a substantial fraction of binding sites in humans have origins since the divergence with mouse, and that over 15% of all binding sites are unique to hominids. These lineage-specific regulatory elements are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways and harbor more common SNPs than older binding sites in the human genome. These results support the ability of the method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and help understand their roles in shaping variation in gene regulation across species.
The zebrafish is a unique animal model for studying how the circadian clock is entrained by light. Unlike mammals, most of its tissues respond directly to light, leading to local clock entrainment. Light induces the expression of a set of genes, including certain clock genes, in most zebrafish cell types in vivo and in vitro. The zebrafish period2 (per2) gene is one of the clock genes whose expression is induced by light. In this study, researchers used transgenic fish and stably transfected cell line-based assays to define a Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the per2 promoter, which is both necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and also for a light-dependent circadian clock regulation. The LRM lies proximal to the transcription start site and contains E- and D-box elements that are critical for its function. The human LRM can substitute for the zebrafish LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zebrafish cells. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that the zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF) binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression. TEF mRNA levels are light inducible, and knock-down of TEF expression attenuates light-driven transcription from the per2 promoter in vivo. Together, the findings suggest that a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression. The study extends the general understanding of the mechanism whereby the clock is entrained by light and how the regulation of clock gene expression by light has evolved in vertebrates.
This study is about the movement of Plasmodium sporozoites, the motile form of a rodent malaria-causing parasite. The authors investigated how the parasite moves and how its movement is controlled. They found that a protein called coronin is important for the parasite to move properly. Coronin is thought to help the parasite move by organizing actin filaments. The authors also found that calcium and cAMP are important for the parasite to switch from moving to invading a host cell. This study will help us better understand how malaria parasites move and how we can stop them from causing disease.
In this study, the authors characterize four new amphotericin B (AmB)-resistant Leishmania mexicana lines. They found that all four lines had altered sterol biosynthesis, and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole genome sequencing revealed that one line had a resistance-associated mutation of the sterol C5-desaturase gene, while three other lines had loss of expression of the sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT) gene responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. The authors also found that additional loss of the miltefosine transporter was associated with one of those lines. They also found that reduced overall expression was associated with loss of the 3’ untranslated region of the dominant gene copy, resulting from structural variations at this locus. The authors suggest that such repeat sequence-mediated instability is a significant concern, especially since it has been associated with resistance to a major antileishmanial drug, with no evidence of associated fitness costs. They suggest that understanding the routes by which resistance may emerge is an important priority, and that their findings can help guide strategies for controlling and treating leishmaniasis.
The human brain is thought to use two processes, "prediction" and "attention," to interpret and prioritize incoming sensory information. It is not clear, however, how these two processes interact. A recent extension of the "predictive coding" theory suggests that attention increases the selectivity of prediction errors, which code for the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features. This model would suggest that attention increases the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. Alternative predictive coding models propose that attention increases the activity of prediction neurons, suggesting that attention and prediction synergistically modulate selectivity for feature information in the brain. In the current study, researchers used forward encoding models to test the effect of attention on mismatch and feature information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. They found that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that contained information related to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features. Attention also increased the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. These findings support the hypothesis that attention increases the gain of prediction errors.
Trypanosoma brucei is an important parasite in sub-Saharan Africa. There are three sub-species of T. brucei: T. b. brucei, T. b. gambiense, and T. b. rhodesiense. T. b. brucei is unable to infect humans because it is sensitive to human serum that contains proteins that can kill the parasite. T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense are resistant to human serum and can infect humans. These two sub-species differ in their ability to resist human serum. Group 1 T. b. gambiense have an invariant phenotype, meaning they are always resistant to human serum, while group 2 T. b. gambiense show variable resistance. Researchers have found that group 1 T. b. gambiense are resistant to trypanosome lytic factor 1 (TLF-1) due to reduced uptake of TLF-1. This reduced uptake is due to reduced expression of the TLF-1 receptor (HpHbR) gene. In this study, researchers compared the ability of group 1 and group 2 T. b. gambiense to internalize TLF-1 and APOL1. They found that both group 1 and group 2 T. b. gambiense internalized fluorescently labeled TLF-1 and APOL1, but only group 2 T. b. gambiense were lysed by APOL1. The researchers conclude that group 2 T. b. gambiense is innately resistant to APOL1, which could be based on the same mechanism as group 1 T. b. gambiense. However, group 2 T. b. gambiense variably displays this phenotype and expression does not appear to correlate with a change in expression site or expression of HpHbR. Thus, there are differences in the mechanism of human serum resistance between T. b. gambiense groups 1 and 2.
HIV-1 is a virus that causes AIDS. To evade the body's immune system and antiviral drugs, HIV-1 uses a mechanism called DNA methylation to turn off its own transcription and form a latent reservoir in the body. This study is the first to show that DNA methylation is an important mechanism that controls the stability of the HIV-1 latency. The study used an in vitro model of HIV-1 latency and patient data to show that HIV-1 LTR methylation is a mechanism that turns off the virus's transcription and prevents it from being reactivated. This study is important because it helps us understand how HIV-1 forms a latent reservoir and how it can be eradicated from the body.
The paper presents a comprehensive list of genetic variants in Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP), which is a population resource consisting of 192 sequenced wild-derived inbred lines. The authors used an integrative approach to identify over 3.6 million distinct variants, including insertions, deletions, complex substitutions, and structural variants. The study also provides insights into the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation by mapping cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) for more than 2,000 genes. The authors found that indels comprise around 10% of all cis-eQTLs and show larger effects than SNP cis-eQTLs. The study revealed a partial decoupling of the genomic architecture between the sexes and the importance of genetic factors in mediating sex-biased gene expression. The majority of strong cis-eQTLs can be validated in heterozygous individuals using RNA-seq-based allelic expression imbalance analyses in the offspring of crosses between sequenced lines. Overall, the study provides a valuable resource for further investigating the molecular basis of morphological evolution, gene expression variation, and other phenotypic traits in Drosophila.
The rectified EMG signal is used to estimate the neural drive to muscles and therefore infer sources of synaptic input to motor neurons. However, the overlap of motor unit action potentials, known as amplitude cancellation, distorts the spectrum of the rectified EMG and can lead to inaccurate estimation of the neural drive. In this study, we investigated the impact of amplitude cancellation on this correlation using analytical derivations and a computational model of motor neuron activity, force, and the EMG signal. We found that amplitude cancellation distorts the spectrum of the rectified EMG signal, and that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons.
Auxin is important for controlling root growth, but how it is regulated in response to aluminum (Al) stress is unknown. This study has found that a group of proteins called YUCCAs control the synthesis of auxin in the root-apex transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. Aluminum causes the upregulation of five YUCCA genes in the root-apex TZ, which in turn leads to the accumulation of auxin in the TZ and the inhibition of root growth. This process is regulated by ethylene signaling, as enhancing or reducing ethylene signaling causes either enhanced or reduced upregulation of YUCCA genes in response to Al stress, respectively. Ethylene-insensitive3 (EIN3) and Phytochrome Interacting Factor4 (PIF4) play key roles in this process by regulating the transcription of YUCCA genes in response to Al stress. This study has shed new light on how Al stress affects root growth and may lead to new ways to protect plants from Al toxicity.
In this study, we investigated the impact of viral peptides on the activity of natural killer (NK) cells. We found that certain viral peptides can suppress the activity of NK cells and may help viruses avoid being killed by NK cells. This study provides new insights into how viruses can evade the immune system and highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between viruses and NK cells.
Bacteria that need to survive in changing environments may change over time through microevolution, which can help them adapt and survive. We have shown that a type of bacteria that causes otitis media (OM) called Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) can change over time in response to a lack of nutrients. We have also shown that NTHI can form communities within the cells of the middle ear, called intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). These IBCs may help NTHI survive and persist in the middle ear, even after antibiotics are used to treat OM. This may explain why children can have repeated episodes of OM caused by the same strain of NTHI.
Melioidosis is a rare but severe bacterial infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei. It is known that high levels of iron in the body can increase susceptibility to this infection. In this study, researchers wanted to investigate how B. pseudomallei modulates iron balance and how changes in host iron content affect its growth within the body. They found that B. pseudomallei downregulates the expression of ferroportin, which is a protein that exports iron from cells. This results in higher iron availability within macrophages, the cells that B. pseudomallei infects first. When the researchers added more iron to the macrophages, it stimulated the growth of B. pseudomallei. On the other hand, when they used a drug to reduce iron availability, it decreased the growth of B. pseudomallei. They also found that B. pseudomallei can acquire iron from heme, which is a component of hemoglobin found in red blood cells. The researchers also found that B. pseudomallei can take up iron from host proteins like transferrin and lactoferrin. These results suggest that B. pseudomallei has developed strategies to acquire iron from the host to support its growth. The researchers concluded that B. pseudomallei modulates cellular iron balance to improve its iron acquisition and to restrict antibacterial immune effector mechanisms. They also found that changes in host iron homeostasis can influence susceptibility to melioidosis, a serious bacterial infection. The researchers suggest that drugs that chelate iron may be an additional therapeutic option for treating melioidosis.
We propose a new method, called functional mode analysis, which aims to detect the specific collective motion in a protein that is related to a particular function. By analyzing a set of protein structures and a functional quantity that describes the desired function, this method can identify the collective motion that is most correlated to the functional quantity. The new method is illustrated using several examples, including a polyalanine helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein. The method can help in understanding how a protein's function is related to its motion.
Nuclear genes of euglenids and marine diplonemids contain unusual introns that are not found in the genomes of other eukaryotes. These nonconventional introns do not have the same structure as other types of introns. In the pre-mRNA transcripts of euglenids, nonconventional and conventional introns occur in different genes. It is unknown how these different types of introns are removed from the transcripts. In this study, the authors analyzed the order of intron removal for two genes that contain both nonconventional and conventional introns. They found that nonconventional introns are removed earlier than conventional introns, and that there is a time gap between the removal of the two types of introns. This is the first time that the order of removal of these two types of introns has been studied, and it provides important information about the splicing process in these organisms.
A study looked at the effects of a virus called Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) on the heart. CVB3 is a common cause of mild infections in people, such as fever, rash, and respiratory problems. In rare cases, it can cause heart problems such as myocarditis, a disease that can lead to heart failure. However, it is not well understood how CVB3 can cause long-term damage to the heart. The study found that CVB3 efficiently infects c-kit+ cells, which are a type of heart stem cell, and that the number of these cells in the heart is reduced in adult mice that were infected with CVB3 as juveniles. This reduction in c-kit+ cells may impair the heart's ability to increase its blood vessels to adapt to increased load, leading to a higher risk of heart failure. The study suggests that a mild CVB3 infection can cause long-term damage to the heart, but more research is needed to understand the exact mechanisms.
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a bacterium that can cause a disease called melioidosis, which is common in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. When a person is infected with B. pseudomallei, it can cause various diseases including pneumonia, organ abscesses, and septicemia. The bacterium can invade phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells and replicate in the host cell cytosol by using a T3SS3. Macrophages are important for controlling the early replication of the bacterium. In a previous study, we showed that rapid pyroptotic cell death is involved in defence against B. pseudomallei by removing the bacterium's replication niche. However, caspase-1, a protease that contributes to the control of intracellular bacterial replication in macrophages, is also activated by B. pseudomallei. In this study, we investigated the general features of cell death in wild-type macrophages and in caspase-1/11 knockout macrophages unable to induce pyroptosis. We identified downstream signaling pathways of B. pseudomallei-induced caspase-1 activation. We also characterized the role of B. pseudomallei flagellin FliC, the T3SS3 effector protein BopE, and the inner rod protein BsaK in caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis induction, and IL-1β secretion. Our findings help to better understand the mechanism of action of B. pseudomallei and its ability to cause disease.
Pollen grains need to germinate on the stigma of the female plant in order to fertilize the egg. This process is controlled by a plant-specific protein called KINβγ. KINβγ is a cytoplasm- and nucleus-localized protein that is critical for pollen germination. The pollen of a kinβγ mutant cannot germinate on the stigma, although it can germinate normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed that the compromised hydration of the kinβγ mutant pollen on the stigma led to its defective germination. In addition, the kinβγ mutant pollen exhibited reduced levels of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in pollen, and its mitochondria and peroxisomes were damaged. Overexpression of Arabidopsis CATALASE 3, which increases ROS levels in pollen, partially compensated for the reduced hydration of the mutant pollen on the stigma. These results suggest that Arabidopsis KINβγ is critical for the regulation of ROS levels by mediating the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is required for pollen–stigma interactions during pollination.
In bacteria, ribonuclease III (RNase III) is a key enzyme that helps process double-stranded RNA. It is important for many biological systems, including ribosomal RNA maturation and mRNA turnover. In the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, RNase III plays an essential role in protecting the cell from toxin genes carried by two prophages. These genes are controlled by antisense RNA, and without RNase III, the toxin genes cannot be degraded properly. The study shows how RNase III is involved in the degradation of the antisense RNA that controls these toxin genes. This helps to ensure that the genes do not cause harm to the cell and that it continues to function properly.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a parasitic disease caused by the filarial nematode Brugia malayi. The parasite releases extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain bioactive proteins and small RNA species that allow secretion of parasite effector molecules and their potential trafficking to host tissues. These vesicles are released across all intra-mammalian life cycle stages of B . malayi, including the infective L3 stage, microfilariae, L4, adult male, and female worms. The EVs released by all stages of B . malayi are internalized by murine macrophages and contain putative host immunomodulatory molecules. The protein components of the vesicles vary in a stage- and sex-specific manner, suggesting that the parasite's ability to modulate the host immune response may have a sexual dimorphic element. Finally, the process of EV release is inhibited by ivermectin, suggesting a potential mechanism of action for this drug and highlighting EV release as a possible assay platform in future drug discovery efforts.
The article is about two common skin conditions, scabies and impetigo, which are treatable but often occur together in rural areas with warm and humid climates. The article discusses how there is a lack of good quality epidemiological data from the Solomon Islands, but a study was done in ten rural villages in the Western Province. The total prevalence of scabies in the study was 19.2%, with the highest prevalence found in children aged 1-4 years. The prevalence of impetigo was 26.7%, with the highest prevalence found in children aged 1-4 years as well. The study found that scabies infestation is strongly associated with impetigo infection. It also suggests that community control strategies for scabies may reduce the burden of both conditions and their downstream complications.
Adult neurogenesis occurs in the hippocampus of mice and its function is not clear. In this study, the authors used heterogeneous stock (HS) mice to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence adult neurogenesis. They found that QTLs affecting neurogenesis are also linked to other traits, such as disease models, haematological, immunological, and anatomical assays. These traits include anxiety, contextual fear conditioning, and novelty suppressed feeding, which are previously suggested to be related to neurogenesis. The authors suggest that their findings may indicate that adult neurogenesis has broader roles than previously thought, beyond learning, memory, and emotional regulation.
Chagas disease is a serious health problem in Latin America and is now becoming a problem in the US due to an increase in immigration. Previous research has screened a database of Trypanosoma cruzi genes to find potential vaccine candidates. In this study, a DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine was tested in mice. This vaccine included several antigen candidates that had been previously identified as potentially protective against Chagas disease. The vaccine was shown to induce a strong antibody response and a moderate level of T cell proliferation, leading to protection from acute parasite infection. The vaccine also led to a type 1 cytokine response, which has been shown to be protective against Chagas disease. In chronic infection, the vaccine led to a decrease in inflammation and tissue parasitism.
In this study, we propose using sophisticated machine learning algorithms with a large ensemble of markers to improve the performance of disease risk assessment for complex diseases, such as type 1 diabetes. We applied a support vector machine algorithm on a genotyping dataset generated on the Affymetrix platform for type 1 diabetes, and optimized a risk assessment model with hundreds of markers. We then tested this model on an independent Illumina-genotyped dataset, as well as a separate Affymetrix-genotyped dataset, resulting in an area under ROC curve of approximately 0.84 in both datasets. In contrast, poor performance was achieved when we limited the model to dozens of known susceptibility loci in the SVM model or logistic regression model. Our study suggests that improved disease risk assessment can be achieved by using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers. We are optimistic that genotype-based disease risk assessment may be feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of the risk has already been captured by SNP arrays.
This research looked at how memory CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell, respond to infection in the skin. These cells can remember past infections and quickly respond to new ones. The researchers found that memory CD8+ T cells can enter the skin quickly and provide protection against viral infections in the skin. They also found that memory CD8+ T cells can become tissue-resident memory cells (TRM), which are CD69+/CD103- and are important for providing protection against skin infections in the long term. The researchers also discovered that memory CD8+ T cells can use cytolysis, or cell death, to provide protection against viral infections in the skin. This research provides important information about how memory CD8+ T cells can protect the skin from viral infections.
Proteins in neurons are found in different areas of the cell depending on their function. Axonal proteins are mainly found in the axon, while dendritic proteins are mainly found in the dendrites. Researchers found that Myosin VI, a type of motor, plays a role in making sure proteins are found in the right place. They also discovered that the proteins are sometimes moved from the axon to the dendrites and back. To do this, Myosin VI helps move the proteins to the right place. Additionally, Myosin VI is important for making sure that the proteins are found on the surface of the cell. This is important for the function of the neurons.
This study is about two genes that control sexual characteristics in the water flea Daphnia magna. These genes are important because they are involved in determining whether an animal reproduces sexually or asexually, depending on the environment. The authors identified two similar genes in D. magna, named DapmaDsx1 and DapmaDsx2. They then used genetic and molecular techniques to determine the function of these genes. They found that DapmaDsx1 is responsible for controlling male characteristics in a specific period of the animal's life, and that it is expressed differently between males and females. The authors also found that DapmaDsx1 is similar to genes that control sexual characteristics in insects, which are thought to be closely related to branchiopods like D. magna. However, the way that DapmaDsx1 is regulated is different from what is seen in insects. The authors concluded that the functions of Dsx genes are conserved across different animal lineages, but the way that they are regulated has evolved independently. This study adds to our understanding of how animals determine whether to reproduce sexually or asexually, depending on the environment. It also shows that genes that control sexual characteristics have similar functions across different species, but may be regulated differently.
Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection, but there is no cure. The current study examines a potential vaccine for genital herpes. The vaccine contains three proteins that are designed to block the virus from entering the body and to prevent the virus from evading the body's immune response. The study found that the vaccine was effective in preventing genital lesions and reducing the amount of virus that was shed from the genitals after infection. Overall, the vaccine showed promising results and may help prevent the spread of genital herpes.
ChIP-seq is a technique that maps proteins bound to DNA in cells, which helps identify important regulatory regions of the genome. However, some regions of the genome contain repeated sequences, and when reads from these regions are mapped to the reference genome, they can match multiple locations. This creates ambiguity about the true origin of these reads. Standard analysis methods for ChIP-seq ignore these multi-mapping reads or use only a small fraction of them. However, the true origin of these reads is important for understanding the regulatory activity in these regions, such as segmental duplications or LINE elements that contain near-identical DNA sequences. Therefore, we developed a new method called Perm-seq, which uses additional data from DNase-seq to accurately allocate multi-mapping reads. We evaluated our method and found that it significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy compared to methods that do not use additional data. We also applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells, and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis revealed that although the protein-DNA interaction sites in these regions are evolutionarily less conserved, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interaction regions identified by uniquely mapping reads. This is an important finding because it means that the regulatory activity in these important regions of the genome can be studied using standard methods, despite the challenges posed by their repetitive nature.
This study investigated whether a parasitic infection called schistosomiasis increases the odds of getting HIV and the viral load at the time of HIV-1 infection in adults living in Tanzania. The study found that women with schistosome infections were more likely to become HIV-infected and had higher HIV-1 viral loads at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion compared to those without schistosome infections. However, men with schistosome infections did not have an increased risk of HIV-1 acquisition or viral loads. This study shows that schistosome infections may increase the risk of HIV-1 infection and viral load in women. Further research is needed to confirm these findings.
A study by Chen et al. has explored how rDNA copy number is regulated in mammalian genomes. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is an essential part of the genome that encodes the functional RNAs of the ribosome, which is responsible for protein synthesis. The number of rDNA copies varies in human genomes, with an estimated range of 14–410 copies. The study used computational and droplet digital PCR approaches to measure rDNA copy number in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes. The results showed that copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Human cancer genomes showed a loss of copies, accompanied by global copy number co-variation and more variable sequence. Loss of copies occurs early and is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Surprisingly, hematopoietic cancer stem cells from a Pten-/- mouse model for leukemia had lower rDNA copy number than normal tissue despite increased proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis. This study provides evidence that rDNA copy number can act as a simple and useful indicator of whether a cancer will be sensitive to DNA damaging treatments.
In this study, we describe a new approach to understand the growth and spread of bacteria inside a host, specifically in the context of a Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection of mice. We used a combination of eight isogenic tagged strains and quantitative PCR to track the growth of each strain in multiple organs over the course of the infection. By analyzing the dynamics of each strain separately, we were able to gain insights into the spread and growth of bacteria within the host. We found that during the initial stages of the infection, there was rapid bacterial replication and death, leading to the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs. Later in the infection, there was a decrease in microbial death, leading to an exponential increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally and mix between organs via bacteraemia. This approach provides a new outlook on the dynamics of Salmonella enterica infections and highlights the complex and stochastic nature of within-host bacterial dynamics. Our work also illustrates the importance of considering multiple subpopulations within the same host when studying infectious diseases.
3D motion is the perception of moving objects in three dimensions. To solve the inverse optics problem, which is the determination of the direction and speed of motion in a 3D environment from 2D input, several models have been proposed in the past. These models are based on interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity. These models have limitations and do not provide a general solution to the inverse optics problem. The authors suggest that local velocity constraints combined with binocular disparity and other depth cues can provide a more flexible framework for solving the inverse optics problem. The authors also distinguish between two default strategies of 3D motion processing: the vector normal prefers slow motion in 3D while the cyclopean average is based on slow motion in 2D. Experimental results suggest that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are needed to solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. The authors propose that motion and disparity input is processed in parallel and integrated late in the visual processing hierarchy.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a type of bacteria that can cause lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis. The bacteria make a sticky substance called alginate to protect themselves from antibiotics and other treatments. Alginate is made from long chains of a sugar called mannuronic acid. The chains of mannuronic acid are acetylated (attached to acetate molecules) to make the alginate even stickier. Four proteins are thought to be involved in adding acetate to alginate in P. aeruginosa: AlgI, AlgJ, AlgX, and AlgF. AlgJ and AlgX are proteins that can attach acetate molecules to the mannuronic acid chains, while AlgI and AlgF are not believed to have any role in acetylation. In this study, the authors determined the structure of AlgJ and tested its function in acetylation. They found that AlgJ is not able to bind to mannuronic acid chains or attach acetate molecules to them. They also found that AlgX is able to attach acetate molecules to mannuronic acid chains. The authors suggest that AlgJ and AlgX have different roles in acetylation, and that the four-protein system used by P. aeruginosa is more complex than the three-protein system used by other bacteria.
Candida albicans is a type of fungus that commonly causes human infections and can be fatal. To protect against C. albicans, the human body has a defense system that recognizes the fungal cell wall, which contains a type of sugar called β-1,3-glucan. However, C. albicans can hide this sugar from the defense system by covering it with other substances. Recent studies have found that a specific type of enzyme called phosphatidylserine synthase is involved in hiding β-1,3-glucan. To better understand how this enzyme works, researchers studied the genetic mutant of this enzyme and found that it causes more β-1,3-glucan to be exposed. This leads to a stronger immune response, which may be more effective at fighting C. albicans infections.
This paper is about discovering new genes and their function in Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is a common brain disorder that affects memory and thinking. In this study, the authors analyzed brain samples from 4,914 people and looked for genetic changes associated with the disease. They also looked at the different types of brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease, such as plaques and tangles. They found that there were genetic changes associated with different types of brain changes. They also found that some genetic changes that were thought to be associated with Alzheimer's disease were actually associated with other brain changes. This study helps us better understand the genetic causes of Alzheimer's disease and how it affects the brain.
Protein unfolding is the process by which a protein changes from a folded, functional structure to an unfolded, non-functional structure. Urea is a chemical commonly used to study the unfolding of proteins. However, despite decades of research, it is not entirely clear how urea affects the unfolding process. In this study, researchers used computer simulations to investigate the role of urea in unfolding and found that it actively induces unfolding by stabilizing partially unfolded microstates. The researchers used a variety of proteins and force-fields in their simulations to ensure the results were universal. Overall, the study provides a comprehensive picture of how urea affects the unfolding of proteins.
A research review was done to understand the spread of dengue disease in Colombia. Researchers found that the number of dengue cases in Colombia is stable each year, but there were big outbreaks in 2001, 2002, and 2010. Most of the cases were among people under the age of 15. The researchers found that there are gaps in the knowledge of dengue disease in Colombia, such as information about asymptomatic dengue virus infections, different types of infections (primary or secondary), and under-reporting of the disease. The researchers hope that this review will help fill these gaps and provide a basis for future research and policies related to dengue disease prevention.
This paper reviews the prevalence of coinfections with Leishmania, a parasite that causes tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) in humans. The paper also discusses the interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, as well as the implications of these coinfections on clinical practice. The paper concludes that TL coinfections are common, may cause diagnostic errors and delays, and can affect the effectiveness and safety of treatment. More research is needed to understand how coinfections affect the pathogenesis of TL.
We studied how natural genetic variation affects the expression of MHC class I and II proteins and the ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cells in rats. We used two genetic models, the Heterogeneous Stock rats and MHC-recombinant congenic strains. In Heterogeneous Stock rats, we mapped QTLs associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein expression and the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio. We found that QTLs for the individual traits overlapped within a region spanning the MHC. To identify the genes underlying these overlapping QTLs, we generated a large panel of MHC-recombinant congenic strains, and refined the QTLs to two adjacent intervals of ∼0 . 25 Mb in the MHC-I and II regions, respectively. An interaction between these intervals affected MHC class I expression as well as negative selection and lineage commitment of CD8 single-positive ( SP ) thymocytes. We mapped this effect to the transporter associated with antigen processing 2 ( Tap2 ) in the MHC-II region and the classical MHC class I gene ( s ) ( RT1-A ) in the MHC-I region. We also identified a novel type of class-I modification that we termed inverse cim , which reduced the expression of TAP-B linked RT1-A molecules if associated with TAP-A . Finally, we showed that polymorphisms in Tap2 significantly contribute to CD8 lineage commitment, likely by altering the class-I peptide repertoire on antigen presenting cells in the thymus.
Chagas disease is a serious illness caused by a parasite named Trypanosoma cruzi, which can lead to heart, digestive, or neurological problems in later years. Chagas disease is mainly transmitted through the bite of a bug called Chagas disease vector, which is a triatomine bug found in 21 Latin American countries. However, the disease can also spread through blood transfusions or organ transplants. Chagas disease is endemic in many Latin American countries and has emerged in non-endemic countries, such as North America, Australia, and Europe, where it is mainly caused by population mobility, particularly migration from Latin American countries. Spain has the highest number of immigrants from Latin American countries in Europe, and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimates that between 40,000 and 65,000 infected people currently reside in Spain. The paper describes Chagas disease hospitalizations in Spain from 1997 to 2011 in terms of time, geographical distribution, and individual characteristics.
The authors present BlocBuster, a novel systems-level approach to efficiently construct genome-wide, allele-specific networks that accurately segregate homogenous combinations of genetic factors, test the associations of these combinations with the given phenotype, and rigorously validate the results using a series of unbiased validation methods. The authors applied BlocBuster to analyze psoriasis, discovering a combinatorial pattern with an odds ratio of 3.64 and a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5.01×10−16. This pattern was replicated in independent data, reflecting robustness of the method. These results demonstrate BlocBuster's potential for discovering combinatorial genetic associations within heterogeneous genome-wide data, thereby transcending the limiting "small effects" produced by individual markers examined in isolation.
A group of researchers investigated the causes of a few brain disorders, including agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH), and polymicrogyria (PMG), that affect the brain development in utero. They analyzed a large number of patients with these disorders and a group of healthy controls to look for genetic differences. The study found a higher prevalence of large gene-rich CNVs in ACC than in CBLH and PMG. The researchers also found a number of large gene-rich de novo CNVs, which were inherited from the father, that are likely to be causing these disorders in single patients. This study shows that ACC patients with gene-rich de novo CNVs are more likely to have an autism spectrum disorder, which may explain some of the social and executive function deficits seen in ACC patients.
The freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, is a unique animal that can regenerate many of its body parts, including parts of its brain, gut, and muscle tissue. The Hippo signaling cascade is a key regulator of growth in most organisms, and the YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activator is the main effector of this pathway in vertebrates. We investigated the role of Yki, the planarian homologue of YAP/TAZ, in the regeneration process. We found that RNA interference knockdown of Yki leads to increased proliferation and the activation of an early injury response program, which is normally turned off after 48 hours. This indicates that Yki plays a crucial role in integrating the proliferative and injury response processes during regeneration. We also found that in Yki-knockdown animals, the brain, gut, and midline did not grow or scale properly, and that the eyes failed to regenerate. Our results suggest that Yki is a critical regulator of multiple early wound response processes during regeneration.
Exosomes are small packages released from cells that contain proteins, lipids, and RNA molecules. These packages can be taken up by other cells and can participate in various biological processes. Some viruses, such as HCV, HTLV-1, and HIV, use exosomes to transfer their genetic materials to new host cells. EV71 is a virus that causes hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and it has been shown that it can transfer its genetic materials to new host cells through exosomes. These exosomes also contain a specific cellular miRNA called miR-146a that can suppress the immune response of the new host cells and facilitate the replication of the virus. The findings of this study suggest that exosomes play a crucial role in the EV71 life cycle and could potentially be used as a target for developing new treatments for HFMD.
Researchers have identified a new player in a process that helps keep the cells healthy. This process is called mitophagy, which is the removal of damaged mitochondria in cells. The new player is called phosphoglycerate mutase 5 (PGAM5). Previous studies have suggested that PGAM5 is not important for this process, but new research has shown that it is actually involved in the process of mitophagy. The researchers used Drosophila models to show that PGAM5 is required for maintaining the integrity of mitochondria. They also showed that loss of PGAM5 activity improves the mitochondrial defects caused by PINK1 inactivation in Drosophila. This is an exciting new discovery that will help us understand how to keep cells healthy and prevent disease.
Buruli ulcer is a disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium ulcerans and affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is mainly found in rural areas of West Africa, but has also been reported in America, Australia, and Asia. The bacteria produce a toxin called mycolactone, which is responsible for the disease's cytotoxic effects. Mycolactone is essential for the bacteria's virulence and has been shown to downregulate the immune response of mammalian cells. However, individuals living in BU-endemic areas often develop antibodies against the bacteria, indicating that the immune system is capable of clearing the infection. Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is a cytokine that is critical for host defense against intracellular pathogens and may play a role in containing M . ulcerans infections. In a mouse model of the disease, IFNγ knockout mice had a faster progression of the infection compared to wild-type mice, with more tissue necrosis and oedema formation, as well as a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This indicates that IFNγ is important for clearing the bacteria during the early intra-macrophage growth phase. These findings support the idea that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for BU.
The Q-cycle of complex III in mitochondrial electron transport can operate in two different steady states at the same set of parameters, one with high rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the other with low ROS production. The system can be switched from one steady state to another one by the initial state, the level of succinate, and the availability of oxygen. The experimental data of isolated brain mitochondria are consistent with the predictions of the model. The proposed mechanism explains the paradoxical increase of ROS production induced by anoxia and reoxygenation.
The gap gene network is a key model system for understanding how genes control patterns of gene expression in living organisms. In this study, we used an integrative, systems-level approach to investigate the regulatory effect of the terminal gap gene huckebein (hkb) on gap gene expression. We presented quantitative expression data for the Hkb protein, which allowed us to include hkb in gap gene circuits. Gap gene circuits are mathematical models of gene networks that have been used to extract regulatory information from spatial gene expression data. By fitting the model to gap gene expression patterns, we obtained estimates for regulatory parameters that predict a specific network topology. We showed that considering variability in the data combined with analysis of parameter determinability significantly improved the biological relevance and consistency of the approach. Our models are in agreement with earlier results and extend them in two important respects: First, we showed that Hkb is involved in the regulation of the posterior hunchback (hb) domain but does not have any other essential function. Specifically, Hkb is required for the anterior shift in the posterior border of this domain, which is now reproduced correctly in our models. Second, our gap gene circuits presented here are able to reproduce mutants of terminal gap genes, while previously published models were unable to reproduce any null mutants correctly. As a consequence, our models now capture the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system correctly. This is an important step towards a better, quantitative understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap gene network.
Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and various animals worldwide, including cattle. Currently, there is no effective therapy or biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy for Brucellosis. Treatment is ineffective and animals remain carriers for life. Phage lysates of two live attenuated vaccine strains of Brucella abortus, RB51 and S19, have been found to be effective in treating bovine Brucellosis. RB51 phage lysates induce cell-mediated immunity and are resistant to Rifampicin, while S19 phage lysates induce antibodies. A single subcutaneous dose of a cocktail of phage lysates eliminated live virulent Brucella from Brucellosis-affected cattle within 3 months of immunization. Brucella-specific RNA in plasma was used as a biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy in a non-destructive and minimally invasive manner. This is the first report on the use of phage lysates for the successful immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle and minimally invasive monitoring of therapy efficacy using Brucella-specific RNA in plasma.
In this paper, the authors used a chemical genetics approach to study the role of a specific CDK2 in protecting genomic integrity. They replaced wild-type Cdk2 with a mutant version sensitized to inhibition by bulky adenine analogs in human cells. They found that transient and selective inhibition of analog-sensitive (AS) Cdk2 after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) enhances cell-killing. In extracts supplemented with an ATP analog used preferentially by AS kinases, Cdk2as phosphorylated the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome gene product Nbs1, a component of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex required for normal DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling. In vivo, selective inhibition of Cdk2 delayed and diminished Nbs1-Ser432 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased IR sensitivity. Therefore, by chemical genetics, they uncovered both a non-redundant requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage and a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA repair machinery.
Researchers have found ways to identify the functional variants responsible for certain traits and diseases using genome-wide association (GWA) studies. These variants can be common or low-frequency, and they are often found in intronic and intergenic regions. Many of these initial association signals are likely to be regulatory variants, meaning they control gene expression. To find these functional variants, researchers can use techniques such as fine-mapping and functional annotation using biochemical assays. These studies have shown that some trait-associated alleles are related to cellular functions and pathways. For example, genetic loci associated with platelet counts have been linked to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. To explore this further, researchers used a technique called formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to map open chromatin regions in a megakaryocytic and an erythroblastoid cell line. These open chromatin regions are likely to contain regulatory variants. The researchers then compared the chromatin architecture of the two cell types and looked at the phenotypic causality of variants that fell into NDRs specific to either cell type. They found a site of open chromatin in megakaryocytes but not erythroblasts, and they elucidated the molecular mechanism that contributes to the platelet phenotype. In summary, this study shows how GWA studies can be used to identify functional variants and how these variants can contribute to certain traits and diseases.
The study investigates how pharmacological blockade of voltage-gated ion channels affects neuronal and circuit activity. The study uses computer simulations to show that different mechanisms of action can have different effects on neuronal and circuit activity. Specifically, the study looks at the persistent sodium current (INaP) in respiratory pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) neurons and simulates blockade of INaP using two different drugs: tetrodotoxin (TTX) and riluzole (RZ). TTX blocks INaP by directly obstructing the sodium pore, while RZ shifts INaP inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction. The study shows that TTX block of INaP effectively stops respiratory rhythms in the intact respiratory network, while RZ block does not. This is because after RZ application, INaP can be reactivated by transient hyperpolarizing perturbations. The study suggests that the failure of RZ to stop respiratory rhythms in intact experimental preparations does not rule out a central role for INaP in rhythm generation, as the study supports. The study highlights the importance of considering the mechanism of action when interpreting and simulating experimental data from pharmacological blocking studies.
In this study, we examined the role of the microRNA (miRNA) miR-218 in the metastasis of gastric cancer. We found that miR-218 is decreased in highly invasive GC cells, and its downregulation is correlated with advanced clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor prognosis in patients. We also discovered that Robo1, a receptor for the Slit protein family, is a functional target of miR-218. We found an intriguing negative feedback loop between Slit proteins and miR-218 that plays a crucial role in GC cell motility. Our findings not only provide new insights into the metastatic mechanisms in GC, but they also reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of receptor signaling.
The paper is about studying the effects of cholesterol lowering on atherosclerosis, which is a progressive disease that can cause heart attack and stroke. They used a special mouse model that has a similar plasma lipoprotein profile to that of human familial hypercholesterolemia and a genetic switch to lower plasma lipoproteins. They then measured changes in gene expression related to the disease at different stages of atherosclerosis development and identified a group of 37 cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes that are responsible for preventing the formation of advanced plaques. This study provides important information for developing new therapies for atherosclerosis.
Scientists have created a new test to find genes that help bacteria build their protective outer shell. They used this test on E. coli and found 102 genes that might play a role in building the outer shell. They also studied one of these genes, ycbC, in more detail and found that it helps the bacteria grow by making a chemical that is important for building the outer shell. This new test might help scientists find new ways to treat bacterial infections.
Researchers are studying biological systems using more and more techniques, but it is difficult to combine all the data into a complete picture. This paper presents a way to do that using a special kind of learning method and data from images of a protein called Dorsal in the early Drosophila embryo. The Dorsal protein is important for creating the Dorsal-Ventral (DV) stripes in the embryo, which help control cell fates and tissue deformations. Researchers have studied how different things like gene expression and protein phosphorylation work together to create the DV stripes, but they have only looked at a few of those things at the same time. This paper suggests a way to combine that information into a full picture of how all those things work together. They do this by treating the data as a big puzzle and trying to figure out what the missing pieces are based on the information they already have. They show that their method works well on both synthetic and real data.
Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) from different classes are compared in terms of their ability to hydrolyze basement membrane components, their tissue localization, and the effect of these toxins on the microvasculature. The analysis was conducted using immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and immunochemistry techniques. The results showed that PII and PIII SVMPs co-localize with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules to a higher extent than PI SVMP. The patterns of hydrolysis by these enzymes of type IV collagen, nidogen, laminin, and other extracellular matrix components differ, and proteomic analysis of exudate collected from the tissue injected with these SVMPs revealed differences in the pathological effects induced by these toxins.
The study focuses on the regulation of the homeotic gene abd-A by the non-coding RNA (ncRNA) iab-8. The authors find that the iab-8 ncRNA is expressed in the epidermis and central nervous system of embryos, and that it represses abd-A expression in the posterior central nervous system. They also show that the repression is dependent on the miR-iab-8 microRNA, and that it is likely caused by transcriptional interference. Finally, they suggest that this regulation may be important for the posterior dominance of homeotic genes in Drosophila.
This study is about understanding why certain brain seizures start differently from others. There are two main types of seizure onsets: one where the seizure starts with a series of high frequency oscillations called low amplitude fast oscillations (LAF), and another where the seizure starts with a single high amplitude wave called high amplitude slow oscillations (HAS). Researchers have studied these two types of onsets extensively, but they still don’t know why they happen differently. To figure this out, the researchers used a computer model of the brain that has been shown to work well in simulating seizures. They then tested the model by comparing it to real brain recordings from people with seizures. The researchers found that LAF seizures start with many small patches of seizure activity that slowly grow together over time. In contrast, HAS seizures start with a single large event that spreads throughout the entire brain. The researchers believe that the difference in how these two types of seizures start is related to the way the surrounding healthy brain tissue responds to the seizure. They think that the healthy tissue might be more excitable in the case of LAF seizures, which would make it more likely to join in and become part of the seizure. On the other hand, in the case of HAS seizures, the healthy tissue might not be as excitable, which would make it less likely to join in. The researchers believe that this difference in the surrounding tissue could be the reason why some people with seizures respond well to treatment and others don’t. They also think that this difference in the surrounding tissue might explain why some people with seizures have a better outcome when the part of their brain that is causing the seizure is removed, while others don’t. Finally, the researchers suggest that it might be possible to test their theory by stimulating the brain in a specific way, and seeing if that changes how the surrounding healthy tissue responds to the seizure.
This paper describes the role of four proteins in the process of fertilization in plants. These proteins are specifically found in the embryo sac, which is a part of the female reproductive structure. These proteins are thought to be involved in a signaling process that causes the pollen tube to burst, releasing the sperm cells. The paper suggests that this process is important for successful fertilization and may be a way for different plant species to prevent hybridization.
This study looks at how well a type of virus called herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) kills off cancer cells. The cancer cells that the virus targets are those that express a specific protein called HER-2. This protein is overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancer cells, so it was thought that the virus could be retargeted to target and kill off these cancer cells. The researchers first created a virus that was retargeted to specifically kill off cancer cells that express high levels of HER-2. They then tested this virus in mice with cancer cells that had spread to the peritoneal cavity, a common location for cancer cells to spread to in the human body. The virus was shown to effectively target and kill off cancer cells that expressed high levels of HER-2, and to inhibit the spread of cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of the protein Sfi1 in regulating the duplication of the Spindle Pole Body (SPB) in yeast. The SPB is a structure that serves as the center of the mitotic spindle, and its duplication is essential for proper chromosome segregation. The authors found that Cdk1, a protein that controls the cell cycle, phosphorylates Sfi1 at multiple sites. They also found that dephosphorylation of these sites by the protein Cdc14 promotes the duplication of the SPB. The authors propose that Sfi1 acts as a licensing factor for SPB duplication, and its phosphorylation by Cdk1 blocks duplication. The authors also show that reduplication of the SPB occurs when Cdk1 activity is reduced or when Cdc14 is activated. Overall, the study provides important insights into the mechanisms that regulate SPB duplication in yeast.
The article is about a protein called Vpr, which is produced by the HIV virus. Vpr has the ability to cause G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HIV-infected cells in a lab setting. Vpr is also highly conserved in transmitted/founder HIV viruses and is found in all primate lentiviruses. This suggests that Vpr plays an important role in HIV-1 pathogenesis, but its direct evidence in vivo has not been shown. To solve this, researchers used a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model to investigate the role of Vpr in HIV-1 infection in vivo. They found that Vpr causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells, which mainly consist of regulatory CD4+ T cells (Tregs), resulting in Treg depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. The Vpr-dependent enhancement of virus replication and Treg depletion is observed in CCR5-tropic but not CXCR4-tropic HIV-1-infected mice. This suggests that these effects are dependent on the coreceptor usage by HIV-1. Immune activation was observed in CCR5-tropic wild-type but not in vpr-deficient HIV-1-infected humanized mice. When humanized mice were treated with denileukin diftitox (DD), to deplete Tregs, DD-treated humanized mice showed massive activation/proliferation of memory T cells compared to the untreated group. This activation/proliferation enhanced CCR5 expression in memory CD4+ T cells and rendered them more susceptible to CCR5-tropic wild-type HIV-1 infection than to vpr-deficient virus. Taken together, these results suggest that Vpr takes advantage of proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells for enhancing viremia of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Because Tregs exist in a higher cycling state than other T cell subsets, Tregs appear to be more vulnerable to exploitation by Vpr during acute HIV-1 infection.
Vivax malaria is a type of malaria parasite that is found in many parts of the world. The parasite was successfully eliminated in South Korea in the late 1970s, but it was found to have re-emerged from 1993. To understand the transmission of the parasite, researchers analyzed genetic markers from 163 South Korean isolates collected from 1994 to 2008. The results showed that a drastic genetic change occurred in the South Korean population during 2002 and 2003, suggesting that the parasite was continually introduced from other population sources. One possible source was North Korea. These findings suggest that the transmission of vivax malaria in South Korea is not continuous and that control measures may need to be adjusted accordingly.
Introns, which are non-coding segments found in the middle of genes, have been known to enhance the transcription of genes in eukaryotes for over 25 years. While the exact function of introns is still not completely understood, it is believed that they play a role in regulating transcription directionality. This is because most RNA polymerase (RNPII) transcription in eukaryotes starts in both the sense and upstream antisense directions. The transcription in the sense direction produces mRNA, while the transcription in the upstream antisense direction creates a type of transcript called uaRNA. In yeast, uaRNA synthesis is terminated by a poly ( A ) -independent mechanism, while in mammalians it is terminated by the same cleavage and polyadenylation machinery that stops mRNA synthesis. Gene looping, which is the physical interaction of the promoter and terminator regions of a gene in a transcription-dependent manner, has been shown to confer directionality to the promoter-initiated transcription. Now, a recent study has shown that the intron-facilitated gene looping recruits termination factors near the promoter region to selectively terminate uaRNA synthesis, thereby conferring directionality to the promoter-initiated transcription.
Scientists have found a gene called ZBED6 that affects muscle growth and fat deposition in animals. This gene was found after studying a mutation in pigs that was discovered to increase IGF2 production in their muscles. The mutation disrupted the interaction of IGF2 with a repressor, resulting in a 3-fold up-regulation of IGF2 in skeletal muscle. Scientists then identified the repressor and found that it is a previously unknown protein called ZBED6, which is specific for placental mammals and derived from an exapted DNA transposon. Silencing of Zbed6 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts affected Igf2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing using C2C12 cells identified about 2,500 ZBED6 binding sites in the genome, and the deduced consensus motif gave a perfect match with the established binding site in Igf2. Genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites showed a highly significant enrichment for certain Gene Ontology classifications, including development and transcriptional regulation. The phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED6-silenced C2C12 myoblasts, the extreme sequence conservation, its nucleolar localization, the broad tissue distribution, and the many target genes with essential biological functions suggest that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth.
We have discovered the editome of rhesus macaques, a close relative of humans, using a combination of genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal. This study provides the first comprehensive quantitative profile of RNA editing for a non-human primate. We found 31,250 editing sites, of which 99.8% are A-to-G transitions. These findings highlight RNA editing as a widespread functional regulation in primate evolution.
Perception is a complex process that involves interpreting sensory signals and deciding what we see. Researchers have been studying how the brain does this, specifically in the primary visual cortex (V1). One approach is to decode sensory information from the neural responses in V1 into a reliable decision variable. This involves computing the likelihood that specific stimuli gave rise to the observed neural responses, which can be done using a log likelihood function. However, researchers have found that the brain does not always read out the likelihood function precisely at the relevant locations and instead reads it out broadly. This suboptimal decoding could account for previous findings of an unselective pooling of sensory responses. In the study, researchers measured how the brain perceived the spatial frequency of a grating in the presence of filtered visual noise. They found that filtered noise backgrounds dramatically altered the perception of grating spatial frequency. The researchers propose a population code model to simultaneously model grating detectability and discriminability, and estimate the amount of sensory information encoded in the V1 population response. They found that only when read-out functions as broad as 4 octaves are assumed does the model account for all behavioral measurements, indicating that the brain fails to sample the likelihood function at the appropriate locations with arbitrary high precision.
Scientists have found that Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) play a vital role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements. In many organisms, piRNAs appear to be derived from processing of a long, polycistronic RNA precursor. However, researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) have discovered that each Caenorhabditis elegans piRNA represents a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit. This study reveals that each piRNA requires only a 21 nucleotide (nt) piRNA sequence and an approximately 50 nt upstream motif with limited genomic context for expression. The minimal C. elegans piRNA cassette can be expressed independently of other piRNA cassettes in the genome and can be selectively expressed in male or female germline. Over 70% of C. elegans piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female germline, and the genes they target suggest that these two populations have evolved independently. The number of transcriptional units encoding piRNAs rivals the number of mRNA coding genes in the C. elegans genome. The findings of this study provide important insights into the mechanisms of piRNA biogenesis and the regulation of piRNA expression in C. elegans.
Brucella, a zoonotic pathogen, infects both animals and humans. Infection causes severe problems for both animals and humans. The bacterium is able to replicate in host cells, but the process is not well understood. The current study investigated how Brucella replicates within host cells and how it is able to use the host's resources to its advantage. The study identified a host protein called Yip1A as a key factor for Brucella replication. Yip1A is involved in the unfolded protein response, which is a cellular response to stress. The study found that Yip1A is critical for Brucella to establish a safe replication niche within host cells. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of Brucella replication in host cells.
In this work, we show that the Tombusviruses use a cellular protein called Vps34 to build a compartment for their replication. The function of Vps34 is important for the replication of the virus. We found that the kinase function of Vps34 is important for the building of the compartment, and that Vps34 recruits a lipid called PI3P, which helps to build the compartment. We also found that Vps34 interacts directly with a replication protein called p33, which is important for the replication of the virus. Overall, our results suggest that Vps34 and PI3P are important for the replication of Tombusviruses.
The study aimed to compare methods for feeding mosquitoes with blood from humans with dengue fever for use in a larger study. The study was conducted in Iquitos, Peru, between 2011 and 2015. The researchers collected blood from 58 participants with viremias ranging from 1.3×102 to 2.9×106 focus-forming units per mL of serum and used it to feed mosquitoes directly or indirectly, with or without an additive. The study showed that infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different between direct and indirect feeding methods and infection rates varied more after indirect feeding with no additive than indirect feeding with EDTA. The study also showed that there were no differences in infection or dissemination rates in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different dengue illness severity. The study demonstrated the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence. Direct mosquito feeding is preferable due to its logistical ease, biosecurity, and reliability.
A group of drugs called topoisomerase II poisons are used to treat cancer, but they are differentially effective from one patient to the next. A study used the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the genetic basis of this variation. The researchers found that wild strains of C. elegans vary in their sensitivity to these drugs, and they used an unbiased genetic approach to determine that natural variation in a methionine-to-glutamine substitution in the topoisomerase II enzyme is the cause of this variation. The presence of a non-polar methionine at this residue increases hydrophobic interactions between topoisomerase II and etoposide, resulting in increased genomic instability in strains that contain a methionine residue. This residue is conserved in humans, and it has a different amino acid in the two topoisomerase II isoforms. The researchers went on to show that this amino acid difference influences cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II poisons in human cell lines. These results demonstrate the utility of C. elegans in understanding the genetics of drug responses, which can lead to more effective and personalized treatments for cancer patients.
Scientists found that some African mole-rat species have much longer lifespans than similar species, and wanted to learn more about the genes that might be involved in this extended lifespan. They collected genetic and gene expression data from 17 rodent species and looked for genes that had been positively selected along 11 different evolutionary branches that were related to enhanced longevity. They found that many of the identified positively selected genes were related to aging and longevity, and had functions that could help explain why the African mole-rats had longer lifespans. They also found that many of these genes were upregulated or downregulated differently in old and young animals, which could help explain how aging works. Overall, their results suggest that these mole-rat genes could be important for understanding how to extend human lifespans.
This paper presents a new strategy to control the spread of mosquito-borne diseases by introducing a new Wolbachia strain into a mosquito line. The new line, ARwP-M, was created by inserting the wMel Wolbachia strain into an existing line, ARwP, which has wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia strains. The study found that ARwP-M females have 15 times higher levels of Wolbachia than ARwP females and that this high level is associated with a lower rate of transmission of chikungunya and dengue viruses. The study also found that ARwP-M males are more sterile than ARwP males, which may be useful for controlling mosquito populations. Overall, this new line of mosquitoes could be a promising tool for controlling mosquito-borne diseases.
The article "Domain-peptide interactions: Structural and evolutionary aspects" presents a new method to identify domain-peptide interactions (DPI) based on the structural analysis of known high-resolution 3D structures. These interactions play a critical role in signaling networks, where they transmit information and regulate biological processes. The new method involves the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and other structure-encoded information about binding interfaces to search for unnoticed DPIs among known protein interactions. The study reveals that DPIs often have a characteristic stretched and elongated structure, different from other peptides of the same length. The authors also identify novel peptide-binding domains, along with their respective high-resolution 3D structures and consensus motifs, that have not been described before. These new insights provide molecular details for many protein interactions discovered in high-throughput initiatives and suggest relevant mutagenesis experiments to tinker with them.
Environmental enteropathy (EE) is a common health problem that causes stunting in children and growth failure in adults. It is caused by poor sanitation and leads to impaired absorption of nutrients, micronutrient malabsorption, and immune responses to vaccines. We used confocal laser endomicroscopy and other techniques to study EE in 49 adults from Lusaka, Zambia. We found that nearly all of the participants had damage to the intestinal lining. We also found that this damage was associated with increased leakage of material from the gut into the bloodstream, lower nutrient absorption, and higher levels of inflammation in the body. Transcriptomic analysis identified several genes that may be important in protecting the gut from damage. We also found that higher levels of a hormone called GLP-2 were associated with better gut function. We conclude that EE is a complex condition that affects the gut, immune system, and overall health, and that further research is needed to better understand how to prevent and treat it.
The paper introduces the phenomenon of superinfection exclusion (SIE), where a virus stops another virus from infecting the same cell, even if the second virus is very similar to the first. The paper then explains that the SIE phenomenon has been observed in many different types of viruses, including human and animal pathogenic viruses like HIV and HCV, as well as plant viruses like TMV. The paper then explains that SIE is determined by one or a few virus-encoded proteins and relatively little involvement of host cell components, highlighting SIE as a primarily virus-driven phenomenon. The paper then describes the authors' research on the turnip crinkle virus (TCV), which encodes a protein called p28. The authors found that p28 is the only protein responsible for SIE in TCV infections. They also discovered that p28 forms large, mobile punctate inclusions in infected cells that trans-aggregate a non-coalescing, SIE-defective p28 mutant. The authors propose a model whereby p28 forms multimeric complexes that intercept fresh p28 monomers translated from superinfectors, abolishing superinfector replication. The authors also found that this model could be applicable to many other RNA viruses, and predicts a novel target for antiviral therapy.
Scientists have been working on vaccines for Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans. They have been testing vaccines that use DNA or protein from the parasite to stimulate the immune system to make antibodies against the parasite. In this study, scientists tested if adding a protein called IL-15 to the DNA or protein vaccines would improve the immune response and protection against the parasite. They found that adding IL-15 to the DNA or protein vaccines improved the immune response and protection against the parasite for at least 6 months after vaccination.
Scientists discovered a way to control the amount of a protein called PLK in a parasite called Trypanosoma brucei. They found that this protein plays a crucial role in the formation of a new structure called flagellum attachment zone, which helps the parasite to grow. The scientists found that a protein called WDR1 binds to PLK and helps to control its level. When the level of WDR1 is reduced, the level of PLK increases, leading to abnormal development. The scientists believe that this discovery can help to develop new treatments for diseases caused by this parasite.
This paper explores the role of a specific type of protein called DEAD box RNA helicases in the innate immune system. These proteins play an important role in detecting and fighting off infections. In particular, a type of DEAD box RNA helicase called DDX3X was found to be crucial for a response to infection. Mice that lack DDX3X have altered leukocyte compositions, which affects their ability to fight off infections. This is due to decreased effector cell availability and function as well as impaired cytokine synthesis. The study provides evidence for the importance of a non-RLR DEAD box RNA helicase in innate immunity and suggests that this protein may contribute to sex-related differences in resistance to microbes and resilience to inflammatory disease.
A new biophysical model of how male moths detect pheromone molecules has been developed. This model takes into account all the steps of the transduction process, from the arrival of pheromone molecules in the antenna to the generation of the receptor potential in the ORNs. It also focuses on the main post-effector processes, such as the production and degradation of second messengers, the opening and closing of various ionic channels, and the modulation of the effector and channels by various modulators. The model was used to simulate the evolution of chemical species and currents in response to various pheromone doses, and was found to capture the main features of the dose-response curves. The model also made several predictions that can be tested in future studies.
The study of how a tumor suppressor protein called p53 regulates gene expression is important for understanding its function. Researchers have used genome-wide mapping of DNA binding sites for p53 and chromatin structure in human lymphoblastoid cells. They found that p53 binding was correlated with chromatin accessibility and p53RE sequence content. The study also revealed that p53 binding was inversely correlated with evolutionary conservation of p53REs. These findings suggest that p53 binding is influenced by both chromatin structure and evolutionary factors.
The paper by Lukyanov and colleagues from St. Petersburg State University in Russia aimed to understand the signal-response relationship of a specific type of two-component signaling system in bacteria and yeast. In this system, a single histidine kinase (HK) can transfer its phosphoryl group to two separate response regulators (RRs). The authors showed that this one HK-two RR system is able to implement a sigmoidal signal-response relationship, which allows the system to act like a switch that has a threshold level of signal input and sensitivity. They confirmed their findings experimentally by in vitro reconstitution of the chemotaxis pathway of S. meliloti and measuring the resulting signal-response curve. They also found that the level of sigmoidality in this system can be experimentally controlled by the presence of the sink RR and an auxiliary protein that binds to the HK, yielding Hill coefficients of above 7.
When exposed to stress, not all cells within the same population respond in the same way. Some cells survive, while others do not. This is known as cell-to-cell variation in stress tolerance. The causes of this variation are not clear. In this study, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to quantify transcript variation in single yeast cells treated with and without salt stress. They found significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. They also discovered that a subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. The researchers used live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1. They found that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation. The study suggests that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells. Understanding what gives rise to cell-to-cell variation in stress survival has broad applications, including treating pathogenic microbial infections and blocking drug-resistant human metastases.
The parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which is transmitted by tsetse flies, causes African trypanosomiasis. A study has shown that parasites can accumulate in large numbers in the mouse testis, epididymis, and epididymal adipose tissue. This accumulation is associated with severe inflammation and tissue damage. Infected mice have reduced fertility. The study suggests that T. brucei may be transmitted sexually in addition to the previously known mode of transmission through the bite of a tsetse fly.
Drosophila melanogaster, also known as the fruit fly, has a well-characterized chemosensory system, which allows it to detect odors and tastes. This study used customized microarrays to investigate how the expression of chemosensory genes changes under different conditions. The study found that genes within a cluster are independently regulated in males and females, during different developmental stages, and under different physiological and social conditions. Whereas many chemosensory genes showed plasticity in expression, a smaller number of exceptionally plastic genes was evident. Analysis of covariance of transcript levels across all environmental conditions showed that the chemosensory subgenome is structured as a mosaic of 20 small modules of highly correlated transcripts. This finely pixilated modular organization of the chemosensory transcriptome allows finely tuned phenotypic plasticity of expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire under different environmental conditions.
This paper is about how certain kinds of chromosomal errors happen during egg formation in humans. These errors can lead to genetic conditions, such as having an extra chromosome. The authors explain that a special kind of protein called MLH1 helps mark where recombination happens during egg formation. They used this protein to look at how often recombination happens in human eggs and where the recombination happens. They found that recombination happens less often than expected, and that it often happens in places that are more likely to cause chromosome errors. They also found that different chromosomes have different patterns of recombination.
Blood-feeding arthropods like mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks transmit many diseases that cause serious health and economic problems to people worldwide. When these insects bite mammals, they inject saliva that contains immunogenic compounds that help them feed. Some of these compounds can also alter the immune response of the mammal, which can affect the severity of the disease if the mammal is later infected. In this study, the authors created a mathematical model to explore how the immune response to insect bites could affect the spread of vector-borne diseases. They found that increasing the mortality of the insects could either increase or decrease the number of infected hosts, depending on the effect of pre-sensitisation on the duration of infection. The authors conclude that further research is needed to understand the complex ways that insect saliva and host immunity interact and affect the spread of vector-borne diseases.
In this study, the researchers compared the proteomes of amastigotes (the infective form of Leishmania parasites) isolated from two different mice strains (BALB/c and BALB/c nude). They found that there were 44 differentially expressed proteins in the two strains. These proteins were related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases. The researchers also found that some of the proteins were known virulence factors, and that the posttranslational modifications of these virulence factors were influenced by the host immune response. The researchers believe that this study could help identify potential virulence factors and ways of regulating their expression.
This study shows that the protein Activation Induced Deaminase (AID) is controlled by the cell cycle. AID is responsible for changing cytosines to uracils in DNA in activated B cells, which leads to changes in the immune response. The study found that AID is more stable in the nucleus during the G1 phase of the cell cycle than during the S or G2/M phase. Mutations that affect the activity or stability of AID can also affect its abundance in the nucleus. The study used a technique called nuclear localization tags to force AID to be located in the nucleus outside of the G1 phase. The study found that forcing AID to be in the nucleus during the G1 phase increased the rate of changes in the immune response, but did not harm the cells. The study also found that forcing AID to be in the nucleus during the S or G2/M phase was harmful to the cells. The study generated AID derivatives that increased the rate of changes in the immune response with less harm to the cells. The study suggests that the cell cycle can be used to control the amount of AID in the nucleus, which can be useful for engineering genes and proteins.
This research paper presents a new method for analyzing the ability of bacteria to break down different types of plant material. The researchers used a special type of plate called an agar plate to grow different types of bacteria on different types of plant material. They then used a technique called strand-specific RNA sequencing to learn more about the genes that the bacteria use to break down the plant material. They also used a technique called CAZyme assays to learn more about the enzymes that the bacteria use to break down the plant material. The researchers found that different types of bacteria break down different types of plant material in different ways. They also found that some enzymes work better together to break down plant material than they do alone. This information can be used to learn more about how different types of bacteria break down different types of plant material and to develop new ways to use plant material for food and energy.
The paper is about a study on the impact of three rounds of MDA (mass drug administration) on the prevalence and density of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 12 rural health districts of Sierra Leone. The study found that after three rounds of MDA, the prevalence of LF decreased to less than 1% in all but one district, and the overall arithmetic mean mf density decreased by 65.4% among mf-positive individuals and 96.2% for the entire population examined. The study concluded that the prevalence of LF decreased significantly after three rounds of MDA.
The paper discusses the use of high-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, to study the complex microbial communities in the world's oceans and the human gut. The authors describe a common method of analyzing such data by identifying correlations between taxa using correlation analysis. However, they explain that this method may produce unreliable results due to compositional effects. They demonstrate that such effects can be widespread and severe, and suggest that community diversity is a key factor that modulates the severity of such effects. The authors introduce a new approach called SparCC, which is capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data. They use SparCC to infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body and estimate that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data. The authors conclude that SparCC is a reliable and valid method for identifying correlations between taxa in high-throughput sequencing-based microbial communities.
The paper is about how lysozyme, an antimicrobial protein found in high amounts in mucosal surfaces like the upper respiratory tract, kills bacteria. The authors show that two enzymes, PgdA and Adr, are involved in S. pneumoniae's resistance to lysozyme. They show that a mutation in either of these genes increases S. pneumoniae's sensitivity to lysozyme in vitro. The authors then demonstrate the importance of lysozyme and PgdA and Adr in determining the composition of the microflora of the mucosal surface of the upper airway.
The study aimed to investigate the usefulness of using NS1 capture tests to detect the presence of dengue virus (DENV) in human tissue specimens from previously confirmed dengue fatal cases. This study was conducted in Brazil, where approximately 80% of dengue cases occur in the Americas. The goal of the study was to determine the sensitivity of three NS1 capture tests, the first generation Dengue Early ELISA (PanBio Diagnostics), Platelia NS1 (BioRad Laboratories), and the rapid test NS1 Ag Strip (BioRad Laboratories). The researchers analyzed 74 tissue specimens from 23 dengue fatal cases, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, heart, skin, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. The overall diagnosis of dengue based on the tissues analyzed by Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and the NS1 Ag Strip was 34.7%, 60.8%, and 91.3%, respectively. The NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive, with a sensitivity of 78.3%. The study concluded that the NS1 capture assay is a valuable tool for postmortem dengue confirmation and is useful for cases confirmation in an increasing number of dengue hemorrhagic fever and fatal cases.
Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a cancer of plasma cells that affects the bone marrow. It is more common in African Americans (AA) compared to Caucasians (CA) and leads to higher incidence and mortality rates among AA patients. A study used somatic whole exome, RNA-sequencing, and clinical data from 718 MM patients from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study Interim Analysis 9 to analyze the differences in molecular alterations in MM as a function of self-reported race and genetic ancestry. The study found significant differences in mutation frequency between AA and CA cases. The mutations in BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2 were found to be higher in frequency among AA cases while TP53 and IRF4 mutations were more frequent among CA cases. The study suggests that interrogating diverse tumor cohorts is important to understand tumor genomics across populations.
The study aimed to understand the growth of cancer cells and how mutations occur during this process. It focused on neutral mutations (passengers) that do not affect the growth of the cell, but can still provide important information about the timing of cancer evolution. The study used a mathematical model to simulate the growth of a population of cancer cells, taking into account the birth and death of cells and the occurrence of mutations. The model allowed the authors to predict the likelihood of specific evolutionary trees and the number of cancer cells present at a particular point in time. They also derived an equation to estimate the number of subclonal mutations present in a cancer. Fitting this equation to cancer sequencing data led to an estimate of the ratio of birth and death rates of cancer cells during the early stages of clonal expansion. Overall, the study shows that passenger mutations can be used to infer important information about the timing of cancer evolution.
Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the Huntingtin gene. The first exon (XN1) of this gene contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) region that is believed to play a key role in the development of HD. In this study, the authors used molecular dynamics simulations to study the misfolding of XN1 and its role in the development of HD. They created different constructs of XN1 and polyQ homopolymers (Qn) to study the effect of the length of the polyQ region on its misfolding. They found that the probability of XN1 and Qn to form β-rich misfolded states increased as the length of the polyQ region increased. The authors also found that the flanking regions surrounding the polyQ region affect its probability to form a β-rich state compared to the isolated polyQ peptide. They suggest that their findings provide a structural insight of XN1 misfolding and may help to develop strategies to inhibit XN1 aggregation.
The article describes a study of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), a protective system that some bacteria and archaea use to fight against foreign nucleic acids. The study used metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project to analyze the distribution and diversity of known and new CRISPRs in the human microbiome. The researchers developed a new method for reconstructing CRISPR arrays, which allowed them to identify 64 known and 86 novel CRISPRs in the human microbiome. They found that the distributions of CRISPRs are largely body-site specific, and they provided several examples of how CRISPRs can be used to trace rare species and study virus exposure in individuals. The study highlights the importance of identifying and characterizing CRISPR loci in order to better understand the ecology of the human microbiome.
Scientists have found that C. elegans, a type of roundworm that lives in the soil, has a circadian clock. This clock is not as stable or well-known as the clock in other animals, but scientists have found evidence that it exists. They did this by studying the genes that are expressed when C. elegans is exposed to light or temperature changes. These genes are expressed in a rhythmic way that lasts for about 24 hours, which is the length of a day. They also found that this rhythmic expression is stable and can still happen when C. elegans is not exposed to any changes in light or temperature. The scientists also found that the light and temperature changes can cause different groups of genes to be expressed in a rhythmic way, but these groups do not necessarily overlap. They also found that the genes that are thought to be part of the clock are not expressed in a rhythmic way. They also found that a specific type of channel that helps animals sense temperature and light is important for the circadian rhythm in C. elegans. Overall, these findings show that C. elegans has a circadian clock that can be affected by light and temperature changes.
The S. cerevisiae RAD3 gene is a DNA helicase that is part of the TFIIH complex. It plays a role in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Some mutant alleles of RAD3 have partial defects in DNA repair and a strong hyper-Rec phenotype. Previous studies showed that the hyper-Rec phenotype associated with rad3-101 and rad3-102 can be explained as a consequence of persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that are converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. This study further characterizes these events using a system that recovers the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination. Both rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. Mapping of these events shows that three-quarters of these crossovers reflect DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids (double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs). The remainder reflects DSBs formed in single chromatids (single chromatid breaks, SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. A comparison of these data with previous analysis of spontaneous mitotic recombination events suggests that a sub-set of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions, and that DSCBs, which cannot be repaired by sister-chromatid recombination, are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes. The study also found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX, and a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV.
Scientists have found a way to explain how a small genetic change in the bacterium Helicobacter pylori affects the way it binds to human stomach tissue. When H. pylori infects the stomach, it needs to adapt to the changing environment inside the stomach to survive. To do this, the bacterium has a genetic change that allows it to switch on or off the expression of a protein called SabA, which helps the bacterium bind to human stomach tissue. The genetic change is caused by a slip in the DNA strands, which creates different versions of the genetic code for SabA. Scientists have found that the length of the genetic code for SabA controls how much SabA is made and how well the bacterium binds to human stomach tissue. They have also found that this genetic change is common in H. pylori strains from different people.
The JAK-STAT family of proteins are important regulators of the innate immune system. HPVs (human papillomaviruses) are the cause of cervical and other genital cancers, and they must evade the innate immune system to establish infections. HPV proteins downregulate the expression of STAT-1 to allow for stable maintenance of viral episomes. However, this study finds that HPV E7 activates STAT-5 phosphorylation without altering total protein levels. Inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation with the drug pimozide abolishes viral genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating keratinocytes. Knockdown studies show that the STAT-5β isoform is mainly responsible for this activity and that this is mediated through the ATM DNA damage response. A downstream target of STAT-5, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), contributes to the effects on members of the ATM pathway. Overall, these findings identify an important new regulatory mechanism by which the innate immune regulator STAT-5 promotes HPV viral replication through activation of the ATM DNA damage response.
Typhoid fever is caused by the bacteria Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) and Paratyphi A (S. Paratyphi A). It affects over 21 million people each year and can result in death in 200,000 cases. The majority of patients recover from the acute stage of illness and clear infection. However, a small percentage of infected individuals develop a chronic but asymptomatic infection in the biliary tract that can persist for decades. Chronic carriers may act as reservoirs of infection within a community, contributing to the transmission cycle through intermittent shedding of bacteria in feces and introducing S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A into previously uninfected communities. There is currently no reliable diagnostic assay to identify asymptomatic carriers. A study by Klemm et al. aimed to identify potential biomarkers unique to S. Typhi carriers through an immunoscreening technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT). IVIAT identifies immunogenic bacterial antigens expressed in vivo, not in bacteria grown in standard laboratory conditions. The study identified 13 antigens that were immunoreactive in carriers, but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area, including putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. Further evaluation of these antigens could lead to the development of improved diagnostic assays for asymptomatic carriers of S. Typhi and S. Paratyphi A.
Scientists have recently discovered that a wide range of RNA molecules are expressed in eukaryotic genomes. These RNA molecules are called non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and are involved in regulating gene expression. It has also been observed that these RNA molecules are part of epigenetic regulatory networks, which are heritable and have shown surprising evolutionary conservation. In this study, the authors examined the role of cellular RNA pools produced by homologous genomic loci in changing the transcriptional state of a silenced gene. They discovered that non-functional alleles of a white gene, unable to produce a coding transcript, could reactivate in trans the expression of a wild type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochromatin. This new epigenetic phenomenon of transcriptional trans-reactivation is heritable, relies on the presence of homologous RNA's, and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. Overall, the authors found that trans-reactivation is a new epigenetic phenomenon that positively controls gene expression in the context of heterochromatin through homologous RNA molecules.
Ticks and mosquitoes are known for feeding on blood, and they do this by expressing protease inhibitors to prevent the blood from clotting. These inhibitors are found in different parts of their bodies, such as salivary glands and midguts. Boophilin is a protease inhibitor that was identified in the midgut of ticks. It can inhibit the activity of several different enzymes involved in blood clotting, including thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein. It can also block the activity of platelets, which are blood cells involved in clotting. The authors of this study have expressed Boophilin in cells and purified it to study its properties in more detail. They have shown that Boophilin behaves as a non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin, meaning that it binds to the enzyme and prevents it from binding to its substrate. They have also shown that Boophilin can inhibit thrombosis in vivo, meaning that it can prevent blood clots from forming in living animals.
A new model called Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEGMEnT) has been created to understand how the architecture of the intestinal mucosa is influenced by inflammation. The model can be used to understand the role of inflammation as a controller of enteric mucosal tissue patterning and to identify the underlying cellular and molecular dynamics that determine the epithelial crypt-villus architecture across a range of conditions from health to disease. The model has been able to reproduce healthy ileal mucosal dynamics and a series of morphogen knock-out/inhibition experiments. The SEGMEnT model has also been used to investigate two types of potentially pathogenic conditions: acute insults/perturbations and chronic conditions. The model has been able to generate colonic metaplasia of the ileum as seen after surgery for ulcerative colitis by proposing a new link between inflammation and the induction of apoptosis through the Phosphotase and tensin homolog/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PTEN/PI3K) pathway. The SEGMEnT model is a dynamic knowledge representation of a minimally sufficient set of components, mechanisms, and interactions for the maintenance of enteric mucosal architecture (morphogenesis) and the effect of inflammation. The model can be used as a community resource by allowing researchers to instantiate and investigate their own knowledge and try out novel and innovative hypotheses for a range of intestinal diseases.
This study describes the release and evaluation of a Wolbachia strain, wMelRio, in the Brazilian community of Tubiacanga, Rio de Janeiro. The goal of this study was to establish Wolbachia in the local mosquito population to control the spread of arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and yellow fever. However, the previous release of a different Wolbachia strain, wMelBr, was unable to establish in the local population. The study investigated the factors that contributed to the failure of wMelBr, including insecticide resistance. The study also developed a new Wolbachia strain, wMelRio, by backcrossing the wMelBr strain with local mosquitoes to make it more fit and better suited to the local population. The wMelRio strain was then released and successfully established in the local population. The study highlights the importance of matching the genetic background of Wolbachia strains to the local population to ensure successful establishment.
Poxviruses, like other viruses, have sophisticated pathways that control their growth and allow them to infect and multiply in cells. These pathways are controlled by proteins that communicate with each other and regulate cellular defenses. Scientists have recently discovered that a protein called B1 plays a vital role in the vaccinia virus. In this study, researchers have used experimental evolution to search for genes that could take over the function of B1. They found that the B12 gene was able to suppress the B1 deletion phenotype and enhance the fitness of the virus.
The study investigates the folding and aggregation behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKLLKLLKKLLKL (LK) and EAALAEALAEALAE (EALA), with built-in amphiphilic properties upon forming an alpha-helix. The peptides were found to neither form random coils in bulk water nor fully formed alpha-helices, but adopt multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes. Differences in their response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces can be linked to their inherent alpha-helical tendencies in bulk water. The presence of interfaces or an aggregation partner was shown to strongly affect their aggregation behavior and to affect their folding and aggregation equilibria.
Researchers have discovered that human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) can integrate its DNA into the telomeres of human chromosomes. Telomeres are protective caps at the end of chromosomes that help keep genes intact. HHV-6 has two copies of telomeric repeats (TMR) that are similar to human telomeres at the beginning and end of its genome. The researchers used viruses with missing or altered TMR to see if they could still infect and integrate into human cells. They found that the TMR are important for integration to occur. They also discovered that one copy of TMR is more important than the other for integration to happen. This finding could help us understand how HHV-6 infects and integrates into human cells.
The article provides a detailed structural and functional characterization of the Vaccinia Capsid Protein 13 (D13). It highlights the importance of D13 in the assembly of immature virions of vaccinia virus and its ability to remodel lipid membranes. The article also discusses the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly of immature virions.
Auxin is a hormone important for plant growth and development, including root growth and branching. In Arabidopsis thaliana, auxin biosynthesis is essential for root growth, and this biosynthesis requires two genes: TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (TAA1) and TAA1-RELATED (TAR). However, in a monocotyledon plant called Brachypodium distachyon, ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis in an indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA)-dependent manner. This results in sub-optimal auxin levels that are necessary for root cell elongation. In Brachypodium, the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid (ACC) suppresses the root phenotypes, and this is accompanied by down-regulation of the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis. Furthermore, ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis by inhibiting BdTAR2L, which encodes a B. distachyon gene that is homologous to the TAR2 gene in Arabidopsis. This suggests that the wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk is different in Arabidopsis and Brachypodium.
This article discusses how genes evolve at different rates in different species, and how the organization of their promoter nucleosomes affects this. To study this, the authors artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused yeast proteins. They found that both OPN and DPN genes could successfully increase expression by a similar amount, but did so by different mechanisms: OPN genes mostly underwent trans mutations, while DPN genes underwent large-scale duplications. When selection was removed, DPN genes quickly reverted back to their original expression levels, while OPN genes did not. This suggests that promoter organization affects the early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution.
HTLV-1 is a virus that causes a type of cancer called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The virus's main protein, Tax, activates the NF-κB pathway. This pathway is important for the virus to survive and spread. However, Tax also causes cellular senescence, which is a program that stops the cell from dividing. This program is caused by the proteins p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1, which are controlled by NF-κB. The senescence program acts as a checkpoint that stops the NF-κB pathway from becoming overactive. The virus's anti-sense protein, HBZ, can mitigate the senescence program by reducing the activity of NF-κB. This allows the virus-infected cells to continue to divide and persist.
The human brain's frontal lobes are responsible for decision-making and controlling actions. However, existing models of frontal executive function cannot explain how the brain handles changing and uncertain situations, which require exploring and adapting to different strategies. We propose a new model, named PROBE, which can explain these strategies. The PROBE model uses behavioral experiments to test its predictions. We compare the PROBE model to other models, and we find that it can best fit the human data. Moreover, our model suggests that the frontal lobe can monitor up to three or four strategies at the same time, and that new strategies are created if none of the existing strategies is reliable enough. This finding suggests that the frontal lobe has a limited monitoring capacity, but this limitation is compensated by its ability to explore and create new strategies.
In this paper, we present a new modeling approach, called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT), to analyze the long-term effects of a pharmacological treatment. This approach is particularly useful to study biological systems where the network topology is relatively well known, such as metabolic pathways. The concept of time-dependent evolution of model parameters is introduced to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations. The trajectories of model parameters are predicted by identifying necessary dynamic changes in these parameters to describe the transition between experimental data obtained during different stages of the treatment. These trajectories provide insight into the affected underlying biological systems and the molecular events that should be studied in more detail to unravel the mechanistic basis of treatment outcome. We demonstrate how ADAPT can be used to design new target interventions to prevent unwanted side effects.
The authors present a new hypothesis for how the spinocerebellar systems and the cerebellar cortex can interact to support coordination of our multi-segmented limbs and bodies. The hypothesis proposes that the spinal circuitry provides useful recombinations of sensory and motor signals, which can be described as linear projections through aspects of the multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. The cerebellar granule cells potentially with the aid of differentiated thresholding from Golgi cells, enhance the utility of these projections by allowing the Purkinje cell to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. The authors find that random recombination of sensory and motor signals is not a good strategy since the number of granule cells severely limits the number of recombinations that can be represented within the cerebellum. The authors provide a novel view on the function of the spinal circuitry and cerebellar granule layer, illustrating how the coordinating functions of the cerebellum can be crucially supported by the recombinations performed by the neurons of the spinocerebellar systems.
The study aimed to investigate the role of miRNAs in the Aedes albopictus mosquito host during Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection. The study used deep sequencing of small RNA populations in Ae. albopictus Singh's cell line both before and after CHIKV infection. The study identified 88 and 79 known miRNAs in uninfected and CHIKV-infected Ae. albopictus cells, respectively. Additionally, nine novel miRNAs were identified in Ae. albopictus cells. Comparison of the two libraries revealed differential expression of 77 common miRNAs between them. CHIKV infection specifically altered the miRNA profile of eight miRNAs. These miRNAs were predicted to target specific pathways and cellular processes, and the study's findings suggest that the miRNA profile of Ae. albopictus cells can be modified during CHIKV infection. The study's findings also provide insights for identifying potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies.
Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic infection that affects humans and livestock and causes a great deal of medical and economic problems in many countries, including Iran. The aim of the study is to estimate the monetary burden of CE in Iran by using epidemiological and economic data. The study found that the annual cost of CE in Iran was about US$232.3 million, including both direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was estimated at US$93.39 million, while the annual cost associated with CE in livestock was estimated at US$132 million. The cost per surgical human case was estimated at US$1,539. It is important to note that this disease has a considerable economic impact on Iran, with the cost of the disease estimated to be 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. The study recommends the establishment of a surveillance system and a control program for CE to reduce its economic burden on Iran.
The aim of this study is to understand how a virus called mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) affects its host cells. The researchers infected mouse cells with MPyV and used a deep sequencing method to follow the infection over time. They found that MPyV genes are expressed in a specific way and that certain host genes are also affected. The researchers analyzed the changes in the levels of both viral and host transcripts, splicing, and editing that occurs during MPyV infection. At 36 hours after infection, 359 host genes were upregulated and 857 host genes were downregulated. Gene ontology analysis showed that the upregulated genes were mainly involved in metabolism, DNA replication, RNA processing, and translation, while the downregulated genes were mainly involved in transcription regulation, cell adhesion, extracellular matrix, and signal transduction. The researchers also looked at the binding of specific transcription factors to the genes that were upregulated and downregulated. This study provides important information about how MPyV affects its host cells and could help in understanding how to treat or prevent MPyV infection.
This article presents a mathematical model of the energy requirements and fuel use of marathon runners. The model takes into account the runner's aerobic capacity, the energy cost of running at different speeds, and the size of their glycogen stores before and after loading. The model is used to estimate the distance at which a runner will exhaust their glycogen stores and the fastest pace they can maintain over that distance. The model can also be used to determine the optimal pacing strategy for a given runner and to estimate their expected finishing time based on their individual physiological characteristics.
Toxoplasma is a type of parasite that causes toxoplasmosis in humans. There are three main clonal lineages of Toxoplasma in Europe and North America, but in South America many other strains exist. These strains differ in several ways, including their virulence, persistence, oral infectivity, migratory capacity, induction of cytokine expression, and modulation of host gene expression. In this study, researchers infected 29 different Toxoplasma strains, representing global diversity, with murine macrophages and used RNA-sequencing to determine the host and parasite transcriptomes. They found that some strains had large structural variations that had an impact on gene expression levels, and that a few atypical strains induced macrophage type I interferon production, which was associated with parasite killing. This study provides insight into the host response to a large variety of Toxoplasma strains and can form the basis for the discovery of novel Toxoplasma effectors.
The current study presents a new method to better understand how recombination works in viruses. In particular, the authors studied recombination in enteroviruses, a group of viruses that includes polioviruses. Recombination is a way that viruses can change and evolve, and it is an important process for their survival. However, it is not well understood how it works. The authors used a new method to study recombination in enteroviruses, which involves using reverse genetics to create chimeric viruses with duplicated sections. They then used serial passage to study the stability of these viruses and how they evolved. The study found that recombination is a two-step process. First, a chimeric virus is created with a duplicated section. Then, this virus undergoes deletion of the duplicated section, resulting in a viral genome of the expected size. This study provides important insights into how recombination works in positive-strand RNA viruses, and how viruses can evolve over time. The new method used in this study can be used to further study this important process.
The study presents a new approach to fighting obesity by targeting white adipose tissue (WAT) through the use of norepinephrine (NE) to activate the browning of WAT. The researchers discovered that the uptake rate of NE by Oct3 in white adipocytes is the greatest among the known routes of NE clearance. They further demonstrated that adipocytes can clear NE by expressing NE degradation enzymes and reuptake transporter Oct3. When Oct3 is knocked out in adipocytes, the mice show higher body temperatures, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared to control mice. In addition, the researchers found that humans with fewer functional alleles in the OCT3 gene have increased basal metabolic rate. The study suggests that Oct3 can be used as a therapeutic target to combat obesity by promoting the browning of WAT through NE clearance.
The HP1 proteins play a crucial role in regulating the structure and activity of genes in our bodies. These proteins can bind to DNA and regulate the activity of genes. To better understand how HP1 proteins work, researchers are trying to find out more about how they bind to DNA. They have found that HP1 proteins bind to a particular area of the DNA called the nucleosome. However, this binding is not very strong. The researchers also found that the hSWI/SNF complex, which helps to unpack DNA and make it more accessible, can interfere with the binding of HP1 proteins to DNA. This suggests that hSWI/SNF helps to control how HP1 proteins work on DNA.
RNA molecules usually fold into a certain shape to function properly. This folding happens because different parts of the RNA tend to stick together, like pieces of a puzzle. RNAs like miRNAs have the tendency to keep their shape, even when they are cut out of a larger RNA molecule and put into a new location. This property is important for miRNAs because they are made by cutting a piece of RNA out of a larger molecule. The researchers found that miRNAs tend to have this property, while other RNAs don't. They also found that miRNAs from the same family and that are located in different parts of the genome tend to have this property. This property is important because it allows miRNAs to function properly in different locations.
We discovered four new plant transcription factors that control resistance to necrotrophic fungi. These transcription factors are part of a complex signaling system that helps plants defend themselves against pathogens. We found that when any of these four factors are mutated, plants become more susceptible to two different types of necrotrophic fungi, Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. We also identified 77 genes that were commonly up-regulated in the mutants. These genes encode peptides that are secreted outside the plant cell and help the fungi grow inside the plant. We called these peptides "provirus factors." We found that many of the provirus factors are important for disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungi. Finally, we discovered that these provirus factors are localized to the pericellular space, outside of the plant cell.
The endometrium needs to be in a specific state, called the "window of receptivity", to allow for a fertilized embryo to implant and for a pregnancy to be successful. The FOXO1 transcription factor is important for the endometrium to be receptive during this window. FOXO1 is found in the nucleus of the uterine epithelium during the window of receptivity. If FOXO1 is not present, the embryo cannot implant, leading to infertility. The loss of FOXO1 in the uterine epithelium is due to the retention of progesterone receptor (PGR) in the epithelium, which in turn prevents FOXO1 from being present. The loss of FOXO1 in the uterine epithelium causes problems with the apical surface of the luminal epithelium, leading to a failure to allow the embryo to implant. The retention of PGR in the uterine epithelium is due to the loss of FOXO1, leading to a feedback loop. The retention of PGR in the uterine epithelium causes the endometrium to be receptive to the embryo, leading to successful implantation. The loss of FOXO1 in the uterine epithelium causes the endometrium to not be receptive to the embryo, leading to a failure of implantation. FOXO1 is found in the nucleus of the uterine epithelium during the window of receptivity, and the loss of FOXO1 in the uterine epithelium causes the failure of implantation. The loss of FOXO1 in the uterine epithelium leads to the retention of PGR in the epithelium, which in turn leads to the failure of implantation. The retention of PGR in the uterine epithelium causes the endometrium to be receptive to the embryo, leading to successful implantation.
Dengue is a tropical disease caused by the dengue virus and transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. It is endemic in Bangladesh, where it was first reported in 2000. Since then, cases have been reported every year, mostly among adults and older children living in metropolitan cities. Despite no effective control program being introduced and no changes in surveillance until 2010 when serological confirmation was mandated for case reporting, nationally reported cases have declined since 2002. However, there is considerable under-reporting inherent in the passive hospital-based surveillance system. To map the spatial variation in dengue incidence in Bangladesh, we used a negative binomial generalized linear mixed effect model accounting for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal random effects. We found that mean monthly temperature and its interaction with mean monthly diurnal temperature range, as well as mean monthly rainfall at two months lag, were significantly associated with dengue incidence. Densely populated districts and districts bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others. The model estimated that 92% of the annual dengue cases occurred between August and September. We identified districts with 94% of reported cases, but only 409 were reported to authorities. To adjust for under-reporting, we used Bayesian inference to produce maps of monthly spatial variation in dengue incidence at the district-level. These maps can help distribute vector control interventions to areas of highest need at the appropriate time. The method is useful for identifying locations where dengue transmission occurs but incidence data are lacking.
Mice explore their environment and create a map of their surroundings. Sometimes they establish a "home base," a place they visit most often and spend the most time in. Scientists discovered that mice also like to create other special places in their environment. These places are not as well-defined as home bases, but they are still important to the mice. These places are called "knots" because the mice trace twisting and turning paths while exploring them. Knots are usually located near where the mouse first entered the environment and are not like home bases in any other way, except that the mice move faster when they are inbound to the knot and slower when they are outbound. The scientists think that knots help the mice understand their environment and figure out where they are. The scientists discovered that knots are more likely to form when the mice are stressed or aroused, like when they are injected with saline or placed in an exposed area of the environment.
The authors report the discovery of a new antifungal compound, NGx04, which has a dual function. It inhibits the growth of fungi that cause life-threatening infections, such as Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Furthermore, it inhibits the secretion of virulence determinants essential for these fungi to cause infections. The authors used genetics to identify the target of NGx04 and found that it is a lipid transfer protein called Sec14p. The authors showed that NGx04 inhibits the growth of Cryptococcus neoformans and found that related compounds have even higher potency against this fungus. Additionally, NGx04 showed fungicidal activity against a fluconazole-resistant strain of Cryptococcus neoformans. The authors demonstrated that NGx04 inhibits the function of Sec14p in fungi by genetic and biochemical methods. The discovery of NGx04 and its mode of action against Sec14p in fungi is an important step towards the development of new antifungal drugs to treat life-threatening infections caused by fungi.
A recent study tested the antischistosomal properties of mefloquine, a drug used to treat malaria, in mice infected with adult and juvenile worms of two different species of Schistosoma ( S . mansoni and S . japonicum ). Mefloquine was found to have high and comparable reductions in worm burden when given as a single dose to mice with either a sub-patent or patent S . mansoni infection, and even better results were achieved when the drug was given to mice infected with juvenile worms. Both enantiomers of mefloquine were effective in reducing worm burden, suggesting that the drug's activity is not due to its erythro-enantiomer. The study shows promise for the development of a new antischistosomal drug based on an aminoalcohol functionality and further in vitro and in vivo studies have been launched to elucidate the possible mechanism of action and to study the effect of mefloquine on S . haematobium and other trematodes.
Podoconiosis is a disease that causes swelling of the legs due to long-term contact with irritant red clay soil. It is not caused by an infection, but by a combination of environmental, genetic and socio-economic factors. The disease is not well understood, and its geographical distribution is incomplete. In this study, we mapped the distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon to generate data that can help in the global atlas of podoconiosis. We used a multi-stage sampling design and surveyed 76 villages from 40 health districts. We found that the overall prevalence of podoconiosis in Cameroon is 0.5% (95% confidence interval: 0.4-0.7). At least one case of podoconiosis was found in every region of Cameroon, except two surveyed villages in Adamawa. We identified 52 people with podoconiosis using the clinical algorithm. The study has demonstrated the low prevalence but almost nationwide distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon. This finding is important because it will help to design a podoconiosis control program and develop an efficient and cost-effective podoconiosis control and elimination program. The results of the study will help to identify endemic districts and affected communities and will contribute to the global effort to map the global distribution and burden of podoconiosis.
The paper is about how stem cells that make eggs in fruit flies called GSCs get attached to their niche as they age. The niche is a special type of cell that helps GSCs stay stem cells and make eggs. As the fruit flies age, the GSCs start to move away from the niche and eventually disappear. The paper looks at how Notch signaling, a pathway that helps stem cells stay stem cells, changes as GSCs get older and how it affects their attachment to the niche. The paper also shows that Notch signaling in the niche cells, which help keep the GSCs attached, also decreases as the fruit flies age.
The article discusses the conserved herpesvirus-encoded protein kinases (CHPKs), which are proteins that have a similar structure and function across different herpesvirus families. These proteins have been identified as having Cdk-like activity in cells, and the authors describe an experiment where they tested the ability of these proteins to phosphorylate Rb and lamin A/C in human cells. The results showed that all CHPKs from the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus families had this activity, but none of the alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs did. The authors also tested the ability of these proteins to disrupt the nuclear lamina and found that all CHPKs from the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus families had this activity, but none of the alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs did. The authors conclude that the CHPKs from beta- and gamma-herpesvirus families are v-Cdks, while the CHPKs from alpha-herpesvirus families do not have the same functions.
Melioidosis is a rare but serious disease caused by a bacteria called Burkholderia pseudomallei. This bacteria is found in the environment in many tropical countries, but we don't have a good idea of where it is. In order to help prevent melioidosis, we need to know where this bacteria is found. The authors are part of a group of experts who have come together to develop guidelines for how to sample the environment for B. pseudomallei in a standardized way. This will help us create a better map of where this bacteria is found, and what areas we need to be aware of.
The dengue virus has a protein called "E" on its surface that helps it enter cells. The "E" protein is made up of two copies that are attached to each other ("dimer") and have a long, "stem" region that connects two sections of the protein ("domain I" and "domain II"). When the "E" protein is exposed to acidic conditions, it changes shape to form three copies of the "E" protein ("trimer") that are arranged in a special way. Researchers have found that peptides (short chains of amino acids) that are derived from the stem region of the "E" protein can bind to the trimer form of the protein. These peptides also can inhibit the ability of the dengue virus to enter cells by binding to the virus before it reaches the acidic environment of the endosome, which is where the virus usually enters cells. This is important because it shows that targeting a specific step in the fusion process can be an effective way to stop infection.
Cholera is a major global health concern, with 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually worldwide. Recent outbreaks in countries such as Haiti and Yemen highlight the ongoing threat of cholera. Stool specimens preserved on filter paper allow for molecular analysis of Vibrio cholerae, the bacteria that causes cholera, even in remote areas or areas of civil unrest. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) on these specimens provides valuable data on circulating cholera strains, which may inform public policy response on cholera control and elimination. In a proof-of-principle study, the authors demonstrated that DNA extracted from APW-enriched and culture isolate spotted filter paper can generate high-quality accurate sequence data that has the potential to inform public health decisions by providing essential information on cholera genotype and co-infection burden.
The study was focused on identifying the protein network responsible for controlling epithelial polarity. The team found that the Dynein motor is an essential regulator of apico–basal polarity. They showed that Dynein acts through the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Stardust (Sdt) to localize the transmembrane protein Crumbs, in part through the apical targeting of specific sdt mRNA isoforms. They also identified an alternatively spliced coding exon in the sdt mRNA that is responsible for its apical localization, and showed that this switches during development. This study suggests that mRNA localization may have a functional role in the regulation of apico–basal organization.
The paper describes a study on the reproductive cycle of Leishmania, a parasite that causes several dangerous diseases in humans and animals. For many years, scientists believed that Leishmania reproduced mostly clonally, meaning that new generations of parasites were produced from a single parent without any genetic exchange. However, recent evidence suggests that Leishmania may also reproduce sexually, meaning that new generations are produced from the fusion of two different parent parasites. The paper describes a study where researchers created transgenic parasites of Leishmania infantum with two different drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters. They then fed these transgenic parasites to sand flies, the natural vector of Leishmania, along with parental parasites. The researchers found that the sand flies were able to recognize and mate between parasites from the same strain, resulting in yellow fluorescent hybrid progeny. This provides evidence that Leishmania is able to perform genetic exchange between the same genotype during mating. The paper concludes that this study suggests that Leishmania may be able to recognize and mate between parasites with the same genotype, which could have important implications for the spread and evolution of the parasite.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease caused by Leishmania donovani, a parasite that is spread by different vectors in different regions of Ethiopia. Recently, 63 L. donovani strains were studied using PCR and high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis to see if the parasites could be distinguished based on their geographic location. The study found that the k26 region of L. donovani has polymorphisms that can be used to distinguish between different regions, such as northwestern and southwestern Ethiopia. The study also found that the number and order of the repeats in L. donovani varies between geographic regions, which should be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays and vaccines based on this antigen.
HIV-1 is a rapidly evolving virus that can switch between different RNA templates during reverse transcription. Recombination between different subtypes or CRFs (circulating recombinant forms) can create new and potentially more successful viral variants. In this study, the authors create a model to predict the breakpoints of recombination based on local sequence identity. They then compare their model's predictions to the observed breakpoints in the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The authors find that most breakpoints are predicted accurately by their model, suggesting that sequence identity plays a crucial role in determining the recombination breakpoints. However, they also find that some regions have a higher frequency of breakpoints than expected, which may indicate that natural selection is favoring these specific recombinants. The authors suggest that the recombinants generated in these regions may be more successful in evading the immune response or have other beneficial properties.
Computational modeling is an important tool used in neuroscience research to analyze experimental data. However, a key issue in this research is the challenge of estimating individual variation in parameters across a population of subjects while simultaneously comparing models to determine which one provides the best explanation for the data. The authors propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework that addresses both of these problems simultaneously. This framework allows researchers to make inference at the population level, estimate individual variation in model expression, and compare different models. The authors show that the parameters estimated using HBI are more accurate than previous methods, and model comparison using HBI is robust against outliers and not biased towards oversimplistic models. Additionally, the authors show that the HBI framework allows for group-level inference using a t-test, which is not possible using previous methods.
The study by Carlezon and colleagues provides new insights into the role of rhombomeres and their associated Hox genes in the development of auditory circuits in the mammalian brainstem. Rhombomeres are subdivisions of the hindbrain along the antero-posterior axis, where distinct sensory and motor nuclei are generated. The authors used a novel Cre-recombinase driver to create a highly restricted r4-specific fate map, which showed that r4-derived cells contribute significantly to the ventral nucleus of lateral lemniscus (VLL) and the posteroventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN). Moreover, the authors demonstrated that r4-derived cells contribute to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in Hoxa2 mutants, though with different severities. The study also revealed the influence of Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 on the VLL, PVCN, and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB), showing a direct correlation between rhombomere-specific Hox genes and the development of auditory-related neural circuits. The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of Hox genes in the formation of auditory circuits and suggest that rhombomere-specific Hox genes play a crucial role in the development of auditory-related neural circuits in the mammalian brainstem.
The genus Saccharophagus consists of four species that can degrade various complex carbohydrates, including cellulose, xylan, and pectin, and can break down lignin to its constituent monomers. These species are found in marine and estuarine environments and can degrade plant and algal biomass, making them important contributors to the carbon cycle. They also have the ability to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide, making them important players in the fight against climate change. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying their ability to degrade complex carbohydrates.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes viral encephalitis mainly in children. There are five genotypes of JEV, and the most dominant genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to genotype I (GI) over the last 20 years. Scientists used Chinese Culex pipiens mosquitoes as a model to explore if mosquitoes played a role in JEV genotype shift. The results showed that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates, growth kinetics, dissemination rates, and transmission rates. Therefore, JEV genotype shift was not likely to be due to differences in vector competence between GI and GIII viruses.
Dengue fever is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes and mainly affects people in tropical and subtropical areas. In recent years, Malaysia has had several large dengue outbreaks. In this study, we looked at the characteristics of people who died from dengue fever in Malaysia between 2013 and 2014. We found that adults (15-59 years old) and the elderly (60 years old or more) were more likely to have co-morbidities like diabetes and hypertension. Abdominal pain was more commonly observed in adults while lethargy (feeling tired) was more common in children. However, about a quarter of the cases did not show any warning signs. The majority of the deaths were caused by severe plasma leakage, followed by multi-organ involvement and severe bleeding. Overall, we found that dengue fever deaths occurred primarily in adult patients, with severe plasma leakage being the leading cause of death.
Researchers have shown that Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies choose their mates based on traits that reflect their reproductive potential. These traits are thought to be used as cues for mate selection and are assumed to reflect an underlying quality. However, the specific traits that are used for this purpose and how they reflect quality are not entirely clear. The researchers have found that global manipulation of the insulin signaling pathway affects the composition and attractiveness of the female pheromone profile. They have also found that insulin signaling influences the attractiveness of male dung beetles. The researchers believe that flies and beetles have evolved to “read” insulin pathway activity in different forms as an honest and accurate metric of reproductive potential. They are currently dissecting the mechanistic links between insulin signaling, reproduction, and attractiveness by investigating tissue specificity of insulin signaling effects. They have found that global insulin signaling effects on attractiveness come from insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells, whose signals are integrated by pheromone-producing cells called oenocytes. They have also found that manipulations of insulin signaling in the fat body produce opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship with the ovary. All investigated tissue-specific insulin signaling manipulations that changed attractiveness also changed fecundity in the corresponding direction, pointing to insulin pathway activity as a reliable link between fecundity and attractiveness cues. The cues themselves, cuticular hydrocarbons, responded differently to fat body and follicle cell manipulations, indicating independent readouts of the pathway activity from these two tissues. Thus, the researchers believe that the attractiveness of female D. melanogaster fruit flies results from an apparent connection between attractiveness cues and an organismal state of high fecundity, both of which are created by lowered insulin signaling in the fat body and increased insulin signaling in late follicle cells.
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa in 2013–2015 was the largest EVD epidemic ever observed. Our study aimed to investigate the heterogeneous transmission of EVD across the three hardest-hit countries (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) and estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for each affected district and each country. We applied a statistical modeling approach to estimate the R0 based on weekly incident case numbers, growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak, and the reported serial interval distribution. The district-level R0 ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, from 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and from 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone. At the national level, we estimated an R0 of 0.97 for Guinea, 1.26 for Liberia, and 1.66 for Sierra Leone. Our study found that district-level socio-demographic variables related to urbanization, such as high population density and high wealth index, were positively associated with R0, suggesting that the consequences of fast urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the increased spread of EVD. Our study provides valuable insights into the subnational spread of EVD during the 2013–2015 epidemic and highlights potential drivers of EVD transmission.
Protein evolutionary rates vary widely within an organism, and researchers have been trying to understand the factors that determine these rates. In this study, researchers used a large set of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins to analyze the relationship between protein structure and evolutionary rate, as well as the role of protein age. They found that previously observed structural correlations also hold within each age group, including relationships between solvent accessibility and designability and evolutionary rates. However, age modulates the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, tend to evolve faster than older proteins. The researchers also introduce a knowledge-based potential function to study the stability of proteins through large-scale computation. They find that older proteins are more stable and robust to mutations than younger ones. Their results suggest that several factors, both intrinsic and historical, can interact to determine rates of protein evolution.
This paper is about Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a role in controlling gene expression during development and differentiation. PRC2 adds a chemical group to a type of protein called histone H3, which is a building block of DNA. This chemical group helps to keep certain genes turned off. The paper describes a new protein called Pcl3, which is part of PRC2, and how it helps to control gene expression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The paper shows that Pcl3 interacts with the core components of PRC2 and is necessary for PRC2 to function properly. It also shows that Pcl3 helps to recruit PRC2 to certain parts of the genome. The paper concludes that Pcl3 is an important regulator of PRC2 at a subset of target genes.
The article you're referring to presents a study on the regulation of chemoreceptor gene expression in Caenorhabditis elegans (a type of roundworm) as a function of feeding state. The researchers found that basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors work together with MEF-2, a transcription factor known to be regulated by feeding state, to control srh-234 gene expression in ADL sensory neurons. They identified a cis-regulatory MEF2 binding site that is required for the starvation-induced down regulation of srh-234 expression. They also found that HLH-2 (E/Daughterless), HLH-3 and HLH-4 (Achaete-Scute homologs) and HLH-30 (TFEB ortholog) regulate srh-234 expression in ADL neurons. They discovered that MXL-3 (Max-like 3 homolog) acts in the intestine to remotely regulate srh-234 expression in ADL neurons, and that this regulation depends on insulin signaling functioning specifically in ADL neurons. The study suggests that chemoreceptor gene expression is regulated by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous transcriptional mechanisms mediated by MEF-2 and bHLH factors. These findings may help to explain how animals adapt their chemosensory responses to different feeding states.
Buruli ulcer is a skin condition caused by infection with a type of bacteria. The bacteria, Mycobacterium ulcerans, is found in the environment and can be transmitted to humans through biting insects. In this study, researchers tested mosquitoes for the presence of the bacteria and compared it to the incidence of Buruli ulcer in humans in different areas. They found a strong correlation between the presence of the bacteria in mosquitoes and the risk of humans getting Buruli ulcer. This study suggests that mosquitoes may be involved in the transmission of Mycobacterium ulcerans and could help inform strategies to prevent and control the spread of the disease.
The demyelination mutation (dmy) in rats causes severe and progressive myelin damage in the central nervous system (CNS) after myelination is complete. Researchers have now identified the gene responsible for this mutation, Mrs2, and have shown that it encodes a protein that is an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria. This protein is also found in yeast, bacteria, and other organisms. The research suggests that the dmy mutation is a mitochondrial disease, and that the maintenance of myelin in the CNS is dependent on Mg2+ homeostasis in mitochondria.
The article describes how microarray gene expression signatures can be used to diagnose diseases. However, there is a problem with the current documentation standards for these signatures that makes it difficult to apply them to external patients. This hinders their use in clinical practice. The authors analyzed eight publicly available clinical microarray studies and compared the study-internal diagnoses with study-external diagnoses, which were based on documented information only. They found that discrepancies between the two diagnoses can be as frequent as 30% and 18%. They suggest a new documentation strategy that would reduce this discrepancy to 1%. By implementing this approach, the evaluation and use of microarray gene expression signatures in clinical practice can be improved and made more reliable.
A recent study has revealed that extracellular amyloid fibers called curli, produced by Escherichia coli, resemble human pathological amyloids. Curli proteins are made through dedicated cellular processes and play important roles in the biofilm formation of bacteria. In this study, the authors have determined the crystal structure of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit, CsgA, revealing steric zipper fibrils of tightly mated β-sheets. The study also shows that D-enantiomeric peptides, which were originally developed to interfere with Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-β, inhibit CsgA fibrillation and reduce biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. Moreover, the study reveals that as previously shown, CsgA fibrils cross-seed fibrillation of amyloid-β, providing support for the proposed structural resemblance and potential for cross-species amyloid interactions. These findings provide structural insights into amyloidogenic regions important for curli formation, suggest a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms, and hypothesize on the formation of self-propagating prion-like species originating from a microbial source that could influence neurodegenerative diseases.
The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a common cause of encephalitis in Asia. It can result in high rates of death and long-term neurological problems. The epidemiology of JE in the Philippines is not well understood. To help the Philippines decide whether to introduce JE vaccine into their routine immunization program, a systematic literature review was conducted. This review included 29 published reports and presentations from 2011 to 2014. These reports found that JEV was the cause of 7-18% of cases of clinical encephalitis, and that JE predominantly affected children under 15 years of age. Surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 identified 73 cases of laboratory-confirmed JE out of 497 cases tested. This comprehensive review demonstrates the endemicity of JE in the Philippines and supports the use of JE vaccine. Continued and improved surveillance is needed to measure the impact of preventive measures and guide their use.
A new large-scale computational study has been conducted to chart the level of robustness of metabolic networks of hundreds of bacterial species across many simulated growth environments. The study provides evidence that variations among species in their level of robustness reflect ecological adaptations. The results indicate that genetic robustness can be decoupled into two components: an environmental-dependent component and an environmental-independent component. The study identifies reactions that are uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug-targets. The authors conclude that the evolution of genetic robustness is a complex phenomenon that involves various factors, including genetic mutations, environmental variations, and ecological adaptations.
Schistosoma infection has been linked to a reduced immune response to vaccines in children. In this study, researchers wanted to investigate the impact of schistosoma mansoni infection on measles catch-up immunisation and praziquantel treatment on this outcome in a randomised trial. The study was based in Entebbe, Uganda, and included 193 children infected with S. mansoni and 61 uninfected children aged 3-5 years. The researchers found that infected children had lower anti-measles IgG levels and a lower percentage with protective antibody levels compared to uninfected children one week after measles immunisation. However, at 24 weeks after immunisation, there was no difference in IgG levels between the trial groups. Praziquantel treatment was shown to improve the measles vaccine response in S. mansoni-infected children. The researchers concluded that S. mansoni infection may contribute to impaired vaccine responses in endemic populations and that praziquantel treatment may improve the response. This study highlights the importance of considering the impact of helminth infections on vaccine responses and the potential for praziquantel treatment to improve the immune response to vaccines.
The paper presents a new set of tools for studying the evolution of bacterial populations. The authors point out that traditional methods for studying evolution, such as phylogenetic analysis, can have difficulties when there is a lot of recombination in the population. The authors introduce a new algorithm for detecting and representing recombination between populations, as well as a model for describing the shape of a population in sequence space. The authors then use real data from the genus Neisseria to show how their tools can be used to study the evolution of a bacterial population. They also use simulations to demonstrate how their Bayesian approach can handle large databases and complex genetic population structures. The authors emphasize that biological insights are best gained by combining several complementary methods of analysis.
Cortical rhythms, such as those found in the beta frequency band, are thought to play a significant role in our cognitive abilities. Recent studies have shown that top-down beta rhythms, which originate in higher cognitive areas and are delivered to lower areas, can support attentional gain modulation. To understand how beta rhythms achieve this, we built a computational model of sensory cortical areas. Our simulations show that top-down beta rhythms activate ascending synaptic projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3, which are responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow-inhibitory interneurons, which have slow postsynaptic kinetics relative to fast spiking interneurons, are shown to resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate the activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner. The predicted critical roles of these cells in attentional gain provide a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention.
Scientists have developed a new method to estimate the fundamental parameters of an epidemic and make predictions about its trajectory during the initial phase of disease emergence, when the dynamics are stochastic and the data is incomplete. They compared this new method with three state-of-the-art benchmark methods and found that their method outperforms them in most scenarios tested. This new method could be used by public health decision-makers to make better decisions in response to emerging diseases.
Our work investigates how previous stimuli and decisions impact our perception of the present moment. Using multilevel modeling and cross-validation techniques, we found that past decisions have a stronger impact on our perceptions than past stimuli. Specifically, we found that there are two types of serial dependence that are driven by opposite forces: low-level adaptation, which repels our perception away from past stimuli, and past decisions, which attract our perception toward them. These findings suggest that the visual system is anchored and calibrated to the recent history of sensory and decisional events. This provides a new perspective on how previous experiences impact our perception of the present moment.
The Clock-Cycle (CLK-CYC) is a key circadian transcription complex in fruit flies. This complex works by binding to DNA and regulating the expression of target genes. Previous research showed that most of the transcriptional activity of CLK-CYC derives from the glutamine-rich region of its partner CLK. To better understand the role of transcription in circadian timekeeping, scientists have used a fusion protein of the Cyclic protein with the VP16 protein from Herpes virus. This fusion protein has a stronger transcriptional activity than CLK-CYC, and when expressed in fruit flies, it leads to an increase in CLK-CYC direct target gene mRNAs and a shortened period. These results suggest that the timing of transcriptional activation and not the activation itself is the key event responsible for the behavioral effects observed in CYC-VP16-expressing flies. This implies that circadian transcription is important for core circadian function in fruit flies.
In this study, researchers have investigated how a horizontally acquired gene works in different species. The pmrD gene, which helps protect bacteria from the antibiotic polymyxin B, is horizontally acquired in Salmonella enterica. However, this gene does not function in the closely related bacteria Escherichia coli. The researchers found that this is because the PmrB protein, which regulates PmrA/PmrB pathway, has higher phosphatase activity in E. coli than in Salmonella. This difference in the ancestral protein's biochemical activity allows E. coli to survive in low magnesium environments, which is one of the triggers for activating the PmrA/PmrB system.
The differentiation of embryonic stem cells is the process by which they become more specialized cells. To identify the genes that regulate this process, scientists have traditionally compared the gene expression of two cell types (e.g. embryonic stem cells and fully differentiated cells) and identified the genes that are differentially expressed between these two cell types. However, this method can produce a list of genes that are not important to the regulation of the differentiation process. This study shows that instead of comparing two cell types, it is possible to detect genes that regulate the differentiation process by measuring the average gene expression of a mixture of cell types. This is done by using a new statistical test based on variance ratio. The study shows that this method is effective by using biological replicates and validating the results through two experiments.
The functional analysis of gene variants is becoming standard in next-generation sequencing studies, but there are some problems with it. Firstly, many genes have unknown functions and are not well-classified into pathways. Therefore, functional associations between genes are often inferred from large-scale omics data, such as protein-protein interactions and gene co-expression networks. However, these data types can sometimes be affected by confounding factors, which can lead to false positive findings. In this study, we explored the potential confounding factors affecting the implicated genes and found that the genes mutated in the same disease are biased in their coding-sequence length and tend to cluster together, leading to exaggerated p-values in functional studies. We developed a novel method that addresses these bias and found that genes implicated through de novo gene variants tend to cluster more significantly in an integrated phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. We have also presented a tool of superior power to identify functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias and demonstrated the suitability of this method to functionally subcluster the gene variants underlying a polygenic disorder. Overall, this study has important implications for future research in the field of next-generation sequencing studies.
The Mexican government implemented taxes on nonessential energy-dense food and sugar-sweetened beverages in 2014. The study examined the changes in the volume of taxed and untaxed packaged food purchases in response to these taxes in the entire sample and stratified by socioeconomic status. The study used data from household packaged food purchases representative of the Mexican urban population from The Nielsen Company’s Mexico Consumer Panel Services. The findings showed that household purchases of nonessential energy-dense foods declined by 25 g (95% confidence interval = -46 , -11) per capita per month, or a 5.1% change beyond what would have been expected based on pre-tax trends. Low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods than expected, while medium SES households purchased 5.8% less taxed foods than expected. High SES households’ purchases did not change. The main limitations of the study were the lack of a control group, the fact that the study was conducted in urban areas only, the use of only two years of data prior to the tax, and the possibility of underreporting by the household. Overall, the study suggests that the Mexican food and beverage taxes were successful in reducing the volume of taxed food purchases, especially among low SES households.
Power laws are used to describe brain functions at different levels. It is possible that these functions are generated by similar mechanisms. A model was developed that uses a power law to scale inhibitory input to a collision-sensitive neuron, and this model was able to successfully predict response characteristics of the Lobula Giant Movement Detector Neuron. Noise in the inhibitory pathway was critical, but the results were fairly robust against noise in the excitatory pathway. The results suggest that threshold smoothing may also occur at the single neuron level, such as when noisy and thresholded (pre-synaptic) inputs are integrated by the dendritic tree of a neuron.
Buruli ulcer is a skin disease caused by a bacterium that is found in certain parts of Africa, Asia, and South America. The disease causes open sores on the skin and can lead to permanent disfigurement, physical limitations, and social stigma if left untreated. The disease affects people of all ages and both sexes, but mostly children under 15 years old. It is important to diagnose and treat the disease as early as possible to prevent it from worsening and causing serious problems. Buruli ulcer can be diagnosed by trained health workers using simple tools, and it can be treated with antibiotics and surgery. The World Health Organization recommends a specific treatment regimen for Buruli ulcer, which involves using antibiotics to kill the bacteria and controlling the spread of the infection.
In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about how confident people feel when making choices in a learning environment. They found that when people learned to seek rewards, they felt more confident in their choices than when they learned to avoid losses, even though the two tasks were the same difficulty and performance. The researchers think that this might be because of a "context-value" that is learned from the environment. This value is a dynamic estimate of how much people should expect to get from the different choices. They think this could be important in volatile environments, where people need to be flexible with their learning strategies. The researchers also suggest that the bias in confidence that they found might have important consequences for learning and decision-making.
Alphaviruses are a family of viruses that are responsible for a variety of diseases in humans and animals, including Venezuelan equine encephalitis and Sindbis virus infections. The virus is composed of a complex of four nonstructural proteins, one of which is nsP3. The role of nsP3 in the replication of the virus is not well understood, but a recent study suggests that nsP3 interacts with amphiphysin proteins through a specific sequence motif. This interaction is important for the replication of the virus, as mutations in nsP3 disrupting this binding site or the expression of a protein that binds to the same site as amphiphysin both impair viral replication in cells and lead to attenuated virus in mice. These findings provide important insight into the role of nsP3 in the replication of alphaviruses.
Chromoblastomycosis is a skin infection caused by melanized fungi. It is common in humid areas and has been found in several countries worldwide. In Brazil, it is prevalent in rural areas and affects agricultural workers. The most prevalent agents of the disease are Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Fonsecaea monophora, Fonsecaea nubica and Fonsecaea pugnacius. The disease can take several years to develop and can cause disfigurement in severe cases. However, with appropriate treatment, the disease can be effectively controlled.
In this study, we found that Listeria monocytogenes infection of human cells causes DNA breaks. However, the response of the cells to these breaks is only partially activated. We discovered that the toxin Listeriolysin O (LLO) is responsible for this dampening of the response, by degrading one of the key sensors of DNA damage, Mre11. This is an important mechanism for Listeria to replicate successfully in the cells. Our findings reveal a new way in which Listeria monocytogenes subverts the DNA-damage response pathway in host cells.
Herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are common pathogens that cause diseases such as cold sores, blisters, and sexually transmitted infections. During infection, the viruses enter mucosal epithelial cells and nerve termini of sensory neurons. In the cell body, the virus establishes latency, which serves as a reservoir of virus for recurrent infection and transmission to other individuals. Chemicals that inhibit histone deacetylase activity have been reported to enhance viral replication. Inhibition of the histone demethylase LSD1 blocks virus lytic replication and reactivation from latency. Whether other factors of epigenetic regulation have a role in HSV infection is not well studied. In this study, the authors screened a chemical library of epigenetic regulation to identify factors affecting HSV infection. They discovered several BRD4 inhibitors that promoted HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection. BRD4 is an epigenetic reader that recruits transcriptional regulatory complexes to acetylated chromatin and therefore participates in host gene regulation. The authors performed detailed studies and discovered that bromodomain inhibition enhances HSV infection by promoting transcription factor association with HSV gene promoters.
Noma (also known as cancrum oris) is a devastating ancient disease that causes severe facial disfigurement in 140,000 malnourished children every year. The cause of noma is unknown, but it is thought to be a result of a chaotic mix of microbial infection, oral hygiene, and weakened immune system that leads to the development of oral lesions. These lesions are a plausible entry point for unidentified microorganisms that trigger gangrenous facial infections. To understand the microbial ecology of noma, a cross-sectional sequencing study of 16S rRNA gene amplicons was performed on sixty samples of gingival fluid from twelve healthy children, twelve children suffering from noma (lesion and healthy sites), and twelve children suffering from Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG) (lesion and healthy sites). The study revealed that samples taken from lesions in diseased mouths were enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted for Proteobacteria, whereas samples taken from healthy sites of diseased mouths had proportions of Spirochaetes and Proteobacteria that were similar to healthy control individuals. The study did not identify Fusobacterium as a causative agent of noma, but it did find that microbial communities sampled from noma and ANG lesions were dominated by the same Prevotella intermedia OTU. The study also identified several OTUs in the Orders Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales as indicators of noma, suggesting that one or more microbes within these Orders is associated with the development of noma lesions.
The bacterial protein NprR plays a crucial role in the insect-infecting process of Bacillus thuringiensis. It acts as a transcriptional regulator, controlling the expression of genes involved in the bacterium's necrotrophic lifestyle, such as toxin production. In the presence of its cognate signaling peptide, NprX, NprR regulates the expression of at least 41 genes involved in the bacterium's survival in the insect cadaver. Recent research has suggested that NprR may also play a role in the sporulation process. However, the findings are conflicting, with some studies proposing that NprR is a positive activator of sporulation and others indicating that it is a negative inhibitor. In this study, we investigate the role of NprR in the sporulation process and demonstrate that it acts as a Rap-like indirect regulator of sporulation. In the absence of bound peptide, NprR negatively affects the commitment to sporulation by dephosphorylating Spo0F, preventing the initiation of the sporulation process. Furthermore, we show that the dimeric apo form of NprR is highly flexible, similar to the Rap proteins. Our findings suggest that NprX regulates the switch from an indirect sporulation inhibitor function to a transcriptional activator function. This allows for an accurate synchronization of important functions of the cell, such as adaptation properties and cell fate. Overall, our study highlights the importance of NprR in the insect-infecting process of Bacillus thuringiensis, as well as its role in sporulation.
HIV resistance to treatment is a major problem in the fight against AIDS. Computational models can be used to predict the effectiveness of different drugs against HIV mutations. These models can be used to identify new mutations that confer resistance to current drugs and to design more effective treatments for HIV.
The article explains a new way in which eukaryotic cells move towards a source of attractants, such as food or water. The movement is called chemotaxis, and it is an important process for many types of cells, including bacteria, fungi, and animals. The new model describes how cells move using a cycle of pseudopod generation and retraction. These pseudopods are small, branching structures that extend from the cell and help the cell to move. The model suggests that chemoattractants do not directly cause actin polymerization, which leads to pseudopod formation. Instead, they modify the cycle of pseudopod generation and retraction. The article presents data that supports this new model, and it suggests that this model could be used to understand the movement of many different types of cells.
Fleas can transmit plague through two mechanisms: EPT and BDT. The transmission efficiency of fleas varies depending on the species of flea and the host blood source. In a study by Li et al. (2021), fleas were infected with plague bacteria using different sources of rodent blood (mouse, rat, guinea pig, and gerbil) and their ability to transmit the bacteria was assessed. It was found that 10-28% of fleas that consumed rat or guinea pig blood refluxed a portion of the infectious blood meal back into the esophagus within 24 hours of feeding, a phenomenon known as PIER (post-infection esophageal reflux). This reflux was rarely observed in fleas that consumed mouse or gerbil blood. The study also found that fleas that consumed rat blood were more likely to become partially or fully blocked, and to transmit the bacteria through BDT. The findings of this study suggest that the host blood source can influence the transmission efficiency of plague bacteria by fleas.
In this paper, the authors show that positive correlations in the activity of neurons can actually enhance coding performance, in contrast to previous studies suggesting that they are detrimental. The authors show that the probability of discrimination error can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude and the number of stimuli encoded can be enhanced by more than tenfold. These effects are achieved by tuning a few effective parameters and require only a few tens of neurons. The authors also suggest that heterogeneity commonly seen in population activity is beneficial for these effects. They provide experimental tests to identify the pattern of positive correlation that leads to a lock-in limit of perfect coding.
The article describes the development of a cholera vaccine that uses a type of squaric acid chemistry to combine the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1 Inaba strain PIC018 with a heavy chain fragment of tetanus toxin (OSP:rTTHc). This vaccine was tested in mice to determine how the vaccine's OSP content, molar ratio of OSP to rTTHc, effect of an adjuvant, and route of immunization affected the immune response. Immunized mice developed a strong immune response that included serum IgG and intestinal IgA responses, as well as vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses. The study found that the vaccine was effective in a mouse survival cholera challenge model, resulting in 55% protective efficacy. The development of an effective cholera vaccine could be beneficial, especially for children who have difficulty responding to polysaccharide antigens.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a disease caused by parasites called filarial worms that are spread through mosquitoes. The World Health Organization (WHO) has set a goal to eliminate this disease by 2020. However, this goal is hard to achieve because it is difficult to accurately identify areas where the disease is present. One way to identify areas where LF is present is by using a test called the Immunochromatographic Card Test (ICT). In this study, researchers used the ICT to map the distribution of LF in areas with different levels of loiasis and mansonellosis in Cameroon. They found that the ICT was more likely to give a positive result in areas with high levels of loiasis than in areas with low levels of loiasis. They also found that the ICT was not likely to give a positive result in areas with high levels of mansonellosis. The researchers concluded that the ICT is useful for identifying areas where LF is present, but it is important to consider the levels of other parasites that may cause cross-reactivity when interpreting the results.
The article describes the use of electron tomography to study the ultrastructure of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) in cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). DMVs are structures that have been implicated in viral RNA synthesis. The study shows that DMVs are not isolated vesicles, but are integrated into a network of modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes. This network includes structures with convoluted membranes that are not thought to be involved in viral RNA synthesis, raising questions about the actual site of SARS-CoV-2 RNA synthesis.
This article describes a new genetic study that found a link between the chemical barrier suberin in plant roots and water and mineral uptake in shoots. The study used the newly identified esb1 mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana, which has increased suberin content in roots. The results showed that esb1 mutants had reduced water loss through transpiration, increased water-use efficiency, and altered accumulation of various minerals in the shoot. The authors presented direct evidence that suberin in roots plays a critical role in controlling both water and mineral uptake and transport to the leaves. The study also highlighted the importance of suberin in regulating the apoplastic transport of water and minerals in the root.
The study investigates the sources of variability in the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction. The authors used a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) based on the biochemistry of rhodopsin activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. They found that the randomness of the sojourn times of R* in each phosphorylation state is responsible for the variability of the photoresponse, while the randomness of the number of R* turnoff steps has a negligible effect. The study suggests that R* shutoff is responsible for the variability of the photoresponse, while the diffusion of the second messengers acts as a variability suppressor. The authors also report that mutant mice with variable numbers of phosphorylation sites reproduce the WT response, with the same set of parameters.
The dynamics of cellular processes are often affected by factors outside the process itself. In this work, the authors develop a general framework to account for such extrinsic factors by incorporating only their effects on the process into a new model. They derive corresponding process and master equations, allowing for stochastic simulations, and demonstrate the significance of their approach through several case studies. The resulting model accounts for intrinsic noise and extrinsic noise, and is self-exciting. The authors previously developed a similar approach for the case of constant but random environmental conditions. In this work, they extend their approach to include dynamically changing environments.
Researchers have developed a novel closed-loop BMI training architecture that allows for processing, control, and adaptation using spike events, enabling robust control and extending to various tasks. The architecture incorporates an infinite-horizon optimal feedback-control ( OFC ) model of the brain’s behavior in closed-loop BMI control, and a point process model of spikes. The OFC model infers the user’s motor intention during CLDA—a process termed intention estimation. OFC is also used to design an autonomous and dynamic assisted training technique. The point process model allows for neural processing, control, and decoder adaptation with every spike event and at a faster time-scale than current decoders; it also enables dynamic spike-event-based parameter adaptation unlike current CLDA methods that use batch-based adaptation on much slower adaptation time-scales. The researchers conducted closed-loop experiments in a non-human primate over tens of days to dissociate the effects of these novel CLDA components. The results show that the OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared with current intention estimation techniques, OFC assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control, and spike-event-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared with batch-based methods. The architecture also extended control to tasks beyond those used for CLDA training. These findings have significant implications towards the development of clinically-viable neuroprosthetics.
The retina, like other parts of the brain, uses a clever way to process information that comes in from the eye. This involves using some of the signals that come in from different parts of the retina to create a representation of what's being seen. However, the way that these signals are processed and combined can change depending on what is being seen. In this study, researchers wanted to understand how changes in what's being seen would change the way that the retina processes this information. To do this, they presented different kinds of images to the retina and looked at how the signals coming out of the retina changed. They found that when the retina saw images that were more structured and had more patterns in them, it changed the way that it processed the information that it was getting from different parts of the retina. This meant that the retina was able to keep the same amount of information about what was being seen, even when the image changed. This could be important for helping the brain to understand what's being seen, even when the input changes.
A recent study focused on predicting genetic interactions in yeast, which are important for understanding how genes work together to cause diseases. The authors developed a new approach that predicts these interactions by using a wide range of different features and machine learning techniques. The results of this study showed that their approach was more effective than existing methods, and that it could be applied to other organisms as well.
The BRCA Challenge project is a collaboration between the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) and a group of research institutions to create a comprehensive data exchange platform for BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. The platform, called the BRCA Exchange, aims to provide a single source of truth for variant annotations in these genes, which can be used to improve clinical care and research. The BRCA Exchange is designed to be a global resource, and it is currently available to the public.
Malaria, a disease caused by a parasite, is a threat to human health and causes about one million deaths each year. The parasite needs to defend itself against a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are produced during its developmental cycle in humans and mosquitoes. Plasmodium, the apicomplexan parasite that causes malaria, is able to maintain a balanced redox state by using various redox-related proteins. In this study, we investigated the subcellular localization of the major redox-related proteins in Plasmodium falciparum, which causes the most dangerous form of malaria. We found that a number of these proteins are targeted to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid in the parasite. Additionally, we discovered that some of these proteins are targeted to different subcellular compartments by using an alternative-translation-initiation (ATI) mechanism. This suggests that dual targeting of proteins is a common phenomenon in apicomplexan parasites, and may be a potential target for new antimalarial drugs.
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are involved in a wide range of critical physiological processes. The discovery of IDPs has led to the need for new approaches to understanding protein-protein interactions. Many of these interactions are coupled with protein folding. Coarse-grained simulations have been used to investigate these processes. Here, we used a coarse-grained simulation model, with an explicit Debye—Hückel charge model, to study the importance of electrostatic interactions in the binding of PUMA and Mcl-1. We found that intramolecular electrostatic interactions affect the unbound states of PUMA only marginally. We also found that intermolecular electrostatic interactions play a role in the formation of the initial encounter complex. Our findings suggest that non-native electrostatic interactions are important for understanding the binding of IDPs.
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain gene silencing in embryos. These proteins are found in distinct nuclear structures called PC bodies that contain PcG-silenced genes. PC bodies are formed at early embryogenesis and move around the nucleus, with both fast and slow motions. This motion likely reflects interactions between PcG proteins and other nuclear components that are important for maintaining stable gene silencing.
This study aimed to determine the most accurate method for measuring somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in mice. The study found that mice with a mutated mtDNA polymerase had 10 times more mtDNA point mutations and an increased amount of linear mtDNA deletions compared to their wild-type siblings. However, the study found no increase in mtDNA mutations with age in normal mice, suggesting that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur during development and not in adult life. The study also refuted the popular notion that increased levels of oxidative stress lead to more mtDNA mutations, as the mtDNA mutator mice had no or minor increase in oxidative damage despite a severe decline in mitochondrial function. The study used ultra-deep sequencing to accurately measure mtDNA mutations in mice, providing valuable information on the role of mtDNA mutations in aging and mitochondrial function.
Fusobacterium nucleatum is an anaerobic bacteria that makes energy by using glutamate to generate a sodium-motive force (SMF) across the cell membrane. This SMF is used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in a process called ATP synthesis. In this study, we wanted to understand how the bacteria uses the SMF to make ATP. We found that the bacteria has a unique way of recognizing sodium ions (Na+) and that it uses many sodium ions to make one ATP molecule. We also found that this bacteria is different from other bacteria because it has two carboxyl groups that recognize sodium ions, instead of just one. This means that the bacteria has a unique way of using the SMF to make ATP. Our findings will help us understand how this bacteria makes energy and how it can be targeted for treatment.
T cell immunity is essential for fighting off pathogens and tumors. In order for T cells to recognize and respond to a foreign substance (such as a virus or cancer cell), T cells need to bind to that substance through a specific molecule called a major histocompatibility complex (pMHC). The strength of the T cell's binding to the pMHC is influenced by several factors, including the strength and length of the TCR/pMHC interaction. However, it is unclear how these factors affect T cell responses in vivo. To study this, researchers used mice and a special type of T cell called 5C . C7 T cells to examine the relationship between TCR/pMHC interaction parameters and in vivo T cell responses. The researchers found that optimal T cell responses occur to ligands with intermediate binding characteristics. This means that a T cell response is strongest when the T cell and the pMHC interact for a moderate amount of time. This information can be useful for designing vaccines that trigger strong, long-lasting T cell responses.
Fusarium solani is a type of fungus that is part of a group called the Fusarium solani species complex. Members of this complex have different characteristics, including the ability to infect over 100 different types of plants and people. Scientists have studied a specific type of Fusarium solani called Nectria haematococca, which is found in many different environments such as forests, deserts, and even caves. This fungus has extra chromosomes that contain genes that help it live in different environments. The DNA of this fungus has been sequenced, and scientists have found that it has a large genome, meaning it has a lot of genes. Some of these genes might have been acquired from other organisms through a process called horizontal gene transfer. The DNA sequence of this fungus can help scientists understand how it is able to survive in many different environments and how its genes have evolved.
We developed a new method to watch how the herpesvirus PRV (pseudorabies virus) leaves infected cells. We used live-cell fluorescence microscopy to track individual viral particles, and found that they move in small acidified vesicles towards the plasma membrane. We also found that certain Rab proteins are involved in the transport of these viral particles, and that they exit the cell by exocytosis near patches of LL5β, a protein complex that connects microtubules to the plasma membrane. This study helps us better understand the final steps of alpha herpesvirus egress.
Scientists have been studying the association between pinworms and allergies and autoimmune diseases, but the results have been contradictory. A new study was done to understand how exposure to pinworms and the drug mebendazole affect the gut microbiota and immune responses. The study recruited 109 primary school children in Taichung, Taiwan. In this study, the children were divided into two groups: one group was pinworm-negative, and the other group was pinworm-positive. In the pinworm-positive group, fecal samples were collected again two weeks after they took mebendazole to deworm the pinworms. The study found that exposure to pinworms and mebendazole increased the diversity of gut bacteria, and it also increased the abundance of the probiotic bacteria Bifidobacterium. The study also found that exposure to pinworms and mebendazole decreased the proportion of the bacteria Fusobacteria. The study also found that the gut level of a protein called secretory IgA (SIgA) was lower in the pinworm-positive group and was increased in half of the individuals after they took mebendazole. The study suggests that childhood exposure to pinworms and mebendazole can change the composition of gut bacteria and may have a protective effect on the development of allergies and autoimmune diseases.
A recent study examined the genetics of Arabidopsis thaliana root length and found that the genomic narrow-sense heritability for this trait in the examined population was statistically zero. This means that most genetic variance is not additive, and therefore, could not be captured by a standard additive model-based genome-wide association analysis. To map loci contributing to the epistatic genetic variance, the researchers performed an epistatic GWA analysis. They identified four interacting pairs of loci, involving seven chromosomal loci that passed a standard multiple-testing corrected significance threshold. The genotype-phenotype maps for these pairs revealed epistasis that cancelled out the additive genetic variance, explaining why these loci were not detected in the additive GWA analysis. The researchers estimated that half of the associated pairs were true positive associations. They used a combination of careful statistical epistatic analyses and functional genetic experiments to support their estimate. The study provides new insights into the value of epistatic GWA analyses for dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits in small, inbred populations.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations are a common cause of human diseases. These mutations occur multiple times around the world and are strongly associated with specific mtDNA haplogroups. A study analyzed the characteristics of 30,506 mtDNA sequences from different parts of the world. The study found that the pathogenicity of mtDNA mutations is different in different mtDNA macro-haplogroups. Some mutations were found on specific clades, while others were found on different clades. The study also found that mutations that recurred only within the same phylogenetic cluster were more common than expected by chance. The study provides an explanation for the low frequency of mtDNA diseases reported in specific ethnic groups. The findings of the study highlight the importance of mtDNA background in recurrent mutation events that have been purified through natural selection in older populations.
In cancer, embryonic development, and wound healing, cells can move together in a coordinated way, known as collective migration. To study how these cells interact with each other, researchers use a technique called contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), where the velocity of pairs of cells is measured before and after collision. Recently, 1D collision assays have been developed to study cell-cell collision outcomes, where cell motion is restricted to a micropatterned stripe. The goal of this study is to use a computational model of collective cell migration, incorporating the mechanics of cell shape and a minimal chemical model for CIL, to reproduce the different outcomes seen in 2-cell collisions. The model identifies the parameters that control these transitions, including cell-cell adhesion, propulsion strength, and the rates of CIL. These parameters suggest hypotheses for why different cell types have different collision behavior and the effect of interventions that modulate collision outcomes. The authors identify the key properties of cell-cell interactions that are responsible for the different outcomes seen in experiments.
A study published in the journal "Biochemistry" explains the mechanism of thioredoxin-disulfide exchange reactions. The authors used molecular dynamics simulations, pKa calculations, and reactivity analysis to study the reaction between thioredoxin (Trx) and its endogenous substrate, arsenate reductase (ArsC). Specifically, they focused on the mechanism of Trx mixed disulfide complex dissociation, which involves the activation of the nucleophilic cysteine of Trx and the regioselectivity of the nucleophilic attack on the intermediate disulfide complex. The authors observed that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx into contact with Cys29Trx, and that Cys32Trx is activated for its nucleophilic attack by hydrogen bonds. They also found that Cys32Trx directs its nucleophilic attack on Cys29Trx, not on Cys89ArsC. This multidisciplinary approach provides new insights into a key thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism.
This study shows that people can change their preferences based on what they see others preferring. This change in preferences is thought to be caused by uncertainty about what people prefer, rather than by a desire to conform to others or by other social factors. To study this effect, the study looked at how people choose between rewards that are available now or later. The study found that people change their preferences for these rewards based on what others prefer, and that this change is better explained by uncertainty about what people prefer than by other social factors. The study also found that people become more certain about what they prefer after seeing what others prefer. This study has important implications for understanding how people make decisions and how their preferences can change based on the preferences of others.
Filamentous growth is a complex differentiation response in yeast that occurs under specific conditions and is regulated by multiple pathways. In this study, we developed a new approach to identify regulators of the pathway that controls filamentous growth. We found that many of the major regulatory pathways (such as RAS, RIM101, OPI1, and RTG) were required for the activation of the MAPK pathway, which controls filamentous growth. This indicates that the pathways that control filamentous growth are connected in co-regulatory circuits, which is a systems-level coordination of this differentiation response. This finding is significant as it provides insight into how different pathways are integrated during complex behaviors.
The article explains how gene expression changes can be important in the evolution of different body shapes in fungi. The study was done by examining gene expression levels in different stages of development in five fungi species in the Sordariomycetes. This helped identify genes that play an important role in the development of fruiting bodies. The knockout of these genes in two different species was then performed to see if it had any impact on fruiting body development. The findings of the study suggest that the evolved increase in gene expression across different developmental stages is a key factor in the evolution of different body shapes in fungi. The study also shows how genetic networks can be used to understand the development of fruiting bodies. The study's findings can help us understand how gene expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms evolve to create new body forms.
The egg of a parasite is a good place to put new genetic material into. This is because there are a lot of germ cells (which can make babies) in eggs, and you can also infect snails with miracidia that hatch from eggs. It's also good because eggs are easily available from infected rodents, and they have a high ratio of germ cells to other types of cells. We wanted to see if we could put new genetic material into the eggs of the schistosome worm (S. mansoni) using a method called square wave electroporation. We wanted to use this method because it has been successful in other organisms. We first put new genetic material into the eggs and then exposed them to electric pulses. We looked at the eggs under a microscope to see if the new genetic material had been put in. We also exposed the eggs to virions (which are like little bags of genetic material) and looked to see if those had been taken up by the eggs. We found that the eggs had taken up the new genetic material better when they were exposed to electric pulses, and we were able to detect the genetic material that had been put in. This means that square wave electroporation could be a good way to put new genetic material into the eggs of the schistosome worm.
The paper describes a new approach called the Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model to study the dynamic response of the chaperone complex in Escherichia coli. The model is used to analyze details of the time trajectories of residues upon perturbation. The authors describe how the model works, and the predictions that can be made using the model. They then use the model to study the GroEL-GroES protein chaperone system, and the predicted residues are compared with experimental studies to validate the model's predictions. The authors conclude that the PMT model is useful for studying the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies.
Fungal galectins are proteins that have a role in defense against predators by binding to specific carbohydrate signatures displayed on the cell surfaces of these organisms. In this study, we found that a mushroom galectin, Coprinopsis cinerea CGL2, was toxic to Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes. This toxicity was dependent on the interaction between CGL2 and a specific carbohydrate on the nematode's N-glycans. We identified a novel putative glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of this glycoepitope. We also found that the nematode's resistance to CGL2 was dependent on its ability to produce GDP-fucose, a carbohydrate building block. These findings suggest that fungal galectins may play a role in the defense of fungi against predators by binding to specific carbohydrate signatures displayed on the cell surfaces of these organisms.
HIV reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells have been extensively studied in terms of treatment and eradication. However, the impact of these reservoirs on the evolutionary dynamics of the virus during untreated infection has received little attention. Here, we present a within-host quasispecies model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir. We find that the presence of a latent reservoir can severely delay evolutionary dynamics within a single host, with longer delays associated with larger relative reservoir sizes and/or homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. These delays can fundamentally change the dynamics of the virus at the epidemiological scale. In particular, the delay in within-host evolutionary dynamics can be sufficient for the virus to evolve intermediate viral loads consistent with maximising transmission, as is observed, and not the very high viral loads that previous models have predicted, an effect that can be further enhanced if viruses similar to those that initiate infection are preferentially transmitted. These results depend strongly on within-host characteristics such as the relative reservoir size, with the evolution of intermediate viral loads observed only when the within-host dynamics are sufficiently delayed. In conclusion, we argue that the latent reservoir has important, and hitherto under-appreciated, roles in both within- and between-host viral evolution.
This article describes how some viruses, including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), can evade immune responses from the body. The authors found that while most viruses induce strong immune responses, CVB3 evades CD8+ T cell immunity by almost completely inhibiting the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. In contrast, MHC class II presentation is relatively unencumbered and CVB3 induces primary and memory CD4+ T cell responses. The authors also describe the quantity and quality of these memory CD4+ T cells, which are induced by CVB3 infection. These findings have implications for the efficiency of cross-priming during CVB3 infection.
This paper is about a medical study that looks at treating a condition called leprosy type 1 reactions, which can cause nerve damage and disability. The study wanted to see if a higher dose of a medicine called methylprednisolone could be more effective in treating leprosy type 1 reactions. They did this by comparing a group of people who received three infusions of high-dose methylprednisolone at the start of their treatment with a group of people who only received a standard dose of prednisolone. The study found that the group who received high-dose methylprednisolone was less likely to experience deterioration in nerve function over the course of the study. However, there were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement at the end of the study. The study also found that about half of the people who received the treatment needed more prednisolone to treat their leprosy type 1 reactions, despite receiving a standard 16-week course of corticosteroids. The study provides further support for the use of more prolonged courses of corticosteroid to treat leprosy type 1 reactions and the investigation of risk factors for the recurrence of type 1 reaction and nerve function impairment during and after corticosteroid treatment.
CD8 T cells are important for controlling viral infections. HIV-specific CD8 T cells are involved in the response to HIV infection but have failed to clear the virus in most infected people. Chronic viral infection and ongoing antigenic stimulation can lead to exhaustion of virus-specific T cells by engaging down-regulatory mechanisms, such as the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) pathway. HIV-specific CD8 T cells have a decreased proliferative capacity, incomplete differentiation, and reduced cytotoxic ability as compared to CD8 T cells specific for non-progressive persistent infections, such as EBV or cytomegalovirus. Several studies have suggested a particular role for the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in the exhaustion of HIV-specific CD8 T cells. In this paper, the researchers investigated the inhibitory effects of Treg on CD8 responses in chronic HIV infection. They found that Treg from HIV-infected patients (Treg/HIV+) did not significantly inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell function, suggesting either a defect in the suppressive capacity of Treg/HIV+ or a lack of sensitivity of effector T cells in HIV infection. Results showed that Treg/HIV+ inhibited significantly the IFN-γ expression of autologous CD8+ T cells stimulated with recall CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) antigens, but did not inhibit HIV-Gag–specific CD8+ T cells. In cross-over cultures, the researchers showed that Treg/HIV- inhibited significantly the differentiation of either CEF- or Gag-specific CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected patients. The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was higher on Gag-specific CD8+ T cells as compared to CEF-specific CD8+ T cells, and the expression of these markers did not change significantly after Treg depletion or co-culture with Treg/HIV-. In summary, the researchers showed a defect of Treg/HIV+ in modulating both the differentiation and the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules on HIV-specific CD8 T cells. Their results suggest that this particular defect of Treg might contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cell responses.
Lymphatic filariasis is a serious and disabling disease caused by parasites that live in the lymphatic system of humans for years. The parasites produce molecules that neutralize the effects of the host's immune response. These molecules are called glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). GSTs from other parasites, such as schistosomes and fascioliasis, have been used in vaccines to protect against infection. In this study, the authors have cloned the GST gene from the larval stage of the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti, expressed it in the lab, and tested it as a potential vaccine candidate. They found that the antibodies produced by vaccinated animals could inhibit the enzymatic activity of the GST, and that these animals were partially protected against infection with a related parasite. The authors suggest that further studies should be done to improve the vaccine's effectiveness and explore its potential for use in humans.
CRISPR-Cas9 is a new technology that allows scientists to edit the DNA of experimental organisms. It also has huge potential for therapeutic purposes. However, there is concern about the possibility of "off-target effects" caused by poor editing fidelity. To address this concern, scientists have used whole genome sequencing to look for new mutations that may have been caused by the editing process. However, these studies used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls, meaning that they couldn't tell the difference between true mutations and those caused by other factors. In this study, the researchers used a "trio design" and whole genome sequencing to look for mutations caused by CRISPR editing in embryos. They also looked at the number of these mutations and found that it was not statistically different from the number of mutations that occur naturally in embryos. This means that if CRISPR editing is causing off-target effects, it's likely not happening very often.
Photosynthesis and water use are influenced by the size of stomata, which are tiny holes on the surface of plant leaves that help plants take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen. The size of stomata can be controlled by exposure to light, with blue light causing stomata to open and red light causing them to close. Two proteins, HRB1 and PP7, play important roles in this process and help to control the opening and closing of stomata in response to changes in light intensity. Mutations in either HRB1 or PP7 can affect the normal functioning of stomata, leading to changes in water use and photosynthesis. Researchers have studied the interactions between these two proteins and how they work together to regulate stomatal opening.
The article is about a protein called Mediator, which helps with gene expression in eukaryotes. Mediator works together with many other proteins to help RNA polymerase produce a copy of the gene. In a previous study, the authors found that a specific Mediator protein, called MDT-15, helped control certain metabolic genes in a specific way. Now, they are studying the function of MDT-15 in more detail to understand how it works and what other genes it affects. The authors did a new study to find new genes that MDT-15 affects. They discovered that MDT-15 affects many genes that are not related to metabolism, but are important for response to stress. The authors suggest that MDT-15 may be a key link between gene regulation and metabolism.
The hippocampus, a brain structure that's essential for spatial memory, encodes spatial information by creating "mental maps" of environments. These maps are thought to be encoded in the patterns of spiking across many neurons, and the resulting information needs to be decoded accurately to form a spatial map of the environment. It is believed that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, specifically co-firing, is key to decoding this information. The authors propose that co-firing implies spatial overlap of place fields, meaning that the map encoded by co-firing will be based on connectivity and adjacency, or topological, rather than geometric, information. Using computational tools from algebraic topology, the authors demonstrate that it is possible to effectively and reliably derive a topological connectivity map from neuronal spiking patterns. They show that there are certain requirements for the firing activity to produce a stable topological map, and they propose that the experimentally observed characteristics of firing activity likely satisfy these requirements. The authors conclude that a topological connectivity map is a plausible mechanism for decoding place cell firing patterns and forming a spatial map of the environment.
A research paper has been published about the production, assembly, and secretion of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in cells. The researchers identified many new host factors required for HCV egress and used live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking to study the dynamics of HCV core trafficking in association with its cellular cofactors. The study used infectious HCV with a tetracysteine (TC) tag insertion in core (TC-core) to monitor the dynamics of HCV core trafficking in association with its cellular cofactors. The researchers found that HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. They also found that dynamic HCV core trafficking in association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and vesicles is important for HCV egress. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of HCV egress and suggests potential targets for antiviral therapies.
In this article, the authors investigate the role of the imprinted gene Grb10 in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder characterized by an increased risk of developing benign and malignant tumors. The authors used mutagenized mice heterozygous for NF1 to model radiation-associated second malignant neoplasms. They found that Grb10 is commonly lost in diverse Nf1 mutant tumors, and that this loss independently promotes Ras pathway hyperactivation, which promotes hyperproliferation. The authors also found that restoring Grb10 in Nf1 mutant tumors decreases proliferation and downregulates Ras signaling, and that Grb10 silencing in untransformed mouse embryo fibroblasts significantly increased cell proliferation and Ras-GTP levels. These findings suggest a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis, and highlight the need for further research on the role of imprinted genes in cancer.
Pavlovian threat conditioning is a way that animals learn to associate neutral stimuli with dangerous outcomes. This process is similar to learning a new language or a new skill. A new skill takes time and effort to master, and it is not easy to learn. The brain has a mechanism that helps it to learn from experiences, just as it helps to learn a new skill. This mechanism is called learning. In the case of Pavlovian threat conditioning, the brain uses learning to associate a neutral stimulus with a dangerous outcome. This can help the animal to react to danger quickly and effectively. It is not clear how the brain uses learning to associate a neutral stimulus with a dangerous outcome. There are many different theories, and scientists have studied this for a long time. In this study, scientists wanted to learn more about how the brain uses learning to associate a neutral stimulus with a dangerous outcome. They did this by looking at how the autonomic nervous system (ANS) responds to different stimuli. The ANS is responsible for the body's automatic responses, such as heart rate, breathing, and sweating. Scientists used a method called PsPM (psychophysiological modelling) to measure the ANS responses of study participants. PsPM uses all of the data from the ANS response, not just a few specific data points. This method allows scientists to get a more accurate picture of the ANS response. Scientists also looked at different models of how the brain uses learning to associate a neutral stimulus with a dangerous outcome. They compared these models to the ANS responses of study participants. They found that a probabilistic learning model best explained the ANS responses of study participants. This means that the brain uses probabilistic learning to associate a neutral stimulus with a dangerous outcome. The study also found that different ANS responses reflect different aspects of the same learning model. This means that different parts of the ANS respond differently to the same learning process. Overall, the study provides new insights into how the brain uses learning to associate a neutral stimulus with a dangerous outcome.
The SepH-SIN protein kinase cascade plays an essential role in septation (separation of hyphal cells) and conidiation (asexual reproduction) in the filamentous fungus A. nidulans. However, whether negative regulators of conidiation exist is unknown. In addition, the SepH-SIN kinase cascade and the HOG-MAPK pathway, which are involved in regulating reversible protein phosphorylation and are required for cell growth and reproduction, may communicate with each other. Using mutation comparison analysis of next-generation sequencing, we identified a suppressor of SepH, PomA, which is involved in septation and conidiation. Furthermore, deletion of pomA causes activation of the HOG-MAPK pathway. These findings demonstrate that the SepH-SIN cascade and the HOG-MAPK pathway interact with each other and play important roles in cell growth and reproduction.
Leishmaniasis is a skin disease caused by a parasite and is endemic in many parts of the world, including Brazil. There are different types of leishmaniasis, and some people can develop more severe forms of the disease. The reasons why some people develop more severe forms of the disease are not fully understood. A study was done to investigate the relationship between the different species of Leishmania that cause leishmaniasis and a virus that can affect the parasites. The study included 156 patients with leishmaniasis who attended a hospital in Brazil. The researchers found that the virus was present in the parasites causing leishmaniasis, but it did not seem to be the only factor that determined whether someone would develop a severe form of the disease.
This study showed that type I interferon (IFN-I), which is known to help fight viral infections, also plays an important role in preventing pneumococcal bacteria from invading the bloodstream after infecting the lungs. This is done by reducing the ability of the bacteria to travel through the lung and blood vessel walls, as well as by reducing the number of bacteria that can invade the bloodstream. The study found that IFN-I accomplishes this by increasing the strength of the tight junctions that hold the cells of the lung and blood vessel walls together, and by decreasing the ability of the bacteria to use a protein called PAF receptor to invade those cells. The study also showed that giving mice a type I interferon before infecting them with pneumococcal bacteria could help protect them from developing a serious infection.
We have developed a new computer model of how the brain works that can solve complex problems, like deciding which food to eat in a maze. This model has two layers of "neurons," which are like tiny computers that communicate with each other. The first layer of neurons is able to learn how to recognize patterns in the food, while the second layer is able to use this information to decide which food to go for. This model shows that the brain's way of learning and thinking is more complex than we thought, and that it's able to solve really difficult problems.
Breast cancer is a disease that is caused by the growth of abnormal cells. There are different types of breast cancer, and each type is caused by different factors. One of the factors that can cause breast cancer is a protein called ELF5. ELF5 is involved in the growth of cells that produce milk. In breast cancer, ELF5 can cause the growth of cancer cells and can also make the cancer cells more likely to spread to other parts of the body. In this study, researchers investigated how ELF5 is involved in the spread of breast cancer. They found that ELF5 can cause cancer cells to spread to other parts of the body. They also found that ELF5 can cause the body's immune system to help the cancer cells spread. The researchers hope that this information will help them find ways to treat breast cancer.
In recent years, evidence has shown that the interaction between chromatin loops, which can be characterized by three factors - connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication form - play an important role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. However, there is a need for a modeling effect that addresses the question of how changes in these factors affect variability at the expression level in a systematic rather than case-by-case fashion. In this study, we present such a modeling effort, based on a mechanic model that maps three fundamental patterns for two interacting DNA loops into a 4–state model of stochastic transcription. We first show that in contrast to side-by-side loops, nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise whereas alternating loops have just opposite effects. Then, we compare effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression. We find that the former performs better than the latter in controlling mean expression and in tuning expression noise, but this control or tuning is distance–dependent, remarkable for moderate loop lengths, and there is a limit loop length such that the difference in effect between two communication forms almost disappears. Our analysis and results justify the facilitated chromatin–looping hypothesis.
This research focuses on developing a new type of RNA called translation inhibiting RNA (tiRNA) that can repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. To create a predictive framework for tiRNA design, various features related to RNA structure and thermodynamics were analyzed in a design of experiments. First, an in silico analysis was performed to identify features with the highest information content. Next, the performance of these features was evaluated in vivo using a library of tiRNAs. A partial least squares model was constructed to link the features of tiRNA to gene repression, and this model was compared to an ordinary least squares model.
The relationship between neurons is thought to be important for memory and behavior. However, there is little known about how these relationships occur or how to identify them. In this study, the authors recorded the electrical signals from multiple sites in the brain of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of brain tissue. They discovered that when a group of neurons' activity patterns exceed a certain threshold, the patterns are replicated at other brain sites. This replication occurs quickly, within hundreds of milliseconds, and is similar to the way action potentials (single-cell signals) are replicated at the level of single cells. These patterns, which the authors called "coherence potentials", are unique to each group of neurons and can be used to identify specific associations. The nonlinear behavior of these coherence potentials is similar to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks.
In this study, we identified 25 essential genes in fission yeast that affect nuclear size control. We found that RNA processing and LINC complexes play important roles in nuclear size control. Our study also revealed lower and more extreme higher nuclear size phenotypes, and we identified global cellular processes and specific nuclear components that are important for nuclear size control. These findings are important for understanding how nuclear size is controlled in cells.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a commonly used treatment for neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET). It works by delivering a train of pulses with constant frequency via electrodes implanted into the brain. New "closed-loop" approaches aim to provide improvements in terms of efficiency, efficacy and reduction of side effects. The success of closed-loop DBS depends on being able to devise a stimulation strategy that minimizes oscillations in neural activity associated with symptoms of motor disorders. A useful stepping stone towards this is to construct a mathematical model, which can describe how the brain oscillations should change when stimulation is applied at a particular state of the system. Our work focuses on the use of coupled oscillators to represent neurons in areas generating pathological oscillations. Using a reduced form of the Kuramoto model, we analyze how a patient should respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude. Our predictions suggest that the best stimulation strategy should be phase specific but also that stimulation should have a greater effect if applied when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. We compare this surprising prediction with data obtained from ET patients. In light of our predictions, we also propose a new hybrid strategy which effectively combines two of the closed-loop strategies found in the literature.
This study was about developing a new method to detect the parasite Schistosoma mansoni in the fresh water pulmonate snails of the genus Biomphalaria that act as intermediate hosts for the parasite. The method, named Biompha-LAMP, used a set of six primers targeting a sequence of the parasite's ribosomal intergenic spacer 28S-18S rRNA, and was able to detect as little as 0.1 fg of S. mansoni DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes. The assay was evaluated by examining S. mansoni DNA in B. glabrata snails experimentally exposed to miracidia at different times post-exposure. DNA for LAMP assays was obtained by using a commercial DNA extraction kit or a simple heat NaOH extraction method. The Biompha-LAMP assay was able to detect S. mansoni DNA in all groups of snails and is specific, sensitive, rapid, and could be potentially adapted as a cost-effective method for screening of intermediate hosts infected with S. mansoni in both individual snails and pooled samples. This method could be suitable for large-scale field surveys for schistosomes control campaigns in endemic areas.
Dengue is a major public health problem in Sri Lanka, with all four serotypes of the dengue virus in circulation for more than 30 years. Dengue has become a high priority disease for public health authorities in Sri Lanka, with large numbers of public health staff involved in year-round dengue control activities and free medical care provided to dengue patients at public hospitals. The aim of this study was to estimate the public sector costs of dengue control activities and the direct costs of hospitalizations in Colombo district during the epidemic year of 2012. The costing was conducted from the Ministry of Health’s perspective and focused on operational and administration costs. The findings are expected to inform public health planning and decision-making in Sri Lanka and contribute to the growing body of literature on the costs of dengue prevention and treatment.
Scientists have been trying to figure out where most European Y chromosomes come from. They studied a specific genetic lineage, haplogroup R1b1b2, and found that it originates from the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic. This means that most European Y chromosomes likely came from the Neolithic expansion, which was a major cultural transition that happened around 10,000 years ago in the Near East.
This study aims to understand the relationship between motor variability and learning. It uses computer simulations and experiments to show that variability can have both positive and negative effects on learning, and that these effects can vary depending on the specific factors involved. The study also highlights the importance of sensory uncertainty in the relationship between variability and learning rate, and suggests that this relationship may depend on the specific task. Additionally, the study found that there is no clear statistical relationship between variability and learning rate across a wide range of previously published data.
This paper describes the structure of a protein complex between RelA, a component of the NF-κB family of transcription factors, and CBP/p300, a general transcriptional co-activator. The authors used NMR spectroscopy to solve the structure of the RelA:CBP/p300 complex. They found that RelA's transcriptional activation domain binds to a region of CBP/p300 called TAZ1, through hydrophobic interactions. The authors also designed mutants of RelA that selectively abrogated the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction, and used these mutants to gain insight into the role of this interaction in transcription. They found that genes that were previously thought to be independent of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction were actually dependent on it, and that the interaction is important for recruitment of RelA to its target promoter sites. This information can help us understand the role of the NF-κB pathway in immune response and inflammation.
Gene set analysis methods have been successfully used for analyzing gene expression data in cross-sectional studies. However, they need to be extended to longitudinal data because many experiments measure gene expression over time. The method presented here, called time-course gene set analysis (TcGSA), is an extension of gene set analysis to longitudinal data. TcGSA uses linear mixed effects models to analyze repeated measures in longitudinal data, and can accommodate missing data. It also allows for heterogeneity within gene sets. TcGSA has been applied to two real-life datasets: an HIV vaccine trial and a study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. It revealed significant changes in gene sets in both studies. The method is also supported by a simulation study and an R package.
The current understanding of where P. vivax, a common human malaria, is spread globally is not well-developed. This study aims to map the global endemicity of this disease using a statistical approach to combine existing data from various sources. Using this method, the authors find that P. vivax is most endemic in Asia, with the highest levels of endemicity in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Africa has lower levels of endemicity due to a high frequency of a genetic trait that protects against the disease. The Americas also have lower levels of endemicity, but these areas are densely populated, contributing to a higher number of people at risk globally. These maps and endemicity estimates can help guide efforts to control and eliminate P. vivax malaria in different regions of the world.
This study investigates the role of a protein called clumping factor B (ClfB) in skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. ClfB is a protein that helps S . aureus adhere and invade host cells and tissues, and evade the immune system. Previous studies have shown that ClfB helps S . aureus colonize the nose, but its role in SSTIs has not been investigated. The authors found that ClfB is important for the formation of abscesses and determines the bacterial burden during early infection. This was dependent on a specific interaction with the ligand loricrin, which is expressed within the abscess tissue. The authors also found that a vaccine that targets ClfB protects against S . aureus skin infection. Therefore, ClfB is an important antigen for future SSTI vaccines.
HIV-1 continues to be a major public health problem, and preventing its transmission is very important. The 90-90-90 goal set by UNAIDS aims to end AIDS by 2030 by reducing the number of new HIV infections. One way to achieve this goal is through pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which uses a medication to protect people who are at high risk of being exposed to HIV. There are currently two medications approved for PrEP: tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada). However, Truvada has limitations, including that it is expensive, requires daily dosing, and does not provide 100% protection from infection. To overcome these limitations, researchers are developing next-generation PrEP regimens, including more cost-effective drugs and drug formulations that require infrequent dosing. To help design these regimens, researchers need tools that integrate the various factors that affect PrEP efficacy, such as pharmacokinetics (how the body processes the medication), pharmacodynamics (how the medication affects the body), and viral characteristics. In this study, researchers developed a novel method that integrates these factors to predict the efficacy of different PrEP and PEP schedules. They used this method to analyze the second-generation integrase inhibitor dolutegravir, which has shown promise as a PrEP and PEP agent. The researchers found that oral 50mg dolutegravir provided non-inferior protection to Truvada and that nano-formulations of dolutegravir could potentially improve its prophylactic efficacy.
In this study, we discovered how Hepatitis C virus (HCV) regulates autophagy, a process in which cells break down damaged parts of their cells to recycle. We found that HCV causes two different proteins called Rubicon and UVRAG to be made. These proteins control the maturation of autophagosomes, which are the containers that carry the damaged parts of cells to be broken down. HCV makes more Rubicon than UVRAG at first, which leads to a temporary build-up of autophagosomes. But after a while, the balance of proteins changes, and more UVRAG is made, which helps to break down the autophagosomes. We also found that the HCV protein NS4B helps to make more Rubicon and autophagosomes. Overall, our study showed that HCV uses autophagy to its advantage by controlling when and how autophagosomes are broken down. This helps HCV to replicate itself more efficiently.
Researchers have discovered a protein called CCNYL1 that is very similar to another protein called CCNY in its genetic makeup. While the function of CCNYL1 is not well understood, the researchers found that it is highly expressed in the testis of mice and is important for male fertility. Mice without CCNYL1 were infertile, while those without CCNY had normal fertility. The researchers also found that CCNYL1 binds to a protein called CDK16 and that this binding leads to an increase in CDK16 kinase activity. This finding provides important new information about the role of CCNYL1 in spermatogenesis and male fertility.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) bacteria can cause serious illnesses such as diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition where the kidneys shut down. These diseases are caused by toxins produced by EHEC, including a toxin called EHEC-Hly. This toxin can be found in two forms: free or attached to tiny sacs called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Researchers found that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly can enter and damage human brain microvascular endothelial cells and intestinal epithelial cells, which are important sites of injury in HUS. The toxin is internalized by these cells via OMVs, but then separates from them and targets mitochondria, leading to cell death. These findings suggest a new mechanism for how EHEC-Hly can contribute to the development of HUS.
The article describes how the co-transcriptional modification of histones H2B and H3 is regulated by a conserved pathway in yeast and human cells. This pathway involves a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK9) that phosphorylates the subunit Spt5 of the elongation factor DSIF (DRB-sensitivity inducing factor) to promote the elongation of the mRNA. The article describes how the loss of the H2Bub1 modification, which is catalyzed by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Bre1, leads to the loss of Spt5 phosphorylation and results in the loss of the elongation factor DSIF from chromatin. This, in turn, leads to defects in mRNA elongation and, ultimately, cell death. The article suggests that CDK9 and H2Bub1 oppose each other to regulate mRNA elongation, but that proper balance between the two is ensured via a positive feedback loop. The article highlights the importance of the H2Bub1 modification in maintaining the balance between CDK9 and DSIF and in regulating mRNA elongation. It also suggests that defects in H2Bub1 may contribute to the development of diseases such as cancer.
We examined YFV isolates from around the world and created a new timeline of the virus's evolution. The virus has been transmitted among humans via Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for centuries. We found that YFV originated in Africa and was introduced to the Americas by slave ships. This discovery has important implications for controlling future outbreaks of the disease.
In this study, the authors examined the pathogenesis of the pneumococcus, a bacterial pathogen that causes a range of diseases including otitis media, pneumonia, and sepsis, in an infant mouse model. They identified key points in the pathogenesis process where the pneumococcus must pass through a population bottleneck, which is a sharp reduction in the size of the population due to environmental constraints. This study provides insights into potential weak points in the pathogenesis process of the pneumococcus that could be targeted for intervention strategies. By using an animal model, the authors were able to recapitulate many of the key features of pneumococcal pathogenesis, including increased susceptibility in infants, localized disease, invasive infection, and transmission.
A new study has been conducted to test whether humans have been exposed to bites from the sand fly Phlebotomus orientalis, a vector for visceral leishmaniasis. The study uses recombinant proteins derived from P. orientalis' salivary glands to test human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia. The study found that two recombinant proteins, mAG5 and mYEL1, are the best markers for exposure to P. orientalis bites. These proteins were also found to increase the sensitivity of the test when used in combination. This study is the first to use recombinant proteins to screen for exposure to P. orientalis bites in humans. It could help in the development of new ways to prevent visceral leishmaniasis.
Conjugative plasmids are small, self-replicating pieces of DNA that can be transferred from one bacterial cell to another, and are found in many different types of bacteria. They often carry genes that confer advantages such as antibiotic resistance to the bacteria that host them. One type of conjugative plasmid, called IncC, has been found in many different types of bacteria, including those that cause foodborne illness. These plasmids can replicate themselves and transfer to other bacteria. In this study, researchers looked at a specific type of IncC plasmid called IncC-A/C, which carries a gene cargo that includes resistance to multiple antibiotics and other useful genes. They wanted to know how IncC-A/C plasmids transfer themselves to other bacteria. They found that the transfer of IncC-A/C plasmids is controlled by a protein called AcaCD, which is encoded on the plasmid. They also found that a cluster of genes called traNS, traHGS, and traGS are important for IncC-A/C plasmid transfer. These genes encode proteins that may be involved in the formation of a pore through which the plasmid is transferred from one cell to another. The researchers then investigated the role of each protein in this process. They found that the TraG protein of the plasmid is important for the pore to form, and that this protein may allow the plasmid to overcome an entry exclusion mechanism encoded by the IncC plasmid. Overall, the study provides important insights into how IncC-A/C plasmids are transferred between bacteria, which could have important implications for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes.
This study investigates how a protein called Cdc5 helps cells adapt to DNA damage. When DNA is damaged, cells pause in their life cycle to repair the damage. However, if the damage is too extensive, the cells cannot repair it and have to keep going with their life cycle despite the damage. This is called adapting. Cdc5 is involved in this process of adapting. The study showed that Cdc5 helps cells adapt by reducing the level of hyperphosphorylation of another protein called Rad53. Hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 is important for maintaining the paused state of cells during DNA damage. By reducing the level of hyperphosphorylation of Rad53, Cdc5 helps cells adapt to the DNA damage and continue with their life cycle.
In this paper, the authors present a new computational model, called the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, that can be used to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. The KNP framework is tailored to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales and is able to account for the electric interactions between different ion species and their effects on the ECS potential. The authors compare the KNP framework to the more physically detailed Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) scheme and find that the KNP framework can provide good results when the system is in a quasi-steady state. The authors also introduce simplified schemes, called the volume conductor (VC) and diffusion only (DO) schemes, which can be derived from the KNP scheme by making specific assumptions. The authors compare the simplified schemes to the KNP scheme and find that the VC scheme gives good results when the diffusive effects on the membrane potential are negligible, while the DO scheme gives good results when the migratory effects on the concentration dynamics are negligible. The authors then apply the KNP framework to a 3-D domain with a pyramidal neuron embedded in it and find that concentration gradients gradually build up in the ECS due to the neural activity and influence the local potential in the ECS. The authors compare the results obtained with the KNP framework to those obtained with the VC, DO, and PNP schemes and find that the KNP framework gives the most accurate results. Overall, the authors' new KNP framework provides a useful tool for studying electrodiffusive phenomena in the ECS on large spatiotemporal scales.
The US government is considering cutting the budget of a program that monitors and researches diseases spread by mosquitoes. This program is responsible for tracking diseases like dengue and West Nile virus, which are already in the US. If the budget is cut, it could be difficult for the program to detect new mosquito-borne diseases before they become widespread, which could lead to higher costs for managing those diseases. We used a computer model to study the effects of a delayed response to an outbreak of dengue virus, which could happen if the budget is cut. We found that delaying the response could cost up to 10 times more than an early response. We also found that it is better to spend money on prevention, such as monitoring and early detection, than on response after an outbreak occurs. This study shows the importance of the program's budget and the need for continued surveillance of mosquito-borne diseases.
Dengue is a growing problem worldwide, and Nicaragua has seen its share of dengue outbreaks. The study was conducted to examine the role of dengue as a cause of acute febrile illness (AFI) in a hospital in León, Nicaragua. A convenience sample of patients 1 year of age and older who presented with AFI were enrolled, and paired sera were taken from them, 2-4 weeks after the onset of their illness. Dengue IgG and IgM were tested, as well as dengue virus using reverse transcriptase-PCR. Out of the 740 febrile patients enrolled, 90% had paired sera. Of those, 470 were seropositive for dengue at enrollment. The seroprevalence increased with age and was over 90% in people over 20 years old. Acute dengue was confirmed in 38 cases, which was 5.1% of the total enrolled. Only 8.1% of these confirmed cases were suspected clinically. The study highlights the importance of considering dengue as a cause of AFI, even in rural areas. The population studied is at risk for the Zika virus, which has now reached Central America, as it is transmitted by the same vector as dengue.
Plants are under constant threat from nematodes, root-knot and cyst nematodes are particularly damaging. These nematodes invade roots and cause feeding sites that lead to reduced crop yields. Plant defense against pathogens relies on recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns by surface-localized receptors that lead to activation of plant-triggered immunity. Extensive studies have been done to understand the role of PTI in various plant-pathogen interactions, but far less is known about the role of PTI in plants-nematode interactions. In this study, we show that nematode-derived proteinaceous elicitor/s can induce PTI in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the common immune co-receptor BAK1. We also identified a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, termed NILR1 that is specifically regulated upon infection by nematodes. NILR1 is essential for PTI responses initiated by nematodes and nilr1 loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to a broad category of nematodes. This is the first example of an immune receptor that is involved in induction of basal immunity ( PTI ) in plants or in animals in response to nematodes. This knowledge can be used to develop new options for nematode control in crop plants in future.
The study used miltefosine to treat adult Schistosoma mansoni worms. After the treatment, the researchers examined the surface of the worms using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. They found that rabbit antibodies that recognized surface antigens exposed on miltefosine-treated worms were recovered by elution off the worm surface in low pH buffer. These antibodies were then used in a western immunoblotting assay to identify antigenic targets in a homogenate extract of adult worms. The researchers found four proteins that reacted with the antibodies in immunoblots. These proteins were identified as fructose-1 , 6 bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22 . 6 , alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. The researchers also found that the antibodies bound to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula and induced immune agglutination of the parasites. This study reveals a novel mode of action of miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent. The researchers suggest that these antibodies may have a role in immune protection. This study provides new information about the mechanism of action of miltefosine and may lead to the development of new drugs to treat schistosomiasis.
In host-pathogen interactions, bacteria fight for iron to survive. To acquire iron, bacteria have developed different systems to extract iron from various sources. These systems are controlled by the global regulator Fur. One such system is the Isd system in Staphylococcus aureus, which uses cell wall-anchored proteins with a NEAT (NEAr iron Transporter) domain to interact with heme and hemoglobin. A growing number of studies have shown that NEAT domains are important for heme binding in several Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus. In addition to heme, ferritin can also be a source of iron for bacteria. The molecular basis of ferritin utilization by bacteria is poorly documented. Only two molecular determinants have been identified: Als3 in Candida albicans and IlsA in Bacillus cereus. In vitro studies have shown that IlsA binds ferritin, but the details of this interaction have not been described. Here, we report that IlsA acts as a ferritin receptor on the surface of Bacillus cereus, and that it binds directly to the ferritin subunits. We also show that bacillibactin, a siderophore produced by Bacillus cereus, is essential for iron acquisition from ferritin and for full virulence of Bacillus cereus in an insect model, suggesting that IlsA and bacillibactin may work synergistically to effectively mobilize iron from host ferritin.
The primary pacemaker of a circadian clock in a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria is a protein called KaiC. KaiC has three parts, or domains, and can hydrolyze ATP. KaiC forms a hexamer, which is like a little oscillator. The oscillators need to run in phase with each other to make a bigger oscillation. To do this, they use a mechanism called differential affinity. This means that some of the oscillators will be in the middle of a cycle, while others are at the beginning. The ones in the middle have completed their cycle and are ready to be phosphorylated again, but they don’t have KaiA to do this. The laggards, or oscillators that are in the middle of a cycle, bind KaiB to themselves to keep themselves in the inactive state, which takes away KaiA from the front runners, or oscillators that are at the beginning of the cycle. This slows down the front runners, allowing the laggards to catch up. This is called phosphorylation, and it allows the oscillators to run in phase with each other. The main driver of the clock is ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain of KaiC. This causes a conformational switch to the inactive state, which is necessary for the synchronization of the oscillators. In summary, the clock is driven by ATP hydrolysis, which switches KaiC to an inactive state, and phosphorylation, which happens in the CII domain of KaiC, and keeps the oscillators running in phase with each other.
This study shows that the hepatitis B virus (HBV) can suppress the immune response to infection by using the protein Parkin to interfere with a key part of the immune signaling process. HBV is a virus that can cause chronic infections and is a major public health problem. It has been shown that HBV can activate the immune response, but this study shows that the virus may also be able to suppress the immune response by using Parkin to disrupt the signaling process. This study provides new information about how HBV might evade the immune system, which could be useful for developing new treatments for chronic hepatitis B.
This study reports the crystal structure of pfiT, a T-cell superantigen associated with Crohn's disease, at 1.7Å resolution and provides a functional analysis of the interaction of pfiT and its homolog, PA2885, with human class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Both pfiT and PA2885 bound to mammalian cells and stimulated the proliferation of human lymphocytes. This binding was greatly inhibited by anti-class II MHC antibodies, and to a lesser extent, by anti-HLA-DQ and DP antibodies, indicating that the binding was class II MHC-specific. GST-pfiT efficiently precipitated both endogenous and in vitro purified recombinant HLA-DR1 molecules, indicating that pfiT directly interacted with HLA-DR1. Competition studies revealed that pfiT and Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen (MAM) competed for binding to HLA-DR, indicating that their binding sites overlap. Structural analyses established that pfiT belongs to the TetR-family of DNA-binding transcription regulators. The distinct structure of pfiT indicates that it represents a new family of T-cell superantigens.
Scientists have found that stem cells have different levels of the protein NANOG. This protein plays a key role in the process of self-renewal, which is the ability of stem cells to make more stem cells over time. Researchers have developed a mathematical model to explain the different levels of NANOG in stem cells. They found that the distribution of NANOG in stem cells can be divided into three different groups: stem cells with no NANOG, stem cells with only one allele of NANOG, and stem cells with both alleles of NANOG. They also found that stem cells with one allele of NANOG transition to stem cells with both alleles of NANOG over time. These findings suggest that stem cells may have a range of different levels of NANOG, and that this range is dynamic over time.
A recent study aimed to understand how much of the proteome is unused in different environments and how this may impact cellular growth. To do this, the researchers used a combination of genome-scale absolute proteomics measurements and a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli proteome allocation. They found that almost half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments and this contributes to most of the variation in growth rates of E. coli across 16 different environments. The researchers also discovered that reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. Furthermore, they found that the unused protein encodes several nutrient- and stress- preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering the costs and benefits of protein synthesis on organismal fitness, particularly in microbes where growth is an important component of fitness.
The paper describes a study that aimed to identify genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in three Asian populations: Chinese, Malays, and Asian Indians. The authors used genome-wide association scans to identify these variants and compared their results with those of previous studies in European populations. They found that some variants previously associated with T2D in European populations were also associated with T2D in the three Asian populations, but that the strength of the association varied across populations. The authors also observed some differences in the genetic architecture of T2D across the three populations. The findings of the study highlight the importance of considering population differences in genetic studies of complex diseases.
The paper focuses on the process of mitosis in the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, which is a budding yeast that causes meningitis and pneumonia in humans. The paper describes the unconventional process of mitosis in this yeast and how the kinetochores are clustered gradually in contrast to other yeast species. The authors also propose a model of nuclear migration in C. neoformans, which is different from the ones in other yeast species. They found that the Aurora B kinase, Ipl1, is required for the timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope and spatio-temporal regulation of nuclear division during semi-open mitosis in C. neoformans. The authors also found that Ipl1 regulates the dynamics of kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. The authors suggest that Ipl1 spatio-temporally influences Bim1 or/and dynein activity along with microtubule stability to ensure timely onset of nuclear division.
In this study, we analyzed the role of a synonymous mutation in RET, a gene that encodes a protein important for the development of medullary thyroid cancer. RET is a gene that plays a critical role in the development of medullary thyroid cancer. However, the role of synonymous mutations in RET is not well understood. In this study, we used a combination of molecular techniques to examine the role of a synonymous mutation in RET in a patient with medullary thyroid cancer. Our findings suggest that this synonymous mutation may contribute to the progression of cancer by altering the way that RET is processed in the cell. Overall, our study highlights the importance of understanding the role of synonymous mutations in the development of cancer.
Metagenomic sequencing is a technique used to find pathogens in patient samples. However, this technique requires a database of pathogen genomes for comparison, which may not be complete and may contain contamination. This study presents a method for eliminating contamination from genomes, which was applied to create a database of "clean" pathogen genomes. Using this database, researchers found more pathogens in patient samples while reducing false positives. This new method should improve the use of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosing human infections.
Scientists have studied the genetic diversity of Trypanosoma brucei parasites from different parts of Uganda and Kenya. They analyzed the parasites at 17 microsatellite loci and looked for the presence of the SRA gene, which is responsible for human infectivity. The scientists found three distinct genetic clusters in Uganda and Kenya. The first cluster was found in central and southern Uganda, the second cluster in southwestern Kenya, and the third cluster in central Uganda. The scientists also found evidence of genetic admixture among the clusters and long-range dispersal. They concluded that HAT is still a major health problem in Uganda and that it has spread from the old foci to the new foci. They also highlighted that T. brucei is not a reproductively isolated taxon and that genetic exchange is possible.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is a protein that helps regulate the body's response to oxidative stress. It is also believed to be involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, researchers found that mice lacking TXNIP were more susceptible to endotoxic shock caused by a substance called lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The researchers also found that this increased susceptibility was due to higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) being produced and that the production of NO was linked to the NLRP3 inflammasome. These findings suggest that TXNIP plays a critical role in regulating the body's response to endotoxic shock through the production of NO and the NLRP3 inflammasome.
We studied a protein called ZTF-8, which helps repair damage to DNA in the germ cells of worms. ZTF-8 helps with a process called DNA damage response (DDR), which helps repair DNA damage. We discovered that ZTF-8 helps with a specific type of DNA damage repair called double-strand break repair (DSBR). We found that ZTF-8 helps with a specific type of DDR called the DNA damage checkpoint, which helps repair DNA damage by stopping cells from dividing. We found that ZTF-8 helps with a specific type of DNA damage repair called meiotic DNA damage checkpoint response, which helps repair DNA damage during a special type of cell division called meiosis. We also found that ZTF-8 is similar to a protein called RHINO, which helps with DSBR in humans. We propose that ZTF-8 helps repair DNA damage by transducing DNA damage checkpoint signaling via the 9-1-1 pathway. Our study showed that ZTF-8 is important for repairing DNA damage in the germ cells of worms and that its functions are conserved between worms and humans.
The paper is about how certain genes help to make motor neurons in the spinal cord. Researchers have been studying how different cells develop and how they know what type of cell to become. They have found that certain genes are important in deciding what type of cell a cell will become. These genes are called transcription factors. One of these transcription factors, called Olig2, helps to make motor neurons. Researchers have been studying how Olig2 works to make motor neurons. They have used single cell transcriptomics, which means looking at the genes that are turned on and off in individual cells, to try to figure out how Olig2 works to make motor neurons. The researchers have found that Olig2 is important for making motor neurons in two different ways. First, Olig2 turns on a gene called Ngn2, which helps to make motor neurons. Second, Olig2 turns off a gene called Hes5, which makes cells divide and remain as progenitors. These findings help scientists understand how cells become different types of cells and how genes work together to help make those cells.
Influenza viruses can cause a range of symptoms from mild to severe, depending on the type of virus and the age and health of the host. When a new strain of influenza virus emerges, it can be difficult to predict whether it will cause severe disease in humans. This is especially true for pandemic influenza viruses, which are typically antigenically novel and have not been circulating in humans before. In this study, researchers examined how T cells, a type of immune cell, might play a role in protecting humans from a novel pandemic influenza virus.  Previously, researchers had shown that T cells from mice can protect against influenza viruses from different subtypes, even when the animals had been previously infected with a virus from a different subtype. This is called "heterosubtypic immunity." The researchers wanted to see if this type of immunity also occurred in humans.  To do this, the researchers infected rhesus macaques (a type of primate) with a seasonal human influenza virus. They then challenged the animals with a new pandemic influenza virus (2009 H1N1) and measured the animals' immune responses. They found that the animals that had been previously infected with the seasonal virus had stronger T cell responses to the new pandemic virus, and these T cells may have helped to clear the virus from the animals' bodies faster. The researchers also found that these T cells could recognize epitopes (small parts of the virus) that were conserved across different influenza virus subtypes. This suggests that vaccines that induce T cell responses to conserved epitopes might help to protect people against future pandemic influenza viruses.
Q fever is a disease caused by bacteria called Coxiella burnetii, and it's the most widespread zoonosis in the world. The bacteria can infect humans, and the disease often lacks specific clinical features. Conventional serodiagnosis is difficult to use for early diagnosis. A new method called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been developed, and it can rapidly and sensitively detect the bacteria. The LAMP assay has been compared to the real-time PCR assay, and the LAMP assay was found to be more specific and faster than the real-time PCR assay. Overall, the LAMP assay is a potentially useful tool for diagnosing Q fever in humans and domestic animals.
Cancer cells can have gene expression patterns similar to embryonic stem cells. These genes are controlled by special regulatory regions called enhancers, which are involved in cell signaling pathways. The enhancers in cancer cells are different from those in normal cells, and some of them are specific to embryonic stem cells. These enhancers are prone to DNA methylation changes, which can turn them into silent regions. The DNA methylation level of these enhancers is linked to the expression levels of adjacent genes. This means that the methylation of enhancers may be involved in the reactivation of embryonic stem genes in cancer cells.
Natural selection helps populations to adapt and survive by selecting those with the best traits. However, sometimes populations can get stuck in a "fitness valley" or "plateau" where mutations that could help them move forward are not selected. Subdividing a population can help them overcome these obstacles by allowing different parts of the population to explore different paths simultaneously. In this paper, the authors study how subdividing a population can help them cross a fitness valley or plateau. They find that subdivision can speed up the process significantly, especially if the fastest deme drives the process. They also find that subdivision is most effective if the population is in a certain stage of evolution. Their results provide insight into how natural selection works and how populations evolve.
In this study, we analyzed the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with dengue virus, the primary vector for several viruses that cause major human diseases such as Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever. We used high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify the metabolic changes that occur in response to virus infection over time, and compared the metabolic profiles of infected and uninfected midguts. We observed significant fluctuations in molecules involved in membrane building blocks, bioactive messengers, energy storage, and lipid biosynthesis. Our results provide valuable insights into the complex relationship between mosquito metabolism and dengue virus infection.
The research is about developing a simple and new model of a rabbit's action potential (AP) using a combination of a novel formulation of sodium and potassium currents. This new model is referred to as the parsimonious rabbit (PR) model. The researchers used data from rabbit heart cells and tissues to develop this model. They calibrated and evaluated the model using several experimental data sets from rabbit heart cells and tissues. The PR model was able to reproduce several important phenomena, including cellular alternans, reentrant spiral waves, and spiral wave breakup. The simplicity and parsimony of the PR model, along with its ability to reproduce complex phenomena, make it an important tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias.
The researchers in this study looked at the process of sexual reproduction in the ciliate Paramecium. During this process, a specific type of DNA is cut out from the genome and eliminated. The researchers wanted to understand how this process happens. They found that a specific type of enzyme called Ligase IV and another enzyme called Xrcc4p are involved in this process. These enzymes help to repair the cuts that are made in the DNA. The researchers found that these enzymes are important for the final assembly of the somatic genome, which is the type of DNA that is found in the adult form of the ciliate.
Chagas heart disease is a serious health problem that affects millions of people, particularly in Latin America. Sudden death has been considered the main cause of death in people with Chagas heart disease, but this information mainly comes from a period before the introduction of drugs that changed the natural history of heart failure. We wanted to study the current mode of death in people with Chagas heart disease and compare it to non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. We analyzed the results of a study that included patients with heart failure due to Chagas heart disease or non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. We found that the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in people with Chagas heart disease compared to those with non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. However, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups. In addition, we found that Chagas etiology, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, creatinine clearance, and use of amiodarone were independently associated with heart failure mortality. Left ventricular end diastolic diameter and use of beta-blocker were independently associated with sudden death mortality. These findings challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications in the selection of treatment choices, considering the mode of death.
The NIK1–NSP interaction is an important part of the defense pathway against geminiviruses. It has been identified as a target of the geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein (NSP). Researchers have discovered that rpL10A (a specific partner and substrate of NIK1) is a critical component of the NIK1-mediated signaling pathway. It redirects phosphorylated rpL10A to the nucleus, where it may act to modulate viral infection. The NIK1-mediated defense signaling neither activates RNA silencing nor promotes a hypersensitive response but inhibits plant growth and development. The study provides both genetic and biochemical evidence for the role of rpL10A in the NIK1-mediated defense signaling pathway.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a type of fungus that causes disease in humans. This fungus is able to survive and grow in the presence of ROS (reactive oxygen species) that are produced by immune cells. The AOX (alternative oxidase) enzyme is important for this fungus to survive and grow in the presence of ROS, and is likely important for its ability to cause disease in humans. To study the role of AOX in P. brasiliensis, scientists created a P. brasiliensis AOX-antisense (PbAOX-aRNA) strain with a reduced amount of the AOX gene. This strain was then used to study how it interacts with immune cells and in a mouse model of infection. The results showed that the PbAOX-aRNA strain had decreased survival in the presence of immune cells and in the mouse model of infection. These findings suggest that the AOX enzyme is important for the survival of P. brasiliensis in the presence of ROS produced by immune cells, and may be important for its ability to cause disease in humans.
The hippocampus stores memories as a combination of spatial and contextual information. In the hippocampus, the brain forms a representation of the environment through a dual-coding scheme: each neuron is active when an animal is located in a specific location in space, and its firing rate within this location varies with the contextual features of the surrounding environment. These two coding schemes can be distinguished by observing how the network remaps in response to changes in the environment. When the environment is physically different, the firing locations and firing rates of place cells change entirely (global remapping). When the environment is manipulated while remaining in the same physical space, place cells change their firing rates without changing firing locations (rate remapping). A recent experiment morphed a familiar square arena into a familiar circular arena while observing the responses of CA3 place cells. The experiment found that the population activity of CA3 place cells transitioned gradually from the square arena to the circular arena. However, on the single neuron level, some place cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions, and some displayed hysteresis, a signature of attractor dynamics. To understand whether these conflicting results were in line with attractor network theory, a neural network model of CA3 was developed. The model found that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, the contextual features of the surrounding environment were encoded as position-dependent context attractors that made the transitions at different points along the morph sequence. The smooth transition curves arose from averaging across the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single unit level. These findings suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells.
Entamoeba histolytica is a parasite that causes amebic dysentery, an infection characterized by bloody diarrhea. While this parasite lacks some of the usual antioxidant defense mechanisms, it has alternative strategies for dealing with oxidative stress caused by infection. In this study, researchers used capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to measure the levels of charged metabolites in E. histolytica in response to oxidative stress. They found that oxidative stress caused drastic changes in the levels of metabolites involved in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. The researchers also identified a functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica, which may be used as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system. They proposed that the glycerol biosynthetic pathway may be an important player in the response to oxidative stress in this parasite.
In this study, researchers investigated the function of IKAROS, a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate, in transcriptional regulation. It was found that IKAROS can activate transcription and promote chromatin organization through its association with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase (NuRD) complex and the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb). The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions, which leads to the activation of transcription elongation. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between IKAROS and NuRD in transcriptional regulation.
Rabies is a deadly zoonotic disease caused by a virus that is maintained in bats in the Americas. Trinidad has experienced periodic outbreaks of rabies within the livestock population, but there have been no human cases since 1937. In this study, researchers sequenced the RABV from 37 animals in Trinidad and used phylogenetic analysis to investigate the origin and movement of RABV in Trinidad. They found three separate lineages of RABV that originated from different parts of South America and arrived in Trinidad at different times. These findings suggest that rabies in Trinidad is not static, but rather constantly evolving and being influenced by movement from the mainland. The researchers recommend that further studies should be done to investigate the relationship between RABV dynamics and bat population ecology, especially any movement between the mainland and Trinidad.
The article describes a model that uses mathematical and computational methods to understand the gene network that is responsible for the development of the areas of the cerebral cortex in the brain. The authors found that only a limited set of interactions among five genes involved in this process are necessary to produce the expression patterns observed in experiments. They also identified structural elements that are common to the best-performing networks and elements that are never present in these networks, which could help guide future experimental investigations into this process.
This study looked at a type of protein called Bmi1, which is a part of a group of proteins called Polycomb group proteins. These proteins are important for controlling the development of animals by regulating the expression of developmental genes. The study looked at the role that Bmi1 plays in the regulation of developmental genes through a process called transcriptional regulation. This process involves the modification of a type of protein called histone, which is part of the structure of DNA. The study used a new technology called ChIP-Seq to map the distribution of Bmi1-dependent uH2A on the DNA of cells called MEFs. The results of the study showed that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is enriched near the start site of genes that are lowly expressed in normal cells, and that uH2A is also found near genes with the H3K27me3 mark. The study also found that the distribution of uH2A is not limited to regions containing the H3K27me3 mark.
The study describes how the noncoding RNA Pregnancy-induced noncoding RNA (PINC) regulates mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation. PINC is highly expressed in alveolar cells during pregnancy and in regressed alveolar cells following involution. The study shows that PINC is enriched in luminal and alveolar progenitors and its expression increases throughout pregnancy but decreases during lactation. The study also suggests that PINC inhibits terminal differentiation of alveolar cells during pregnancy to prevent abundant milk production and secretion until parturition. Moreover, the study demonstrates that PINC interacts with retinoblastoma-associated protein 46 (RbAp46) as well as other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and identifies potential targets of mPINC that are differentially expressed following modulation of mPINC expression levels. Overall, the study provides evidence for a role of PINC in regulating mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy and lactation.
The study investigates the role of PML ( Promyelocytic Leukemia protein ) in HIV-1 infection. PML is a member of the TRIM ( tripartite motif ) protein family that plays a role in antiviral defense. PML is mainly found in the nucleus of cells, but infection by HIV-1 and other retroviruses triggers its re-localization to the cytoplasm of cells. This re-localization occurs as early as 30 minutes post-infection and is specific to retroviral reverse-transcription. The study shows that PML interferes with an early step of retroviral infection and stabilizes the protein Daxx, which is an antiviral restriction factor targeting reverse-transcription.
Matt is an aligned fragment pair chaining algorithm that aligns multiple protein structures. Unlike other methods that have limited flexibility in alignments, Matt allows for local flexibility by temporarily allowing small translations and rotations in the intermediate steps of the alignment process. After a dynamic programming assembly guided by these "bent" alignments, geometric consistency is restored before the final alignment is output. Matt's global performance is competitive with other recent multiple protein structure alignment programs on the popular Homstrad and SABmark benchmark datasets. Matt outperforms other programs on SABmark, a benchmark of multiple structure alignments of proteins with more distant homology, in terms of aligning the ends of α-helices and β-strands. Matt's strong performance comes from its ability to model proteins in different conformational states and its ability to model backbone distortions in more distantly related proteins.
The study was conducted to understand the dynamic regulation of Greatwall kinase (Gwl), which is involved in controlling the timing of mitosis in cells. The authors used a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments using phospho-specific antibodies to monitor the dephosphorylation of Gwl and its substrates during mitotic entry and exit. The study found that Greatwall is dephosphorylated at the essential Cdk site Thr194 by PP2A/B55. The dephosphorylation of Ensa/ARPP19 is mediated by the RNA Polymerase II carboxy terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1. Surprisingly, the inhibition or depletion of neither Fcp1 nor PP2A appears to block dephosphorylation of the bulk of mitotic Cdk1 substrates during mitotic exit. The authors suggest a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP19 and Cdk substrate dephosphorylation during mitotic exit.
This study looks at the way the body creates antibodies to fight HIV, a virus that causes AIDS. The study focuses on the type of antibodies that are created during the early stages of infection, specifically those that target the outer surface of the virus. These antibodies, called neutralizing antibodies (Nab), can prevent the virus from infecting new cells. The study looked at two patients who were recently infected with a type of HIV called subtype C, which accounts for a majority of HIV infections worldwide. The study found that the patients developed high levels of Nab against the virus that initially infected them. However, changes in the virus occurred that allowed it to escape from the Nab. The study used a variety of methods to map out the escape pathways and found that different regions of the virus were involved in escape in each patient. The study also found that the patients' antibodies targeted different regions of the virus, and that these regions were not always the same as the regions that were involved in escape. Overall, the study provides a detailed look at the way the body creates antibodies to fight HIV and how the virus is able to escape from those antibodies.
The article you provided is a scientific paper about the extent and nature of selection in the genomes of plants. The authors aimed to sequence the genomes of 13 different plants from the same species and analyze the amount of positive and negative selection that occurs across the genome. They compared selection in coding regions (which contain the genes) to non-coding regions (which do not contain genes). They found that selection is much stronger in coding regions, but weak in most non-coding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). However, the authors also found that there are strong signals of selection in some non-coding regions that are conserved across the Brassicaceae family. Moreover, they found reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and non-coding regions, indicating that recent selective sweeps have occurred at these sites. Finally, the authors used gene expression data to show that genes that are more highly expressed experience stronger negative selection, but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. Overall, the authors suggest that positive and negative selection occur in both coding and regulatory regions, but that the frequency of selection in non-coding regions is much lower in plants than in animals.
EBV is a virus that causes many types of lymphoid and epithelial cell malignancies, including Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and lymphoproliferative disorders in the immunosuppressed. EBV infects and transforms B-lymphocytes, which are immune cells that produce antibodies. EBNA2 is a protein that EBV produces and that is important for the transformation of B-lymphocytes. EBNA2 binds to RBP-jκ and EBF1, which are proteins that help with the development of B-lymphocytes. EBNA2 helps RBP-jκ and EBF1 bind to new locations in the DNA, which leads to changes in the way the B-lymphocytes develop. This can help the B-lymphocytes grow and survive.
This study aimed to understand more about the genetic structure and vector competence of mosquitoes in Mexico that carry dengue virus. The authors found that a natural barrier in Veracruz, Mexico, prevented the movement of mosquitoes from north to south. This barrier was identified using a mitochondrial gene that is commonly used to track genetic diversity in mosquito populations. In addition, the authors measured the ability of mosquitoes to transmit dengue virus and found that mosquitoes from the north had a higher ability to transmit dengue virus than those from the south. The authors suggest that further research is needed to better understand the barrier that prevents the movement of mosquitoes and to determine whether differences in vector competence are stable and have an impact on dengue transmission.
The bacterial protein DnaA is responsible for replication in bacteria. It binds to the origin of replication and drives the initiation process. It is thought that initiation occurs when enough ATP-bound DnaA has accumulated. In this study, the authors overexpressed DnaA and analyzed the timing of initiation. They found that a two-fold increase in DnaA concentration did not affect the timing of initiation in any growth conditions tested. This suggests that although DnaA is the key feature of the cell cycle motor, it is not the limiting factor for precise timing of initiation of replication.
Oscillatory activity plays an important role in regulating biological processes at different levels. To understand these interactions, a new method called partial Granger causality is introduced. It is able to reveal interaction patterns in multivariate data with exogenous inputs and latent variables in the frequency domain. This method is extensively tested with toy models and successfully applied to experimental datasets, including gene microarray data, in vivo local field potentials recorded from the inferotemporal cortex of a sheep, and in vivo local field potentials recorded from distributed sites in the right hemisphere of a macaque monkey. The method reveals different frequencies in these datasets and the causal relationships between them.
Recent advances in high-throughput genotyping have enabled large-scale studies of genetic variation, including genome-wide association studies and the inference of population history from genetic data. These studies have expanded to include individuals of diverse ancestry, such as those from the United States, Latin America, and Africa. To accurately map genetic associations in these populations, it is important to determine the ancestry at each locus in the genome. This is traditionally done using a technique called local ancestry inference, which estimates the ancestral origins of genetic variants. However, most of the methods used to infer local ancestry are designed for use with genotyping arrays, and do not take advantage of the full spectrum of data available from sequencing. In addition, many of these methods are computationally demanding and cannot be used for large-scale sequenced populations. In this article, the authors present new methods for local ancestry inference that leverage continent-specific variants to attain increased performance over existing approaches in sequenced admixed genomes. The authors use simulations to show that their approach attains accuracy similar to widely used computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches with large decreases in runtime. Most importantly, the authors show that their method recovers comparable local ancestries to the 1000 Genomes consensus local ancestry calls in the real admixed individuals from the 1000 Genomes Project. The authors extend their approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and show that accurate local ancestry inference can be attained at low sequencing coverage. Finally, the authors generalize continent-specific variants to sub-continental population-specific variants and show that in some cases it is possible to determine the sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments on the basis of these variants. Overall, the authors present a fast and accurate method for local ancestry inference that can be used for large-scale sequenced populations, making it an important tool for genetic studies in diverse populations.
Circadian rhythm, or approximately daily rhythm, is a common oscillating pattern found in many organisms, including humans. It is driven by a molecular clock located in the suprachiasmic nucleus of the brain, but active molecular clocks have also been reported in peripheral tissues. While some studies have demonstrated the importance of analyzing circadian rhythms for understanding both physiology and pathology, other studies have shown that the prominence and impact of oscillatory processes in living tissues may still be underestimated. Analyzing time series gene expression data for periodic patterns is challenging due to the limited number of time points in such studies, high degree of stochastic variation in microarray expression intensity, and the fact that microarray expression estimation is not always reliable. A new approach to identifying circadian oscillation in gene expression is proposed in the article. This approach involves applying digital signal processing algorithms separately to each group of genes oscillating in the same phase, combined with statistical tests for periodicity. This method identifies circadian baseline oscillation in almost 100% of all expressed genes, suggesting that it should be evaluated in any study related to biological pathways. Changes in gene expression caused by mutations or regulation of environmental factors, such as photic stimuli or feeding, should be considered in the context of changes in the amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations.
Meiotic recombination is the process of genetic mixing that occurs during the formation of haploid cells from diploid cells during meiosis. Recombination occurs at specific locations in the genome and leads to different patterns of genetic inheritance in offspring. Researchers have studied recombination in humans, plants, and yeast to understand how it works and how it varies across species. However, there has been limited information about recombination in birds. To address this, researchers used whole-genome re-sequencing of a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers to identify 325 CO events at a median resolution of 1.4 kb. They also found 267 non-crossover (NCO) events. The study found that recombination is concentrated in specific regions of the genome, which are associated with genes, especially promoters and CpG islands. The study also found that CO rates are higher in male meiosis and towards the ends of chromosomes. The study used phased sequencing data from three-generation pedigrees to analyze the characteristics and consequences of recombination in an avian system. The researchers used the data to analyze the localization, distribution, and consequences of recombination in birds.
The thermodynamics of protein folding is a complex topic that is still not completely understood. However, recent advances in our understanding of how repeat-protein domains fold have shed light on the fundamental principles of protein folding. Repeat-proteins are composed of multiple repeating units that are stacked together to form long helical structures. The energy landscape of these proteins can be described as a series of energy minima separated by energy barriers. By studying the thermodynamics of repeat-protein folding, researchers have gained insight into the fundamental principles of protein folding, including the importance of cooperativity and the effects of non-native interactions on the folding process.
HCC, or liver cancer, is a common cancer worldwide that is linked to certain risk factors, such as obesity, alcoholism, and viral hepatitis. These risk factors also cause stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in the liver, which leads to the unfolded protein response (UPR) or integrated stress response (ISR) pathways. However, it is not clear whether these stress pathways contribute to the development of HCC. A new study provides evidence that the ISR-regulated transcription factor CHOP promotes liver cancer. CHOP is expressed in liver tumors in humans and mice, and CHOP-null mice are resistant to chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. CHOP-null mice also have reduced inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. This study suggests that CHOP is a common factor in the development of HCC in various chronic liver diseases.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a chronic skin disease caused by parasites of the Leishmania genus that are transmitted by sandflies. These parasites target the skin and can cause a range of clinical manifestations, including localized CL (LCL) with ulcerative skin lesions, diffuse CL (DCL) with multiple lesions throughout the body, and mucocutaneous CL (MCL) with inflammation in the mucous membranes. While LCL often heals on its own, DCL and MCL are often difficult to treat and require systemic treatment. Despite the substantial burden of CL due to L aethiopica in Ethiopia, there is a lack of evidence-based treatment guidelines. We conducted a systematic review of clinical studies on treatment outcomes for CL due to L aethiopica, including studies on antimonials, pentamidine, cryotherapy, miltefosine, paromomycin, and liposomal amphotericin B. We found that antimonials, pentamidine, and cryotherapy have varying efficacy, while the evidence for other treatments is extremely limited. The evidence suggests that antimonials remain the most available treatment for CL in Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety should be further defined. Alternative first-line treatments, such as miltefosine or paromomycin, should be explored. High-quality trials on CL due to L aethiopica are urgently needed, especially those exploring group sequential methods to evaluate several options in parallel.
This study is about a biochemical oscillator that was reconstructed in a test tube using three purified proteins (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC) from a type of bacteria called Synechococcus elongatus. The researchers used electron microscopy and gel electrophoresis to determine how these three proteins interact with each other at different phases of the oscillation, and used this information to build a mathematical model of the oscillator that accurately reproduces the rhythms of the proteins. They also used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to confirm that the proteins are exchanging monomers (single molecules) during the reaction, which may be important for maintaining the high-amplitude oscillation. Finally, the researchers used temperature pulses to reset the phase of the oscillator, demonstrating that it can be entrained by external stimuli, like the circadian clocks in living organisms.
A recent study has found that across-trial variability in brain activity can correlate with behavioral performance independent of trial-averaged activity. This finding predicts a U- or inverted-U-shaped relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral output. Using a visual stimulus detection task, researchers have provided evidence from human electrocorticography (ECoG) for an inverted-U brain-behavior relationship. The study shows that when the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity is closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate is higher and reaction times faster. Importantly, the relationship is present not only in the post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity but also in the pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity. The authors further suggest that the inverted-U brain-behavior relationship is due to the presence of stochastic noise in the brain, as well as the dynamic interaction between the brain and the environment.
Scientists have analyzed the sex chromosomes, or MAT loci, of 24 species in the Trichosporonales order. They found that all of these species have bipolar MAT loci, which are physically linked and contain genes for mating compatibility. However, the alleles in the linked MAT loci are different from those in the pathogenic Cryptococci, suggesting that the fusion of the MAT loci occurred independently in the Trichosporonales and the pathogenic Cryptococci. Furthermore, the fused MAT loci of the Trichosporonales show a high degree of gene conservation and no evidence of recombination suppression, which is different from other fungal groups that have linked MAT loci. These findings suggest that the evolution of linked MAT loci is influenced by unique mechanisms in the Trichosporonales order.
Chagas disease is caused by a parasite and transmitted by triatomine insects in Latin America. Many regions have been successful in controlling triatomine insects inside houses through residual insecticide spraying, but triatomine insects that do not live in houses still cause a significant risk of transmission. Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the abundance of these non-domiciliated insects inside houses. The model was tested using field data and showed that it accurately predicted the abundance of these insects in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. The researchers then examined the efficacy of different control strategies for these insects, including residual insecticide spraying, insect screens, and bednets. Insect screens were found to be the most effective and sustainable control strategy.
Feathers are arranged in a precise pattern in avian skin. This pattern is generated by a reaction-diffusion-taxis system that is activated by Ectodysplasin A (EDA) and its receptor (EDAR), and involves fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, as well as mesenchymal cell movement. This system is mechanochemical, with a positive feedback loop centering on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation, mechanically compressing the epidermis to rapidly intensify FGF20 expression. The spreading wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of EDA, which initiates the expression of FGF20. EDA wave spreads across a mesenchymal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal cells required to begin to form a feather bud. The EDA wave spreads across a mesenchymal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal cells required to begin to form a feather bud. The development of feather tracts is lost in the flightless emu and ostrich, though via different developmental routes. The ostrich retains the tract arrangement characteristic of birds in general but lays down feather primordia without a wave, akin to the process of hair follicle formation in mammalian embryos. The embryonic emu skin lacks sufficient cells to enact feather formation, causing failure of tract formation, and instead the entire skin gains feather primordia through a later process.
The 2013–15 Ebola outbreak was unprecedented due to its occurrence in urban environments and the large number of survivors. In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that they didn't have enough evidence to determine which body fluids are infectious and when they pose a risk to humans. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of published evidence about the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors. We found 33 studies that met our criteria, but many of these studies had insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions. In most body fluids, prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Positive results from rapid polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were about four times more common than tissue culture results, and most test results came from more severe cases. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission, due to the high viral loads in blood. We recommend following WHO guidelines for sanitation and hygiene during outbreaks, and reviewing them regularly as new evidence becomes available.
Neurons are specialized cells in the nervous system that communicate with each other by sending and receiving electrical signals called action potentials or spikes. These spikes are generated by the movement of charged particles called ions in and out of the neuron's membrane. The movement of these ions is determined by the resistance and capacitance of the neuron's membrane, which define a single time constant that controls the timescale of the neuron's response. However, in real neurons, the movement of ions can follow multiple timescale dynamics due to the interaction of multiple active membrane conductances. This can result in power-law behavior, in which the membrane voltage cannot be characterized with a single time constant. To study these processes and their effect on neuronal behavior, a framework is needed that can account for multiple timescale dynamics. A fractional derivative is a mathematical tool that can be used to model these processes. In the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model, the exponent of the fractional derivative can vary from 0 to 1, and as it decreases, the weights of the voltage trace increase. This means that the value of the voltage is increasingly correlated with the trajectory of the voltage in the past. By varying the fractional exponent, this model can reproduce upward and downward spike adaptations found experimentally in pyramidal neurons and tectal neurons in vitro. The model also produces spikes with longer first-spike latency and high inter-spike variability with power-law distribution. The spiking activity of the fractional integrate-and-fire model deviates from the spiking activity of the classical integrate-and-fire model and reflects the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation. Overall, the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model is a powerful tool for studying the timescale dynamics of neuronal behavior and their effect on the electrical and computational capacities of neurons.
This research looked at how Paracoccidioides, a fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis, responds to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are harmful to the fungus. Paracoccidioides makes superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes to defend against the ROS. The study found six different SOD enzymes in Paracoccidioides. They looked at how much each of these enzymes were expressed in different phases of Paracoccidioides' life cycle and in different situations, such as when it was interacting with immune cells from humans or mice. They also used genetic engineering to see the effects of blocking these enzymes in Paracoccidioides. They found that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are involved in the response of the fungus to the host's immune system, particularly the oxidative stress response. They also found that PbSOD3 is more active outside of the fungal cell, while PbSOD1 is more important inside the cell. These findings provide new information about how Paracoccidioides responds to the host's immune system and can be used to develop new treatments for paracoccidioidomycosis.
The article discusses a new analysis of protein interactions in different organisms. The analysis is done using data from the IntAct database, which contains information about interactions between proteins from different organisms. The analysis is done separately for each organism to focus specifically on that organism's proteins. The data used in the analysis is from IntAct as of December 6, 2006. The analysis found that proteins that are intrinsically disordered and proteins that bind chaperones show a negative correlation in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoan species. This means that proteins that are intrinsically disordered are less likely to bind chaperones. The analysis also found that proteins that bind chaperones also tend to bind other proteins. The authors suggest that chaperone binding is primarily required for assembly with partners, rather than for folding, as previously thought. The article provides insight into the interactions of proteins in different organisms and how these interactions can be influenced by the properties of the proteins.
The Drosophila genes spalt major and spalt-related encode proteins that regulate the growth and patterning of the wing imaginal disc. In the wing disc, these proteins are controlled by the Dpp signaling pathway. The authors compared the expression profile of salm/salr knockdown wing discs with control discs using microarrays, and then used in situ hybridization to study the expression patterns of genes whose mRNA levels varied significantly. The authors uncovered a complex transcription landscape regulated by the Spalt proteins. They found that candidate Salm/Salr targets include genes whose expression is turned off and genes whose expression is positively regulated by Salm/Salr. The authors also found that loss-of-function phenotypic analysis of these genes indicates that for a fraction of them, a requirement for wing growth and patterning exists. The identification and analysis of candidate Salm/Salr target genes open a new avenue to understand the genetic structure of the wing disc, linking the activity of the Dpp pathway to the development of this tissue.
The paper is about a protein called ZYG-1, which is involved in the process of making new centrioles in C. elegans. The authors have discovered that two other proteins, GSP-1 and GSP-2, work with two other proteins, SDS-22 and I-2SZY-2, to control the level of ZYG-1 in the cell. By reducing the activity of PP1 (the protein that ZYG-1 regulates), they were able to rescue the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 mutation. They found that PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism, meaning that PP1 affects ZYG-1 after it has been made. They also found that moderate inhibition of PP1 activity can restore centriole duplication in a zyg-1 mutant, but strong inhibition of PP1 in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification. This means that PP1 controls the number of daughter centrioles produced each cycle, and that its activity needs to be tightly regulated in order to maintain appropriate centriole numbers.
The article is about a study on leishmaniasis, a disease spread by the parasite Leishmania infantum, in the city of Campinas, Brazil. The study found that the disease is being transmitted in two neighboring residential condominiums located inside an environmentally protected area. The study included the capture of sand flies and wild animals in these areas and the testing of dogs for leishmaniasis infection. The results of the study showed that the main vector of leishmaniasis in Brazil, Lutzomyia longipalpis, was found in one of the condominiums. The study also found that white-eared opossums, a known reservoir of leishmaniasis, were naturally infected with the parasite in two of the captured animals. The study highlights the importance of considering the different epidemiological profiles of leishmaniasis when developing prevention and control measures for the disease.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a type of virus that is known to cause many types of cancer, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). NPC is a type of cancer that affects the nasal cavity and throat. EBV produces small RNA molecules known as miRNAs that control the activity of proteins in cells. A previous study showed that a specific type of EBV miRNA, miR-BART9, is very highly expressed in all NPC tissues that were examined. In this study, researchers used techniques called gain-of-function and loss-of-function to investigate the effects of miR-BART9 on NPC cells. They discovered that miR-BART9 promotes the migration and invasiveness of NPC cells. This means that miR-BART9 makes NPC cells more likely to move and invade other parts of the body. In addition, the researchers found that miR-BART9 specifically targets and inhibits a protein called E-cadherin, which is important for maintaining the structure of epithelial cells. When miR-BART9 inhibits E-cadherin, it causes the cells to lose their structure and take on a more mesenchymal-like shape, which is associated with increased migration and invasiveness. These results suggest that miR-BART9 is a prometastatic viral miRNA that contributes to the aggressiveness of NPC cells.
Splicing events refer to changes that occur in the structure of a gene as it is transcribed into RNA, such as the insertion or removal of sections of the gene. Visualizing these events can help us understand how splicing affects gene expression and function. Ggsashimi is a new tool for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples, making it easier to compare and understand how splicing varies across different conditions or samples. Ggsashimi can take in a specified genomic region and create sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments, as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments. It also has the unique feature of being able to generate plots for very large genomic regions by scaling down the sections between splice sites. Ggsashimi is a command-line tool that is written in Python and can be downloaded from GitHub. It is easy to use and can be integrated into any splicing analysis pipeline. Ggsashimi is a useful tool for researchers and analysts working with large-scale RNA sequencing projects.
In this paper, the authors propose a model to predict and align cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across species. CRMs are segments of DNA that regulate gene expression. To do this, the model takes into account the evolutionary history of the CRM, as well as the specific transcription factors (TFs) that bind to it. The model also includes a probabilistic approach to handle uncertainties in TFBS annotations and sequence alignment. The authors demonstrate that their model outperforms existing methods for CRM prediction and alignment in simulated and real data. They also use their model to study the conservation of TFBSs in Drosophila blastoderm and found that functional TFBSs are not always conserved, and that binding sites in distal bound sequences are more conserved than those in proximal regions. The authors implemented their model as software, called EMMA (Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module Analysis), which is ready to be used in a broad biological context.
The piRNA pathway is an important defense mechanism in Drosophila that protects the genome from transposons and other repetitive elements during embryogenesis. Mutations in several piRNA pathway genes have been shown to cause axis specification defects and embryonic lethality. Our study has identified a novel function for the piRNA pathway in telomere protection, which is mediated by a subset of piRNAs that are bound by Piwi protein. These piRNAs are independent of Chk2 activation and DNA damage signaling, and are likely to play a distinct role from the previously established role of piRNAs in transposon silencing.
In late November 2007, there was an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in the townships of Bundibugyo and Kikyo in Uganda. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducted tests on blood samples from suspect cases and found evidence of ebolavirus infection in eight samples. The virus was identified as a new species of ebolavirus, which was proposed to be named Bundibugyo ebolavirus. The virus was distantly related to Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus, which caused a single non-fatal case 14 years ago in Ivory Coast. The outbreak resulted in 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths. The entire genome of the virus was completed using a combination of random primed pyrosequencing and primer walking approaches. The analysis revealed that Bundibugyo ebolavirus differed from the four existing ebolavirus species, with approximately 32% nucleotide difference from even the closest relative. The virus surface glycoprotein, which is an important determinant of virus tropism and pathogenicity, differs between Bundibugyo and Côte d'Ivoire and Zaire ebolaviruses by over 27 and 35% at the amino acid level, respectively. The unique nature of this virus has other implications too, including screening of potential antivirals and pathogenicity studies. Retrospective analysis of case description, epidemiologic and laboratory data from the Bundibugyo outbreak are still ongoing.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a type of dementia that affects older people. Different people with AD can have different rates of progression, which means that the disease can develop at different speeds. There have been reports on the different rates of progression in AD, but there has not been a study that measured the amount of variability in the progression of the disease. This study looked at a cohort of 648 people with AD and their average follow-up time of 4.78 years. The study found that the standard deviations for the duration of stages 4 to 6 of AD were similar to their mean values. This indicates that there is a lot of variability in the progression of AD among different people. It is important to take this variability into account when designing and evaluating treatments for AD. This study also looked at the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and the Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) procedures, which are commonly used to stage AD. The GDS and FAST procedures are based on different measurements, but they both divide AD into different stages. The study found that the GDS and FAST procedures have a similar staging system, but there are some differences between the two. The study also looked at the course of AD as characterized by the GDS and FAST procedures, and found that each stage of AD has a certain duration. However, the study also found that the duration of each stage can vary widely among different people. This is important to keep in mind when evaluating treatments for AD.
The study presented in this article examines the functional relevance of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. The authors have developed a mathematical model that simulates the process of adult neurogenesis in a hippocampal network that is required to adapt to changing input statistics. The study compared different adaptation strategies, such as conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis, and found that additive neurogenesis is the most effective adaptation strategy. The study also examined the time course of neurogenesis and the role of place cells in the model. The findings of this study provide further evidence for the functional relevance of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
African trypanosomes are parasites that cause sleeping sickness in humans and Nagana in cattle. These parasites have three very similar non-selenium glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) that help to break down toxic molecules inside the cells. Feeding these GPx-deficient parasites with a certain substance called Trolox can rescue them. The researchers found that in the absence of Trolox, the parasites die due to lysosomal disintegration, followed by damage of the mitochondrion and other cellular membranes. The endocytic uptake of iron ions is closely linked to this process. These findings reveal an unprecedented biological role of cytosolic thiol peroxidases and will have a strong impact on research in other human pathogens and mammalian hosts.
PMEL is a protein that helps make black and brown hair in animals. It's important for making the color of hair, and without it, animals can't produce these colors. Some people have mutations in their genes that affect the way PMEL makes color. These mutations can cause problems like lighter or white hair. In this study, scientists created a mouse with a gene that makes PMEL unable to do its job. These mice still have some color in their hair, but it's not as dark as normal. This shows that PMEL is important for making color in animals.
Dengue fever is a common disease that spreads rapidly through mosquito bites. Vector control is the main way to prevent dengue infections, but it is difficult to control mosquito populations. Environmental interventions are a promising way to reduce the spread of dengue since they do not have risks of environmental contamination and toxicity. The study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of different environmental methods for dengue vector control. The study found that each of the investigated methods had some effectiveness in reducing the population of mosquitoes, but more research is needed to strengthen this evidence.
The study aims to identify small molecules that can selectively stall the ribosome and reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The authors used a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify proteins and pathways that affect cell growth in the presence of high doses of a selective PCSK9 translational inhibitor (PF-06378503). They found that ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3, which bind to the ribosome, protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. Surprisingly, translation quality control proteins Pelota and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. Taken together, these results identify new connections between ribosome quality control pathways, and provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation.
Scientists have discovered that a virus called Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) can destroy a lot of the messages (RNA) made by a person's cells. This happens because the virus makes a protein called SOX that can turn off gene expression and shut down the cell. SOX works by changing the polyadenylation of the messages. Polyadenylation is a process where a small amount of the building block of RNA, called adenosine, is added to the end of a message. This process is usually used to protect messages from being destroyed. However, SOX causes aberrant polyadenylation, which is a process where a lot of adenosine is added to the end of messages. This can cause the messages to be destroyed. Scientists found that SOX can only cause messages to be destroyed if both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly (A) binding proteins are involved. This finding suggests that SOX is directing a new way for messages to be destroyed, and that polyadenylation is linked to RNA destruction in higher eukaryotes.
The type III interferon ( IFNλ ) receptor IL-28R is abundantly expressed in the respiratory tract and has been shown essential for host defense against some viral pathogens, but no data are available concerning its role in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens. In this study, the researchers examined the importance of type III interferons in the innate immune response to two major airway pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They found that IFNλ was induced in the course of bacterial airway infection and resulted in downregulation of the microRNA miR-21, sustained expression of PDCD4, and increased proinflammatory cytokine production. Mice lacking the IFNλ receptor or PDCD4 had significantly improved clearance of both airway pathogens and less pulmonary pathology associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines.
This study looked at the mortality rate and risk factors for a type of sleeping sickness called HAT (Human African Trypanosomiasis) among 781 people with advanced stage-2 HAT who were admitted to a hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1989 and 2012. The risk factors that were looked at included the patient's age, gender, the length of time the patient had the illness, the part of their body where the parasites were found, their clinical status on admission, and the treatment they received. The treatment regimens included a standard melarsoprol schedule, a short melarsoprol schedule, a drug called eflornithine, and a combination of eflornithine and a drug called nifurtimox. The study found that the most important predictors of death were the patient's clinical status on admission, the presence of parasites in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the level of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid. These findings can help doctors to better understand the risk of death for people with HAT and to develop better treatment options.
In this study, the authors developed a new imaging arena and improved the existing tracking algorithm to reliably follow a large number of flies simultaneously. They then designed an algorithm to quantify changes in the social network in response to prior social isolation. They found that isolation significantly and swiftly enhanced individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. They explored the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and found that whereas behavior changed throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occurred mostly on day one. The authors conclude that their study provides a powerful pipeline to unravel the behavioral, molecular and physiological impact of isolation on social network dynamics in Drosophila.
This study aimed to improve clinical care for patients with diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings by creating a smartphone app based on World Health Organization guidelines. The app was designed to help doctors estimate a child's weight, determine the appropriate amount of fluids and medications to use, and assess the child's dehydration. The app was tested in two hospitals in Bangladesh, which did not have scales. The study found that the app improved doctors' adherence to the guidelines in several ways. Doctors prescribed the recommended antibiotic more often, used the recommended fluid resuscitation amount more often, and used the recommended zinc supplement more often. However, there were limitations to the study, including the lack of a control group and the fact that doctors were not blinded to which patients used the app. Despite these limitations, the study suggests that smartphone apps can be a useful tool for improving clinical care for patients with diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings.
Infectious diseases are sensitive to environmental changes, especially temperature. However, it is difficult to predict how host-parasite systems will respond to climate change because host and parasite traits may have different temperature dependencies that need to be taken into account. Researchers used experimental data from a freshwater crustacean (Daphnia magna) and its parasite (Ordospora colligata) to fit a mathematical model of within-host parasite population dynamics. They used parameters from host aging and mortality, as well as parasite growth, virulence, and equilibrium abundance, that were specified by relationships arising from the metabolic theory of ecology. The model accurately predicted host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature. This study shows that linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host-parasite framework can be used to predict the temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. This approach has the potential to be applied to other host-parasite systems and may help us better understand the impacts of climate change on disease.
The article focuses on the role of GABAergic interneurons in shaping the activity of excitatory cells. The authors propose a functional role for a specific network motif consisting of parvalbumin- (PV), somatostatin- (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons. They suggest that mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM cells amplifies weak inputs to VIP interneurons into large changes in somato-dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells. The authors also show that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to switch between two processing modes, depending on the strength of the input. They provide a mathematical analysis and simulations of a microcircuit consisting of these three interneuron types and excitatory PCs to support their hypothesis.
The human body is home to many microorganisms, collectively known as the microbiome. These microorganisms can have a big impact on our bodies, affecting things like our mental health, weight, and overall health. Researchers have studied the microbiome to see how it is related to different diseases, like diabetes, arthritis, cancer, autism and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the results of these studies have been conflicting, and many associations have been found between microorganisms and diseases that are not actually linked. To address this problem, a team of scientists developed a new method to remove these spurious associations and focus on the ones that are truly linked to the disease. They applied this method to a large study of IBD and found that the majority of the previously reported associations could be explained by interactions between different microorganisms in the gut. This means that these associations were not actually linked to the disease itself, but were caused by other factors. The scientists also found that a small number of microorganisms were directly linked to the disease, including Roseburia, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Blautia producta, Turicibacter, Oscillospira, Eubacterium dolichum, Aggregatibacter segnis, and Sutterella. These microorganisms are known to be important for overall health and may play a role in the development of IBD. The scientists also found that these direct associations were much better at distinguishing between people with the disease and healthy people than associations that were not directly linked to the disease. This new method of analyzing microbiome data can help scientists to better understand how the microbiome is related to disease and to identify the microorganisms that are most important for our health.
Insects, such as mosquitoes, can carry pathogens that can cause diseases in humans and animals. Wolbachia is a type of bacteria that can infect mosquitoes and reduce the transmission of these pathogens. In this study, the researchers compared the effect of Wolbachia on two flaviviruses (dengue virus and West Nile virus) in two types of infected mosquitoes: stable and transient. The stable infected mosquitoes were infected with Wolbachia and the infection was maintained in their offspring. The transient infected mosquitoes were injected with Wolbachia and the bacteria remained in their body for only a few days. The researchers found that Wolbachia blocked the replication and transmission of both viruses in both types of infected mosquitoes. However, the blocking effect was significantly lower in the transient infected mosquitoes. This study provides further evidence for the potential use of Wolbachia as a natural control method for mosquito-borne pathogens.
Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that play a critical role in cell signaling. They are composed of a basal body, a transition zone, a doublet region, and a singlet region. The doublet region is a portion of the cilia shaft adjacent to the transition zone. The InvC, a distinct region of the cilia shaft, is composed of components such as NPHP-2, NPHP3, NEK8, and ANKS6. The InvC is important for signal transduction and amplification, cilia placement, and ciliogenesis. The current study used genetic and structural analyses to examine the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the C . elegans doublet region and InvC. The study found that the InvC is conserved in C . elegans, is established early in development, and is distinct from the doublet region. NPHP-2, ARL-13, and UNC-119 localize to the InvC and require their calcium binding EF hand domain for targeting. The study also found that nphp-2, arl-13, and unc-119 fall into two redundant genetic modules. The genetic modules modulate the sizes of the NPHP-2 InvC and ARL-13 doublet region, and glutamylation, a tubulin post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting of InvC and doublet region components. The study concludes that the C . elegans InvC is distinct from the doublet region, and that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization.
Researchers have found that Scribble, a protein involved in cell polarity, is important for myelination and remyelination in the brain. Scribble is expressed in oligodendrocytes, the cells that make the myelin sheath in the brain, and is needed for the myelin sheath to form properly. When Scribble expression is removed, the myelin sheath does not form correctly. This finding suggests that Scribble may be a target for developing new treatments for diseases that cause myelin loss, such as multiple sclerosis.
This paper talks about a type of bacteria that can make a toxic and harmful substance called Streptolysin S (SLS). SLS can damage and kill cells, and it makes the bacteria more likely to spread. This substance is made by some bacteria in the same way that other bacteria make antibiotics. The paper explains that there are some other bacteria that can make a similar substance, and it talks about how this substance can help some bacteria to survive and spread. The paper also explains that the bacteria that make SLS are related to other bacteria that can make this substance, and it talks about how some of these bacteria can produce it too. The paper also explains that different strains of bacteria can produce different substances that are related to SLS.
Mycetoma is a painful, inflammatory disease that affects the skin and soft tissues, often resulting in disfigurement, disability, and reduced quality of life. This disease is caused by either fungal or bacterial organisms that form "grains," which are surrounded by an inflammatory response. However, the immune response that leads to the formation of these grains and the specific expression of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in mycetoma lesions are not well understood. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma lesions and their correlation with clinical characteristics of the patients. The study included 100 patients with confirmed mycetoma, and their biopsies were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The results showed that IL-17 was mainly expressed in zones 1 and 2, while MMP-9 was mainly expressed in zones 2 and 3. MMP-9 expression was higher in Actinomadura pelletieri and Streptomyces somaliensis biopsies compared to Madurella mycetomatis biopsies. Moreover, the expression of IL-17 and MMP-9 were directly proportional to each other. The only significant association between MMP9 and patients' characteristics was the duration of the disease. There was an insignificant correlation between the expression of IL-17 and patients' demographic characteristics. This study provides valuable insights into the immune response that leads to the formation of mycetoma granulomas and suggests that IL-17 and MMP-9 may be potential targets for therapeutic interventions in mycetoma.
The article is about a specific type of recognition that takes place between disordered proteins called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and target proteins. This recognition does not require the IDP to change its structure, but instead it recognizes the target in its disordered state. This phenomenon is referred to as fuzziness and is characterized by polyvalency, sequence insensitivity and a variety of disordered bound-state conformations. The article describes a specific IDP called the transcriptional activation domain of the Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family (EAD), which exhibits many features of fuzziness. To understand this recognition process, the authors propose a model called the polycation-π model, which suggests that EAD recognizes the target by making polycation-π contacts with basic residues on the target. The authors tested this model by performing a range of experiments and molecular simulations. Their results show that the model is consistent with the experimental data and can be used to understand the molecular recognition process of EAD. This study highlights the importance of cation-π interactions in protein-protein recognition and suggests that this type of recognition is a general concept for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs.
The article "Lon Proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi: A Comparative Study" by M. K. Johnson, S. M. O'Connor, E. J. Hodges, J. W. Collins, A. A. W. Rutherford, and A. J. Stark discusses the Lon proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Specifically, they discuss Lon-1 and Lon-2, two proteins that have been identified in B. burgdorferi but not in other bacterial species. The authors describe the structure and function of these proteins, as well as their potential role in the adaptation of B. burgdorferi to its host. They also compare Lon-1 and Lon-2 to the Lon proteins of other bacteria, highlighting their unique features. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the Lon proteins of B. burgdorferi and their potential role in the survival and adaptation of this important human pathogen.
The paper investigates the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in preventing HIV infection. ADP is a process where antibody-opsonized virions or cells with viral antigens are internalized into phagocytic cells. To determine if HIV-specific antibodies mediate this process, researchers used several phagocytic cells (THP-1, U937, and freshly isolated primary monocytes) and virions decorated with gp41 or gp41-derived peptides. They found that minimal or no ADP of virions occurred with any of the antibodies. However, when gp41-specific mAbs were used, efficient phagocytosis occurred. The researchers estimated that a minimum of a few hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagocytosis, which is similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses that are readily phagocytosed (e.g., influenza virus). The researchers also found that virion-decorated cells were targets for phagocytosis or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. In conclusion, the paper suggests that ADP of virions may not play a role in preventing HIV infection, likely due to the paucity of trimers and the consequent inability of virion-bound antibody to cross-link FcyRs on phagocytes. On the other hand, ADP or trogocytosis could play a role in clearing HIV-infected cells and cells on the verge of infection.
Hookworms are intestinal parasites that infect millions of people worldwide, and their economic and health impact is not well known. Hookworm infections can lead to anemia, malnutrition, lethargy, impaired physical and cognitive development, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. It is difficult for decision-makers to determine how much time, energy, and resources to invest in controlling hookworms because of the lack of information on their economic and health burden. Therefore, we created a computational simulation model to estimate the economic and health burden of hookworms globally and in different countries. Our model used disability weight estimates to calculate DALYs, which is a measure of the number of healthy years lost due to a disease. We found that hookworm infections resulted in millions of DALYs worldwide in 2016, with even more DALYs when cognitive impairment was included. Productivity losses from hookworm infections varied depending on the probability of anemia and calculation method used, ranging from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages. Hookworms cause more subtle chronic health problems, making it difficult for decision-makers to determine the economic and health burden. Our computational simulation model can help decision-makers to allocate time, energy, and resources to effectively control hookworms.
The research group studied the effects of developmental hypoxia on axon guidance in zebrafish. The study used the zebrafish model to investigate hypoxia during different stages of brain development. The team generated transgenic zebrafish to test the genetic pathways involved in hypoxia-induced guidance errors. The research found that hypoxia-induced pathfinding errors are caused by the activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif1) pathway and are mimicked by chemical inducers of the hif1 pathway. Further, the team discovered that a protein called ephrinB2 is a target of the hif1 pathway and is responsible for the pathfinding errors. The study also showed that a protein called ephA4 is complementary to the misrouting axons. The team found that a constitutively active form of ephrinB2a could mediate the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism. Finally, the study found that magnesium sulfate, which is used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against the pathfinding errors by preventing the upregulation of ephrinB2a. Overall, the study demonstrated that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the developing brain in response to hypoxia, and it supports the potential neuroprotective role of magnesium sulfate in preterm births.
In this study, the authors compared the use of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to conventional histopathological methods in the study of lung damage in mice infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, a fungus that causes a chronic progressive disease called human paracoccidioidomycosis. The authors found that HRCT is a useful tool for the evaluation and quantification of lung damage in the experimental model of PCM in mice, as it allows the monitoring of disease progression over time. HRCT images can provide information on the three-dimensional distribution of lesions throughout the lung volume, which is not possible with conventional histological analysis or pulmonary function tests in live animals. The study suggests that HRCT can be used as a non-invasive tool to monitor treatment efficacy in the experimental model of PCM in mice.
This study proposes a new way to test for latent Leishmania donovani infections. The test is based on a whole-blood assay that measures the cell-mediated immune response to specific leishmania antigens. The test was evaluated on blood samples from active and cured visceral leishmaniasis patients, healthy endemic controls, and healthy non-endemic controls. The test based on soluble leishmania antigen (SLA) had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 100%. The test's findings suggest that it can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infections. However, the positive IFN-γ response to stimulation with leishmania antigen in patients with active visceral leishmaniasis was contradictory to the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and needs further research.
A new study has found that a bacterial toxin called CNFY is responsible for causing inflammation that eventually leads to the clearance of enteropathogenic yersiniae from the body. Suppression of CNFY function, however, promotes the establishment of a commensal-type life-style for the bacteria, making them persist in the body and leading to autoimmune disorders. This study has provided important insights into the mechanisms underlying persistent infections and will contribute to the development of new therapies for these infections.
In order to be successful and reproduce in plant hosts, pathogens must overcome the plant's innate defense system. A new pathogenicity gene in Magnaporthe oryzae, called DES1, has been identified and it helps the fungus counteract host defense mechanisms. The DES1 gene codes for a serine-rich protein that has unknown biochemical properties and is only found in filamentous Ascomycetes. Targeted deletion of DES1 showed that it is not involved in fungal development, but it did result in the fungus being hypersensitive to oxidative stress. The fungus was also unable to penetrate the host plant and caused a decrease in pathogenicity. In addition, plant defense mechanisms were activated, including the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the accumulation of brown granules in primary infected cells. The results suggest that DES1 is a pathogenicity factor that counters host defense mechanisms by restraining the oxidative component of PTI.
The study aims to determine the accuracy of using model-based geostatistics (MBG) to predict the prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection in Ghana. The study found that using the mean predicted values alone, 21 of the 25 empirically determined "high-risk" schools requiring yearly praziquantel would have been undertreated, and almost 20% of the remaining schools would have been treated despite empirically-determined absence of infection. This translates into 28% of the children in the 79 schools being undertreated and 12% receiving treatment in the absence of any demonstrated need. Therefore, the study suggests that the current predictive map for Ghana is not adequate for guiding the national program and that predictive risk mapping should be an iterative process that incorporates empiric testing and model refining to create updated versions that meet the needs of disease control operational managers.
Prostaglandins are important molecules that help sperm find oocytes and eventually fertilize them. In a recent study, researchers found that Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) oocytes make a group of prostaglandins from certain fatty acids that are provided in the yolk lipoprotein complexes. The researchers used genetic and chemical analyses to study the pathway of prostaglandin synthesis in C. elegans. They found that multiple prostaglandins work together to guide sperm towards oocytes. They also found that a conserved enzyme called CYP-6A14 in humans and CeCYP-6A14 in C. elegans play a role in regulating prostaglandin synthesis. The results of this study support the idea that prostaglandins are important molecules for sperm guidance and fertilization in C. elegans.
This paper describes a new approach to designing biotherapeutic proteins that are both effective and have low immunogenicity. The approach involves using algorithms to optimize the design of proteins for both high-level function and reduced T cell epitope content. By doing this, the authors identified a set of Pareto-optimal variants that balance the two objectives. The authors then built and evaluated these variants experimentally, and found that they maintained their functionality while reducing immunogenicity. This approach may be useful in accelerating and de-risking experimental deimmunization efforts.
Sexual reproduction is a fundamental process for most eukaryotes that requires meiosis. In turn, meiosis requires a reciprocal exchange of DNA between each pair of homologous chromosomes, known as crossovers. The frequency and distribution of crossovers are regulated by internal and external environmental factors. Here, the authors show that elevated temperature induces meiotic hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana and demonstrate that the extra crossovers are derived from the major Type I interference sensitive pathway. They also show that heat-induced crossovers occur without an increase in meiotic double-strand breaks and that the hyper-recombination phenotype is likely specific to thermal stress rather than a more generalized stress response.
There are many different types of tools available to help scientists analyze large amounts of biological data. Some of these tools use computers to combine information from various sources and come up with new hypotheses. One of these tools is called Hanalyzer. Hanalyzer was used on a large dataset of gene expression results related to the development of the face. By using Hanalyzer, the scientists were able to generate new hypotheses about the role of four genes in face development. These hypotheses were then tested through further experiments. Overall, Hanalyzer is a useful tool for helping scientists make sense of large amounts of biological data.
The liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, secretes tiny sacs called extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be taken up by host immune cells to help the fluke avoid being detected by the host's immune system. These vesicles contain many different molecules that can help the fluke cause disease in its host. In this study, the authors used a biotin reagent to capture proteins on the surface of two types of EVs (called 15k and 120k EVs) released by the fluke. They then used mass spectrometry to identify the proteins on the surface of these EVs. The authors also used a lectin microarray to analyze the sugars displayed on the surface of these EVs as they would be seen by the host. They found that both types of EVs have high mannose sugars on their surface, but they are different in other ways. The authors found that EVs that are released from the fluke gut are more likely to be taken up by host immune cells than those that are released from the excretory system. They also found that antibodies raised against proteins found on the surface of the EVs can enhance their uptake by host immune cells. These results help us understand how the fluke's EVs interact with host immune cells.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small molecules that regulate many biological processes in plants, and they are produced from long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. In this study, we identified a cycling DOF transcription factor named CDF2 that binds directly to the promoters of some miRNA genes and affects DCL1-mediated processing of these pri-miRNAs. CDF2 regulates a group of pri-miRNAs at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels to maintain proper levels of their mature miRNAs, which helps control plant development.
Folliculogenesis is the development of a female's eggs. It involves communication between the oocyte (egg) and granulosa cells, which provides the oocyte with necessary nutrients for growth. The authors found that geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) is required for this communication and for the growth of the oocyte. GGPP is produced in the oocyte and it helps to regulate the activity of Rho GTPases, which are important for cell communication. Without GGPP, the physical connection between the oocyte and granulosa cells is disrupted, which leads to problems in the oocyte's growth and the transition from primary to secondary follicles. The authors also found that GGPP helps with the secretion of important proteins from the oocyte, such as Gdf9.
The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is an important enzyme in the process of transcription, where it synthesizes messenger RNA (mRNA) using DNA as a template. It has been suggested that there are two possible routes for the entry of nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) into the active site of Pol II: the secondary channel and the main channel. However, there is currently no complete picture of how the NTP enters Pol II through the main channel, and it is unclear if this route is significant. In this study, a structural model was built of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble, which is the region of DNA that separates and bends at the downstream edge of the transcription bubble. The model was then used for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the diffusion of NTP through the channels. The results of these simulations showed that both the secondary channel and the main channel are possible routes for NTP entry, but that the secondary channel is more significant.
Dengue is a common but under-reported disease that causes high morbidity and mortality, especially in children and young adults. The authors used information from a prospective cohort study to estimate the burden of dengue in Thailand and Cambodia. The study found that the true number of dengue cases is significantly higher than the number of reported cases, and the authors recommend using multiplication factors derived from prospective cohort studies to more accurately estimate disease burden.
In this study, the researchers investigated the role of natural killer ( NK ) cells in promoting antiviral immune responses. They used a mouse model of cytomegalovirus ( MCMV ) infection to determine the effects of efficient and inefficient NK cell activation on the development of adaptive immune responses. The researchers found that NK cells can accelerate CD8 T cell responses against a viral infection in vivo. They identified the underlying mechanism as the ability of NK cells to limit pDC IFN-α/β production, which can have immunosuppressive effects on the host. The researchers suggest that understanding the role of NK cells in antiviral immune responses may lead to the development of innovative treatments for viral infections.
In this study, we discovered four different types of rRNA genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant commonly used for scientific research. Two of these rRNA genes are always active, while the other two are either repressed or have no activity. We found that one of the inactive rRNA genes becomes active in plants that lack a protein called nucleolin. This protein helps control which rRNA genes are active and which are not. We also found that the active rRNA genes have DNA that is highly methylated, while the inactive rRNA genes do not have as much methylation. This suggests that the amount of methylation on DNA might play a role in deciding which rRNA genes are active. We hope this information will help us understand how rRNA genes work and how they are controlled in plants.
The article focuses on the role of histone deacetylation in regulating human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) gene expression during the infection process. The authors used a method called rapid immunoisolation to identify candidate HDAC1-interacting proteins in the context of HCMV infection, which included several human cytomegalovirus-coded proteins such as pUL38 and pUL29/28. The authors confirmed the interaction of pUL38 and pUL29/28 with HDAC1 using reciprocal immunoprecipitations. They also showed that the NuRD complex, a protein complex involved in chromatin remodeling and deacetylation, was associated with both pUL38 and pUL29/28. The authors demonstrated that blocking the expression of NuRD components inhibited the replication of HCMV, suggesting that NuRD is important for efficient HCMV replication. They also showed that full activation of the HCMV major immediate-early promoter required pUL29/28 but not pUL38, suggesting that pUL29/28 may play a more important role in enhancing HCMV gene expression. The authors propose that HCMV may co-opt NuRD function in order to enhance expression of its immediate-early genes.
The purpose of this study is to understand the antibody repertoire following primary Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection and its evolution through adolescence and adulthood. Phage display libraries were used for unbiased epitope profiling of infant sera before and after RSV infection. The results showed that the antibody response to F protein epitopes increased steadily from young children to adults, while the antibody response to G protein epitopes declined significantly in adults. Several novel epitopes were identified in pre-fusion F and an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27. Furthermore, the study found an unlinked evolution of the antibody responses to F and G proteins, which provides important information for the development of effective countermeasures including vaccines.
Filariae are parasitic worms that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. Filariae cause diseases such as elephantiasis and river blindness. There are several species of filariae that cause disease, including Brugia malayi, which causes lymphatic filariasis. Current treatments only kill the larval form of the worm, not the adult form. This means that people need to be treated repeatedly over a long period of time to control the disease. However, a new drug called emodepside, which has been shown to be effective against adult filariae, has the potential to change this. Emodepside works by activating voltage-gated potassium channels. However, the specific isoform of this channel that emodepside targets is not known. In this study, researchers investigated how emodepside works in the adult form of Brugia malayi by using a patch-clamp technique to measure the activity of individual muscle cells. They also used a technique called RNAi knock down to determine which isoform of the channel is targeted by emodepside. Their findings suggest that the male worm is more sensitive to emodepside than the female worm. This study provides valuable information about how emodepside works in the adult form of Brugia malayi and could help in the development of more effective treatments for filarial diseases.
The article is about developing better diagnostic tests for two different diseases: lymphatic filariasis (LF) and loiasis. LF is a disease caused by worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes and can lead to disfigurement and disability. Loiasis is a disease caused by a different type of worm that is also transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause symptoms such as itching and swelling. Currently, diagnostic tests for LF use antibodies that recognize a specific protein from the worm that causes LF. However, these tests can also give false positive results for loiasis. To better understand the nature of this cross-reactivity, researchers used antibodies that recognize proteins from the worm that causes LF to immunoaffinity purify proteins from the blood of people with loiasis. They found many different proteins that were reactive with the antibodies and suggested that they could be released by dying worms and used to develop better diagnostic tests for both diseases.
The cilium is a specialized organelle found on most eukaryotic cells. It has important functions in cell signaling and development. Defects in cilia lead to a range of diseases known as ciliopathies, which can affect multiple organs and physiological processes. To identify new cilium-associated genes, researchers used the nematode worm C. elegans to create a list of candidate genes from RNA-Seq libraries. They then confirmed that some of these genes are cilium-localized in worms. Among them is RAB-28, a protein that is associated with the BBSome, a complex involved in cilium formation and function. Overexpression of RAB-28 in worms leads to ciliary and cell non-autonomous sensory pore defects. This work provides a new approach to finding new ciliary proteins and uncovers a functional association between the BBSome, IFT, and RAB28.
The brain is responsible for representing the environment around us. But, how does it do this? One way that the brain might represent the environment is through the use of cells called place cells. Place cells are found in the hippocampus and fire in a specific location in space, called a place field. In this study, researchers investigated what can be learned about the environment using the spikes of place cells. They discovered that by analyzing which groups of place cells fire together, they could extract global topological features of the environment, and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of space within which the animal's position could be tracked. They used standard tools from algebraic topology and graph theory to do this. Their findings suggest that the brain may use different methods to represent the environment around us, and that it may not need to rely on place fields or precise spike timing to do this.

This study evaluated the hookworm infection prevalence and species-specific infection load in pre-school children in Malawi and their association with severe anemia and bone marrow iron deficiency using multiplex real-time PCR. The study found that the prevalence of Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus infections was 26.1% and 4.9%, respectively, with a higher prevalence of moderate and high load A. duodenale infections being associated with severe anemia and bone marrow iron deficiency. This study highlights the importance of species-specific hookworm screening for the diagnosis and treatment of severe anemia and iron deficiency in children living in resource-poor settings.
The article discusses the role of COM-1, a protein found in the Caenorhabditis elegans worm, in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis. Meiosis is a specialized form of cell division that occurs in germ cells to produce gametes, the cells that make up sperm and eggs. During meiosis, DNA double-strand breaks are introduced into the DNA, which then need to be repaired in order for the cell to continue dividing. There are two main ways to repair DNA double-strand breaks: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR is considered to be more accurate than NHEJ, but it also requires an undamaged template, which is not always available. In C. elegans, COM-1 is required to block NHEJ activity and ensure that DNA double-strand breaks are repaired via HR. This ensures that the cell can divide correctly and produce healthy gametes.
Melioidosis is a serious and sometimes fatal disease caused by the bacteria Burkholderia pseudomallei and is particularly common in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. A goat model for aerosol infection that mimics human melioidosis has been developed to study the humoral immune response. The immune response was monitored by ELISA and western blot, and the antigenic proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. It was found that IgG antibodies were the main humoral immune response and reactive to a range of antigens. The heat shock protein GroEL was found to be the most immunogenic protein. The study highlights the potential of using this goat model to study the immune response to melioidosis and to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers.
In this article, the authors describe how they developed a new approach to investigate the activation of mitotic cyclin B1–Cdk1 complexes in live human cells. By using a combination of immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, the authors were able to track the development of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity in real-time. They found that cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity increased gradually during early mitosis, and that a critical threshold level of activity was required to drive mitotic entry. The authors also discovered that high levels of Cdk1 activity were needed for normal mitotic progression, and that a different threshold level of activity was required to initiate anaphase. These findings provide important insights into how the activity of mitotic cyclin B1–Cdk1 complexes is regulated in human cells.
HIV-1 vaccines have not been able to generate neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) that protect against various HIV-1 subtypes. We looked at the neutralizing antibody responses of 21 Kenyan women who were superinfected with HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D, about 1.07 years after their initial infection. We collected their plasma samples at a median time of 2.72 years after superinfection. Previous studies have shown that the majority of broad and potent neutralizing activity in singly infected individuals can be mapped to four main epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope, which include the CD4-binding site, a V1/V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41. We focused on these targets and found that superinfection did not induce a dominant neutralizing antibody response to any one of these epitopes. Computational analyses also suggested that 20 of the 21 superinfected women's neutralizing antibody responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These data suggest that superinfection with diverse HIV-1 subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal neutralizing antibody response. This study provides support for vaccine designs that use multivalent HIV immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of neutralizing antibodies.
Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection can cause serious brain development problems in babies. We have studied this infection in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are important for brain development. We have found that HCMV infection reduces the levels of Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes1) protein in infected NPCs. We also found that the immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) of HCMV is involved in this reduction. Our study suggests that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels by causing IE1 to assemble a ubiquitination complex and promote Hes1 ubiquitination, leading to proteasomal degradation. This study provides new information about HCMV infection and its role in brain development disorders.
In this study, we compared how changes in gene expression occur in different species of flies from the same genus, which have evolved over millions of years. We looked at how closely gene expression patterns match the binding of transcription factors that play a role in early embryonic development. We found that although gene expression levels are quite similar across species, the binding of transcription factors is much more varied. Additionally, we noticed that highly bound sites, binding sites in regions where multiple factors bind, and binding sites near genes are more likely to be conserved across species. This suggests that some of the binding of transcription factors may not be important and may not be subject to evolutionary pressures. Overall, our study provides important information about how changes in gene expression occur in different species and how they are related to changes in transcription factor binding.
This study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis in India. The program involves mass drug administration to people who are at risk of being infected with the disease. The study found that there were still areas with high levels of infection, despite the mass drug administration program. These areas are known as "hotspots" and are important to monitor because they can lead to new cases of infection. The study also found that it is important to use good surveillance strategies to detect hotspots and to adopt evidence-based sampling strategies and evaluation unit size for Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS). This information can help guide the development of more effective ways to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.
Dengue is a disease transmitted by mosquitoes, and controlling the mosquitoes is important in preventing the spread of the disease. A common method for controlling mosquitoes is using the insecticide temephos in water storage containers. This review aims to assess the effectiveness of temephos in controlling dengue when used as a single intervention or in combination with other interventions. The authors searched for relevant studies and found that temephos consistently reduced the number of mosquito larvae when used alone, but not when used in combination with other interventions. The effectiveness of temephos also varied depending on factors such as water quality and environmental conditions. While temephos may be effective in reducing the number of mosquitoes, there is no evidence to suggest that it reduces the spread of dengue.
The article discusses the role of two proteins, Ctf19 and Csm3, in cohesion at the pericentromere, a specific region on the chromosomes that is particularly enriched in cohesin proteins. Ctf19 and Csm3 are important for establishing cohesion at the pericentromere but work through different mechanisms. Ctf19 is involved in loading cohesin onto the pericentromere before DNA replication, while Csm3 is involved in the subsequent step of ensuring that cohesin is incorporated into functional linkages that hold sister chromatids together. The article suggests that these proteins work together to ensure that chromosomes are properly divided during cell division.
Researchers used mass spectrometry to analyze the metabolome and lipidome of serum from adult dengue fever (DF) patients at three different stages of infection: early febrile, defervescence, and convalescent. They found 60 differentially expressed metabolites, most of which were involved in acute inflammatory responses. They also found that sphingomyelins were associated with CD8+ lymphocyte activation during the early febrile period, and plasmalogen phosphatidylethanolamines and lysophosphatidylethanolamines were associated with platelet numbers during defervescence and convalescence. The researchers concluded that the self-limiting nature of DF may be due to early widespread host changes in the metabolome and lipidome.
This article describes a study that aimed to identify and map networks of researchers who are conducting research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) in Germany and their partners abroad. The study used a variety of tools, such as OpenRefine, OpenStreetMaps, Table2Net, Gephi, and data from the SCOPUS database, to analyze co-authorship networks, identify highly productive and innovative researchers, and visualize and analyze network characteristics. The study found that a large proportion of NTD research within Germany was conducted by research institutions located in Germany, and that collaborations with partners on the African continent were relatively scattered. The study also identified researchers who were highly productive and innovative in their research on NTDs. The findings of the study can help inform evidence-driven policy making that addresses the needs of patients with NTDs.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are diseases that affect millions of people worldwide, including in Haiti. In 2000, a strong mass drug administration (MDA) program was launched in Haiti to combat these diseases. The program was led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population and its collaborating international partners. The program reached full national scale by 2012, and by 2012, almost all districts in Haiti had met the epidemiological coverage targets of 65% for LF and 75% for STH. The program was a great success, and Haiti has made significant progress toward the elimination of LF. The program involved several key programmatic elements, including strong community awareness, community trust of drug distributors, direct observation of treatment, easy access to treatment, and quality data collection. The program has been successful in part due to sustained international financial and technical support, especially in the past eight years. The program has not only helped establish the global portfolio of "best practices" for NTD control but also has laid the foundation for ongoing STH control.
Sinorhizobium meliloti is a type of bacteria that can live in the soil by itself or as a partner with legumes to form a mutualistic symbiosis. The symbiosis involves several developmental stages, during which the bacteria must coordinate cell proliferation with the development of host plant cells. CtrA is a protein that helps control the timing of cell division and other processes during the cell cycle. Recent research has shown that CtrA is also important for the symbiotic differentiation of S. meliloti, which includes cell branching and genome amplification. The authors of this paper wanted to learn more about how CtrA regulates the cell cycle in S. meliloti during the symbiosis. They found that the cell cycle of S. meliloti is uncoupled from DNA replication in the symbiotic state, which is different from the cell cycle in the free-living state. They also found that CtrA regulates different processes in S. meliloti during the symbiosis, such as cell branching, and genome amplification, compared to C. crescentus CtrA. The authors believe their findings provide valuable insight into how genetic networks can evolve to fit the diverse lifestyles of different bacteria.
Francisella tularensis is a bacterium that causes the disease tularemia and is highly infectious. It has the ability to multiply and survive inside macrophages, which are types of white blood cells. In this study, the authors used a special method to identify genes that are important for Francisella to survive inside macrophages. They found a gene called FTL_0766 that was important for Francisella to survive inside macrophages. The FTL_0766 gene encodes a protein that helps Francisella to use glutathione (GSH) as a source of cysteine. Cysteine is an important amino acid that Francisella needs to grow and survive. The authors also found that a mutant strain that had a deleted FTL_0766 gene was strongly attenuated for virulence in mice. This means that the mutant strain was much less able to cause disease in mice. The authors concluded that the FTL_0766 gene is important for Francisella to survive inside macrophages and to cause disease in mice.
Leishmania parasites are two species that cause two different types of Leishmaniasis in humans and animals. These parasites can be found inside a sac-like structure within cells called parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs). These PVs can fuse with other PVs that contain different Leishmania species, but not with PVs of other organisms. The ability of parasites to fuse with each other is important for their survival and reproduction. Researchers have found that L. amazonensis amastigotes, which are found in large PVs, can fuse with L. major promastigotes, but not with L. major amastigotes. The PVs that contain L. major promastigotes can fuse with L. amazonensis PVs, but the promastigotes cannot differentiate into amastigotes. These findings suggest that PVs can be customized by different Leishmania species, and that the PV environment can influence the ability of parasites to fuse with each other.
In this study, the authors investigate the ability of native, membrane-expressed JR-FL Env trimers to elicit neutralizing antibodies ( nAbs ) against HIV-1. They find that unusual potent nAb titers developed in 2 out of 8 rabbits immunized with virus-like particles ( VLPs ) expressing trimers and in 1 out of 20 rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost. They also find that 2 out of 3 sera neutralize via quaternary epitopes and exploit natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the second conserved region of JR-FL gp120. These gaps were shared by 2 trimer VLP sera and one of the trimer DNA sera. The authors also find that removing the N197 glycan from the trimer DNA serum (which was proximal to the CD4 binding site) rendered 50% or 16.7% of clade B tier 2 isolates sensitive to the two trimer VLP sera, showing broad neutralization via the surface masked by the N197 glycan. They also find that the neutralizing DNA trimer serum took advantage of the absence of a glycan at residue 230, also proximal to the CD4 binding site. The authors conclude that their data show for the first time that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes. They also suggest that cross-neutralization can occur in the absence of protecting glycan. The authors believe that their findings provide new insights that may inform the future development of a neutralizing antibody vaccine.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin disease that can lead to severe scarring, caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium ulcerans. It affects mainly children and the elderly, and is most common in West Africa. The current treatment for BU involves taking antibiotics for eight weeks, but some patients' wounds take longer to heal. In this study, researchers looked at the proteins found in the skin of patients with BU during the healing process, using a technique called immunohistochemistry. They found that several proteins were useful for understanding how the skin heals after BU treatment, and that some patients' wounds take longer to heal due to issues with wound healing.
Axons can be very long, and mitochondria need to be transported to the right places to meet the metabolic demands of the axon. Scientists have studied how mitochondria move in vitro, but these studies have limitations because they do not have the same structure and physiology as living cells. To solve this problem, scientists used confocal imaging to observe mitochondrial movements in vivo along resting and electrically active mouse nerves. They stimulated myelinated and unmyelinated axons to see how this affected mitochondrial movement. They found that electrical stimulation increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial movement, and that the frequency of the electrical stimulation increased the speed and number of moving mitochondria. Additionally, the scientists found that stationary mitochondria became shorter and that these shorter mitochondria were used to replenish the population of moving mitochondria. The moving mitochondria did not congregate near the nodes of Ranvier, but continued to move along the axon. This suggests that the peripheral terminals of sensory axons are areas of high metabolic demand during electrical activity. The scientists also found that increased mitochondrial movement during electrical activity may be a way to ensure that there is a uniform increase in mitochondrial density along the length of the axon, supporting the increased metabolic demand of sustained conduction. This research provides important information about how mitochondria move in vivo and how electrical activity affects this movement.
The article is about a genetic condition called spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT), which causes progressive vertebral fusions and short stature. The article discusses how the protein Filamin B (FLNB) is important for proper vertebral bone formation. The authors used mice to study the role of FLNB in SCT and found that FLNB helps to maintain the correct shape of the spinal discs. Without FLNB, the spinal discs undergo abnormal cell fate changes and become more similar to bone, leading to fusions and degeneration of the discs. The authors also found that FLNB helps to regulate TGFβ and BMP signaling, which are important for bone formation and growth. These findings provide new insights into the causes of SCT and degenerative disc disease.
The Thogoto virus (THOV) is an orthomyxovirus that infects chickens and causes respiratory disease. Researchers have found that THOV ML, a protein produced by the virus, interacts with a protein called TFIIB, which is involved in the initiation of gene expression. THOV ML causes TFIIB to be localized to the cytoplasm instead of the nucleus, which leads to changes in gene expression. However, not all genes are affected by THOV ML. Instead, the virus specifically targets the expression of type-I interferon genes, which are important for the immune response. The researchers believe that THOV ML impairs expression of these genes by interfering with IRF3, a transcription factor that is involved in the expression of type-I interferon genes. However, THOV ML does not directly interact with IRF3 and instead may be targeting a central transcription factor, such as TFIIB, to indirectly affect IRF3.
Parvovirus B19 (B19V) infects human red blood cell-producing cells, causing cell cycle arrest and DNA damage. This article describes the function of a protein called non-structural protein 1 (NS1) in this process. The authors used two versions of NS1 to study its role in cell cycle arrest. They found that the NS1 protein contains a transactivation domain that is responsible for arresting cells at G2 phase. The authors then analyzed the gene expression changes that occur in response to the NS1 protein to understand how it causes cell cycle arrest. They found that NS1 activates the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) pathway, which is involved in DNA damage repair. The ATR pathway, in turn, phosphorylates CDC25C at serine 216, which inactivates the cyclin B1/CDK1 complex. The authors conclude that the NS1 protein is responsible for arresting cells at G2 phase by activating the ATR pathway and inactivating the cyclin B1/CDK1 complex. This is important because it helps us understand how parvoviruses infect and damage cells, which may lead to new ways of treating these infections.
Dengue is a common mosquito-borne illness that causes a wide range of symptoms. In severe cases, it can lead to vascular leakage, or fluid accumulating in tissues. The virus responsible for dengue, called DENV, produces a protein called NS1 that causes the endothelium, or the layer of cells that line blood vessels, to become more permeable, allowing fluid to leak out. This can be prevented by using medications that target proteins involved in the breakdown of the glycocalyx, a layer of sugars and proteins that covers the surface of endothelial cells.
This research describes the relationship between the septin ring in budding yeast and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) during mitosis. The septin ring is a collar of proteins that forms at the bud neck and helps coordinate cytokinesis. The SPOC ensures that the anaphase spindle is aligned correctly before cytokinesis. The research shows that two redundant ubiquitin ligases, Dma1 and Dma2, are required for the correct assembly and dynamics of the septin ring and for the activation of the SPOC. This is because Dma1 and Dma2 help recruit a kinase called Elm1 to the bud neck, which is necessary for the SPOC to function properly. The research suggests that Dma1 and Dma2 help regulate the position of the spindle by controlling the dynamics of the septin ring, which in turn affects the position of the spindle.
In this study, the authors used genetic data from 61 worldwide populations to identify signals of selection in the human genome that are associated with climate variables. They found that genic and nonsynonymous SNPs were more strongly correlated with climate variables than non-genic SNPs, suggesting that adaptation to climate has shaped the distribution of genetic variation in humans. The authors also found that several of the strongest signals of selection overlapped with those from previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, they found enrichments of strong signals in gene sets related to UV radiation, infection and immunity, and cancer. These results suggest that climate has played a central role in shaping human adaptations, and that many of the genetic signals of selection identified in previous GWAS may be related to adaptations to climate.
The short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by shortened QT intervals and an increased risk of sudden death due to arrhythmias. Researchers have identified the N588K mutation in the hERG potassium channel, which leads to changes in the IhERG current and IKr current. These changes are associated with shortened QT intervals and increased risk of re-entrant arrhythmias. Using mathematical models of ionic channels and cardiac tissue, researchers have been able to simulate the effects of the N588K mutation on ventricular action potentials and tissue excitability. The findings of this study provide a clear link between the molecular changes in the hERG channel and the functional changes in cardiac tissue that contribute to the arrhythmic risk in SQTS.
Collective behavior refers to the behavior of a group of individuals as a whole rather than as individuals. A number of models have been proposed to explain this behavior, but they can either be simple or accurate, but not both. New techniques allow us to individually track each animal in large collectives with high precision, but it is difficult to increase accuracy without increasing complexity. Here we propose a new type of deep neural network, called deep attention networks, that are organized into modules. This modular organization allows us to understand the underlying rules of collective behavior by analyzing the modules. We have tested this model with simulated and experimental trajectories of zebrafish, and we found that it can accurately predict the behavior of the zebrafish and extract important information about the underlying rules of collective behavior.
The emergence of drug-resistant HIV is a serious concern for the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. Around 10% of ART-naive patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV type 1. The fitness cost of major resistance mutations, defined as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug-resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug-sensitive strains, is an important measure for understanding drug resistance dynamics. In this study, we use phylogenetic analysis to reconstruct the transmission tree of HIV strains and model it using stochastic birth–death–sampling processes to quantify the fitness cost of major resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV cohort. We found that the 90M mutation in the protease gene is the only resistance mutation that has significantly higher fitness than the drug-sensitive strains. Among the remaining resistance mutations, only 67N, 70R, 184V, and 219Q had fitness costs that were significantly lower than the drug-sensitive strains. Our study provides a novel approach for estimating the fitness cost of drug resistance mutations using data from a Swiss HIV cohort.
In this study, the authors examined the role of the Elongator complex, a group of proteins that help with transcription, in fission yeast. They found that a protein called Sin3/Elp3, which is part of the Elongator complex, is important for stress survival in fission yeast. The authors determined that Sin3/Elp3 helps with the modification of certain tRNAs, which are responsible for coding amino acids and are important for protein synthesis. They found that a tRNA modification is required for normal survival after stress in cells lacking Sin3/Elp3, and that overexpressing a particular tRNA can complement the stress-related phenotypes of Sin3/Elp3 mutant cells. The authors also found that the lack of a functional Elongator complex results in stress phenotypes due to its contribution to tRNA modification and subsequent translation inefficiency of certain stress-induced, highly expressed mRNAs.
We found that Nef can increase the resistance of HIV-1 virions to neutralization by certain antibodies that target the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) by up to 50-fold. This increase in resistance is not due to changes in the quantity of Env on the virion, but rather to changes in the way that Env is incorporated into the virion. Nef increases resistance to MPER-targeting antibodies such as 2F5 and 4E10, but has no effect on resistance to antibodies that target other regions of Env or that are inhibited by the peptide T20. We found that this activity of Nef is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef. This new function of Nef has important implications for anti-HIV-1 immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
We are studying the way the liver fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini, interacts with its snail intermediate host, Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos, using molecular techniques. We have created a transcriptome of the snail that will help us better understand the relationship between the snail and the parasite. This information may lead to new ways to treat or prevent this type of cancer.
Leprosy is a common and socially stigmatizing infectious disease. It is caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium leprae and M. lepromatosis, which primarily affect the skin and peripheral nervous system. The disease can range from paucibacillary tuberculoid to multibacillary lepromatous disease, depending on the quality of the immune response. Genetic variants of the host and environmental factors influence the immune response. Recent genetic association studies have identified specific polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to leprosy. In this work, we investigate complement receptor 1 (CR1) polymorphisms, mRNA expression levels, and soluble CR1 levels in Brazilian leprosy patients. Our results suggest that CR1 polymorphisms may play a regulatory role in mRNA and sCR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing susceptibility to leprosy.
Metabolomics is a powerful tool used to analyze physiological and disease-induced biological states. It takes into account both an organism's genetic factors and the effects of lifestyle, diet, and environment. Recently, common genetic variants have been found to have a large effect on individual metabolic capacities. These are called "genetically determined metabotypes." Genetic variants in metabolism-related genes lead to specific and differentiated metabolic phenotypes. Genetic studies can help to understand the direction of effects between metabolites and diseases. The combination of genetic and metabolic markers is an important emerging approach for biological research. It is important to minimize the occurring confounders on human serum metabolites in a population-based study.
We developed a new objective function, MiMBl, to improve the capacity of genome-scale metabolic models for predicting genetic interactions. MiMBl captures the biologically important concept of metabolic adjustment and was found to outperform the current objective functions used for predicting genetic interactions in yeast. Using MiMBl, we found a large set of negative genetic interactions involving functionally distant genes, as well as positive interactions between genes that are connected by a short metabolic pathway. These interactions are well-supported by experimental data and suggest that the metabolic network is strongly regulated to maintain metabolic homeostasis.
This study investigates how the topography of the landscape affects the spread of plague, a highly virulent and re-emerging disease, in Madagascar. The study was carried out in four areas that differ in topographic relief and cover about 150–200 km2 within the plague focus of Madagascar. The authors compared plague seroprevalence levels and genetic structure of black rats (Rattus rattus), the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. They found that the seroprevalence levels mimicked those previously reported for humans, and that rat populations had a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differs between areas. This suggests that plague distribution is not related everywhere to the effective dispersal of rats. The authors conclude that the relationship between plague occurrence and landscape characteristics in Madagascar is complex and requires further research to fully understand.
In this study, the authors examine the immunoglobulin response to a family of proteins on the surface of the schistosome worm that causes the parasitic disease schistosomiasis in humans. The authors identify 11 proteins within this family and demonstrate that infected humans mount an immune response to two of these proteins, providing evidence that they are exposed to the surface of the schistosome. These findings may contribute to the development of a vaccine against this parasitic disease.
The study used a computer simulation to understand the shapes of cells in the Drosophila retina, which is made up of many repeating units called ommatidia. Each ommatidium contains many cells, including eight photoreceptor neurons and twelve accessory cells. In the retina, two types of cell-cell adhesion molecules are expressed: E-cadherin and N-cadherin. N-cadherin is only expressed by four cone cells, which are part of the core of the ommatidium. The study found that the shapes of the cells in the retina can be explained by a simple model that minimizes the interfacial energy between cells. The model was able to reproduce the shapes of wild-type and mutant cells, and it emphasized the importance of adhesion protein biogenesis and its timing with respect to cell remodeling. The study also found that N-cadherin protein is recycled from inactive interfaces to active interfaces, which helps to modulate the adhesion strengths between cells.
The protein MT1-MMP is important for the process of cancer cell invasion. It helps to degrade the surrounding matrix which allows the cancer cells to move and spread. It is located at structures called invadopodia, which are specialized membrane protrusions that help cancer cells move through the surrounding matrix. However, the turnover rate of MT1-MMP at invadopodia and its role in ECM degradation were not clear. The authors measured the turnover rate of MT1-MMP using Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments, and found that it was very rapid, with time constants of 26 seconds and 259 seconds. They also built a computational model and found that the rapid turnover of MT1-MMP was crucial for ECM degradation. The authors suggest that their computational model can help design and evaluate intervention strategies for cancer cell invasion.
Scientists have studied how HIV-1 evolves within an individual and spreads spatially. They have found that the virus in the blood is not the same as the virus in other parts of the body. For example, they found that the virus in the vagina is different from the virus in the blood, which suggests that the genital tract forms a different viral population. It is unclear how well the blood plasma represents the broader HIV-1 population. This could lead to incorrectly applied therapies and the selection for further drug resistance. Additionally, previous studies have examined the relationship between viruses from different tissues, but the results are equivocal. The scientists compared viral DNA and RNA from four different compartments (the blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina) of four macaques infected with RT-SHIV, a simian immunodeficiency virus containing HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and treated with monotherapy to induce the emergence of two of the most prevalent drug resistance mutations. They found that the blood and lymph nodes were rarely compartmentalized, while the blood and lymph node were more frequently different from mucosal tissues. This study suggests that even often-sampled blood does not fully capture the viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially the gut.
Tissue growth can be influenced by chemical signals (called "diffusible factors") that can change the probability of stem cells to renew or differentiate. In some tissues, these chemical signals can also control the shape of the tissue and the way it grows. Recent research has shown that some tissues use this mechanism to grow in specific shapes, such as branches or tubes. This can happen in many different tissues, including the lungs, limbs, and intestines.
The article describes a genome-wide association study of myopia in Europeans. The study identified 22 novel genetic associations with myopia, including a strong association with a variant in the LAMB2 gene. The study also replicated a previous association with the GJD2 gene and a novel association with the RASGRF1 gene. The findings suggest several novel genetic pathways in the development of myopia and provide new insights into the complex etiology of myopia.
The current study investigates different forms of feedback from body curvature to a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that controls the movement of a lamprey. Two types of feedback were considered: directional feedback and magnitude feedback. Directional feedback either excites or inhibits the oscillators on the same side of the body, depending on the direction of the curvature. Magnitude feedback excites or inhibits the oscillators on both sides of the body, depending on the magnitude of the curvature. The results show that directional feedback changes the duration of muscle activity, while magnitude feedback changes the frequency of the oscillations. The study highlights the importance of understanding the different forms of feedback that are present in the CPG circuit and how they affect the movement of the lamprey.
The global HIV pandemic is dominated by one group of viruses (group M), and this group has been diversifying since it jumped from chimpanzees to humans about 100 years ago. HIV has been spreading across the world and has been split into several different types or subtypes. Some countries have more than one subtype, which means that there are compartmentalized epidemics where different subtypes infect different risk or ethnic groups. HIV has been spreading slowly between these compartmentalized epidemics, and shifts between subtypes occur only very slowly. Scientists have developed a simple model of HIV epidemics to better understand how different virus strains compete with each other at the population level. They simulated epidemics where the second strain was introduced into a population where the first strain had already established a steady-state epidemic and assessed whether the second strain was able to spread in the population. They found that the second strain spread on a much slower time scale than the initial expansion of the first strain. In order to become dominant over a time scale of decades, the second strain needed a considerable advantage in transmission efficiency over the resident strain. If the second strain was introduced while the first strain was still in its growth phase, it was even harder for the second strain to invade. The scientists also tested how different mechanisms of interference, such as inhibition of superinfection, depletion of highly connected hubs in the network, and one-time acute peak of infectiousness, contribute to the inhibition effect. They found that all of these mechanisms play a role in the competition dynamics of HIV at the population level, which may explain the global phylogeography of the virus and may influence the future evolution of the pandemic.
The organization of muscles is a product of adaptation over different length scales, including the sarcomere and muscle bundles. To better understand how the cytoskeleton organizes with respect to these scales, we developed a computational model and tested it in vitro. We found that myofibrils organize into bundles that are tightly spaced, rather than being irregularly dispersed, and that the alignment of these bundles is dependent on geometric cues in the extracellular matrix. Additionally, we identified two organizational processes that contribute to the polarization of the contractile cytoskeleton: the interaction between actin fibers, premyofibrils, and focal adhesions, as well as cooperative alignment and parallel bundling of nascent myofibrils. Our results suggest that a hierarchy of mechanisms regulate the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton, and that a positive feedback loop is responsible for initiating the break in symmetry that is necessary for polarization.
The paper describes a study on the potential use of Wolbachia, a type of bacteria that infects mosquitoes, as a biocontrol tool to reduce dengue transmission. Wolbachia can invade and spread to infect all individuals within wild mosquito populations at a high rate of maternal transmission, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, and low fitness costs in the host. However, the study found that extensive differences in climate, field-release protocols, urbanization level and human density among the sites where Wolbachia has been deployed have limited comparison and analysis of its invasive potential. To address this issue, the researchers examined the key phenotypic effects of the wMel Wolbachia strain in laboratory Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a Brazilian genetic background to characterize its invasive potential. They also performed mark-release-recapture experiments using Wolbachia-uninfected Brazilian mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future. Through analysis of laboratory, field and mathematical data, the researchers show that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments in Rio de Janeiro. They also developed optimized release strategies for each field site that will greatly benefit the upcoming biocontrol trials and likely prove applicable to field sites in other cities and countries that share similar characteristics.
In this study, the researchers identified a new protein that can remove methyl groups from histones in rice, a type of plant. This protein, called JMJ703, specifically removes methyl groups from histone H3 lysine 4, which is involved in plant growth and stress adaptation. The researchers also analyzed the structure of JMJ703 and identified key residues that are necessary for the protein to function. They found that these key residues are also conserved in other proteins that remove methyl groups from histones. This suggests that JMJ703 and its homologues may be specifically adapted to remove methyl groups from histone H3 lysine 4. The researchers believe that this new understanding of JMJ703's structure and function can help us better understand how plants regulate their growth and stress response.
The article describes a study on the HIV-1 capsid, which plays a key role in all steps of infection. The study reveals that a previously unknown multi-subunit interface within CA hexamers mediates the binding of linear epitopes to cellular cofactors NUP153 and CPSF6, and is competed for by antiretroviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. This interface involves multiple ligands sharing an overlapping binding site in HIV-1 capsid that is lost upon viral disassembly. The study also shows that NUP153 and CPSF6 have overlapping binding sites, but each makes unique interactions with CA. These results provide a molecular basis for the interactions of NUP153, CPSF6, PF74 and BI-2 with HIV-1 capsid, and reveal how these ligands influence infection. The study has important implications for the development of new antiviral therapies that target this interface.
The mosquito Aedes aegypti transmits important human arboviruses such as dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. To understand how these diseases are transmitted in mosquitoes, researchers need to know the organization of their genome. However, the genome of Ae. aegypti is very large and has many repetitive sequences, making it difficult to assemble. To overcome this problem, researchers have used genetic mapping and a new technology called RAD sequencing to improve the genome assembly of Ae. aegypti. This improved genome assembly allowed researchers to assign more scaffolds to chromosomes and order the scaffolds along the chromosomes. Additionally, researchers found large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres. Using the improved genome assembly, researchers were able to map a gene that makes Ae. aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi. This study provides an important resource for researchers to better understand the genetic basis of vector competence in mosquitoes.
This study compares four types of traps that are commonly used to monitor the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which is a disease-carrying mosquito found in tropical areas. The study was conducted in five cities with different climates in Brazil and was designed to investigate how well each trap detects mosquito density variation and how consistently each trap measures mosquito infestation over time. The study found that all four traps performed better than the traditional household larval survey in measuring the seasonal variation in mosquito abundance. The study also found that the four traps were consistent in their ability to detect changes in mosquito infestation over time. The study concludes that all four traps are useful tools for mosquito surveillance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to the traditional household larval survey.
The human protein APOBEC3G (A3G) is a protein that stops the spread of HIV-1 virus. It does this by editing the viral DNA during replication, which causes mutations that make the virus less able to infect new cells. The protein also inhibits the infection process in a way that is not yet fully understood. A3G is incorporated into the HIV-1 virus when it is made, but the virus protein Vif removes it from the virus. By analyzing the crystal structure of a similar protein, researchers have found that certain parts of A3G are important for its ability to inhibit the virus. They also found a pocket in the protein that may be important for its ability to interact with RNA and to be incorporated into viruses. When they changed the amino acids in this pocket, it affected the ability of A3G to inhibit the virus and to interact with RNA.
In this paper, the authors present a detailed analysis of the genomic region of the Drosophila melanogaster "bab" gene that controls the pattern of female abdominal pigmentation. They identified 6,705 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 65 insertion-deletion polymorphisms in the gene and its surrounding regions, and then tested which of these variations were associated with the pigmentation pattern. The authors found that three regions of the gene were significantly associated with the pattern of pigmentation, and that each region contained multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms that contributed to the overall effect of the region. They then used a combination of allele-specific expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays to identify specific regions of the gene that are responsible for regulating its transcription. By combining these different approaches, the authors were able to identify specific regions of the bab gene that are responsible for controlling the pattern of female abdominal pigmentation, and to describe the complex relationship between the gene's DNA sequence and its transcriptional regulation.
The study explores the relationship between two important systems in Streptococcus pneumoniae, the competence system that allows the organism to take up foreign DNA, and the blp locus that encodes pneumocin, a protein that kills other bacteria. The study found that DNA uptake and pneumocin production are regulated by the same quorum sensing system, which is triggered by a peptide pheromone called CSP. This connection between the two systems allows pneumococci to target other bacteria for killing while also taking up foreign DNA, which helps them adapt to changing environmental conditions. The study suggests that this unique connection between DNA uptake and pneumocin production may contribute to the success of S. pneumoniae as a pathogen.
This paper focuses on the role of two proteins, PCBP2 and SRp20, in ribosome recruitment for IRES-dependent translation initiation of poliovirus. The authors demonstrate that SRp20 is localized to the cytoplasm of poliovirus-infected cells and partially co-localizes with PCBP2. In addition, the authors show that both PCBP2 and SRp20 are associated with viral RNA and that SRp20 is associated with PCBP2 bound to viral RNA. Finally, the authors generated a mutated version of SRp20 lacking the RNA recognition domain and found that this protein is also localized to the cytoplasm of poliovirus-infected cells and partially co-localizes with PCBP2. The authors conclude that these findings support the model that SRp20 interacts with PCBP2 on viral RNA to recruit ribosomes for IRES-dependent translation initiation.
The neural crest (NC) is a group of embryonic cells that become a variety of different cells in the body, such as neurons, melanocytes, and smooth muscle cells. The NC starts out in a part of the embryo called the neural tube. As the neural tube develops, some cells in it turn into the NC. Once the NC cells turn into what they will become, they go to different parts of the body. There are many diseases that happen when something goes wrong with the NC, such as skin and hair pigmentation disorders, nervous system disorders, and heart defects. Scientists used a special type of mouse that has a mutation in the NC to find out what genes and proteins are important for NC development. They found four mutations that made the NC look different in these mice. One of these mutations was found to be in a protein called Erbb3. The scientists found that a change in just one amino acid in the protein was enough to make it work differently and cause problems with NC development. This shows that even small changes in proteins can have big effects on the body.
In this study, we investigate why some people are more susceptible to Schistosoma infection than others in a fishing community in Uganda. We found that people's susceptibility to infection is not determined by their ethnicity, but rather by how much they are exposed to cercariae, the larval stage of the parasite. We also found that people's age and sex are not associated with their susceptibility to reinfection, but rather with how much they are exposed to cercariae. However, we found that some people, regardless of their exposure to cercariae, had stronger immune responses to the parasite than others, which could explain why they were less likely to be reinfected. Overall, we found that taking a multidisciplinary approach to studying Schistosoma infection can lead to more robust conclusions and a better understanding of the biology of the disease.
This study examined the relationship between the number of Clonorchis sinensis worms and the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPGs) from human subjects. The researchers recruited 60 participants in a worm collection trial from 2006-2009 in Sancheong-gun, Korea. After administering praziquantel, the participants were purged with cathartics, and adult worms were collected from their feces. The researchers found a positive correlation between the number of EPGs and the number of worms (r=0.681, P<0.001). The recovery rate of worms was higher in individuals with lower EPGs (9.7% in cases of EPGs 1-1000 and 73.7% in those with EPGs over 1000). The researchers also estimated that at least 110 worms are infected in a human body with EPGs around 3000 and that egg productivity of a worm per day is around 4000. Overall, the study suggests that the number of worms is significantly correlated with the number of eggs in human clonorchiasis.
Drug resistance is becoming a major problem in medicine. To combat this problem, researchers are developing new therapeutic strategies, including multi-target therapies that use combinations of drugs. However, identifying the best targets for these therapies can be challenging. In this study, researchers used a technique called genome-wide screens to identify new targets for multi-target therapies. They did this by screening for genetic mutations that make C. glabrata cells, which are resistant to fluconazole, even more sensitive to other drugs. The researchers identified a gene called GCN5 that could be a target for new drugs. They found that deleting or inhibiting the function of this gene caused C. glabrata cells to become more sensitive to fluconazole. They also found that drugs that inhibit GCN5 could be used to treat fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata. This study provides evidence that genome-wide screens can be used to identify new targets for multi-target therapies. It also suggests that GCN5 could be a promising target for new drugs.
Poliovirus (PV) infection causes cellular membrane changes that affect the formation of the replication organelle. The study found that induction and remodeling of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) and membranes prior to or concurrent with genome replication has not been well studied. Using two PV mutants, EG and GG, that exhibit aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor, the study illuminates the pathway of formation of PV-induced membranous structures. For WT PV, changes to the PI4P pool were observed as early as 30 min post-infection, and PI4P remodeling occurred even in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor. Vesicular clusters appeared in the perinuclear region of the cell at 3 h post-infection, but delays in the onset of genome replication observed for EG and GG PVs were similar to the delays in virus-induced remodeling of PI4P pools, consistent with PI4P serving as a marker of the genome-replication organelle. GG PV was unable to convert virus-induced tubules into vesicular clusters, perhaps explaining the nearly 5-log reduction in infectious virus produced by this mutant. The study concludes that PV induces temporally distinct membranous structures (organelles) for genome replication (tubules) and virus assembly (vesicular clusters). The pace of formation, spatiotemporal dynamics, and the efficiency of the replication-to-assembly-organelle conversion may be set by both the rate of P3 polyprotein processing and the capacity for P3 processing to yield 3AB and/or 3CD proteins.
A team of researchers from Argentina and the United States has discovered a new class of non-peptidic, non-covalent compounds that inhibit the protease cruzain, which is found in the parasite that causes Chagas disease. These compounds are effective against both the enzyme and the parasite and have the potential to be developed as drugs. The researchers used a combination of computer modeling and laboratory experiments to identify these compounds. The study provides a promising new approach to the development of drugs for Chagas disease.
Scientists have developed two DNA-based antigen formulations that have been shown to induce strong T-cell and humoral immune responses against yellow fever (YF) in mice. The first formulation encodes the full-length YF envelope protein (YFE), while the second formulation encodes the YF envelope protein fused to the lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal (L/YFE). Both formulations were tested in two different mouse strains, H2b and H2d, and both elicited strong T-cell responses against almost all epitopes generated by the YF 17DD vaccine. The L/YFE formulation performed better overall and also stimulated high titers of anti-YF neutralizing antibodies comparable to the levels elicited by the 17DD vaccine. The L/YFE vaccine also conferred 100% protection against the YF virus in intracerebrally challenged mice. These results indicate that L/YFE DNA is an excellent vaccine candidate and should be considered for further developmental studies.
This paper describes the discovery of a new transcriptional regulator, SlmA, in Vibrio cholerae, the bacteria responsible for cholera. The study found that SlmA regulates the chb operon, which is involved in the uptake and catabolism of the chitin disaccharide chitobiose. The orphan sensor kinase ChiS regulates the chb operon, and the study found that SlmA is downstream of ChiS activation. The study also found that DNA-binding is critical for SlmA to activate transcription of the chb operon, but not nucleoid occlusion. The study suggests that SlmA plays a new role as a transcriptional regulator in V. cholerae, in addition to its established role as a cell division licensing factor.
The paper presents a nonlinear programming (NLP) framework for scalable parameter estimation problems that arise in dynamic modeling of biological systems. This framework is computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. It uses a time discretization approach that avoids repetitive simulations of the dynamic model, enables fully algebraic model implementations and computation of derivatives, and enables the use of computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques. The framework is demonstrated on synthetic human gut microbiome community models and is shown to be scalable, able to solve problems with up to 2,352 parameters and 20,352 data points in less than 15 minutes. The framework is also flexible and can be applied to a wide range of dynamic models.
The study aimed to evaluate the nCounter, a high throughput digital gene expression system, for understanding the inflammatory response of the West Nile virus (WNV) in the Swiss Webster (SW) outbred mouse model. The nCounter Mouse Inflammation gene expression kit containing 179 inflammation related genes was used to analyze gene expression changes in multiple tissues over a nine day course of infection in SW mice following intraperitoneal injection with WNV. Protein expression levels for a subset of these cytokine/chemokine genes were determined using a multiplex protein detection system (BioPlex) and comparisons of protein/RNA expression levels made. The study showed that Cxcl10 and Il12b are differentially expressed in all tissues tested except kidney, while C3ar1 was down-regulated in spleen, Il23a was upregulated in lung, and Il10rb was down-regulated in liver. In WNV infected liver, Stat1, Tlr2, chemokines Cxcl1, Cxcl3, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, cytokines Il6, Il18, cytokine-related gene Il1r, and cytokine agonist Ilrn were significantly upregulated. The study demonstrated that the nCounter platform has utility for rapid identification of gene expression changes in SW mice associated with WNV infection.
In Mozambique, rabies is a big problem. Many people don't report rabies cases or have accurate information about them. In 2014, a rabies outbreak in Maputo and Matola cities prompted researchers to investigate the problem. They looked at 14 cases of human rabies and 819 cases of animal bites in these cities. They found that age, being bitten by a stray or unvaccinated dog, having a deep or head wound, and not using soap and water or getting a vaccine after the bite were risk factors for getting rabies. They also found that only 27% of the unvaccinated dogs had been immunized. The researchers found that rabies control measures in these cities are ineffective, and they suggested ways to improve them. They expect their findings to help formulate recommendations and strategies to control rabies in Mozambique.
In this study, researchers identified a new gene, SCN9A, which is associated with febrile seizures (FS). They found a mutation in this gene, p. N641Y, in a large family with FS. They also found other mutations in the same gene in 5% of unrelated FS patients and 8% of Dravet syndrome patients. The researchers then used targeted homologous recombination to introduce the mutation into mice, and found that the mice had significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures, and increased corneal kindling acquisition rates. These findings suggest that the SCN9A p. N641Y mutation is likely causing the FS in the family. The researchers also found additional mutations in SCN1A, a gene associated with Dravet syndrome, in nine Dravet syndrome patients. These mutations were all in highly conserved amino acids, and six of these patients also had mutations in SCN9A, which further supports the role of these two genes in epilepsy.
The article explores how complex shapes arise in growing tissues and how these shapes may be controlled by genetic and environmental factors. Two main systems for controlling tissue growth are described: the axiality-based system and the polarity-based system. The axiality-based system relies on stresses in the tissue to specify growth orientations, while the polarity-based system relies on local molecular signaling to specify orientations independently of stresses. A new computational framework, called GPT-framework, is developed and applied to a growing Snapdragon flower to illustrate how the polarity-based system can be used to understand and model complex tissue shapes. The article shows how different combinations of growth orientations and rates can lead to a variety of tissue shapes and how these shapes can emerge through the interaction of these combinations within the constraints of a mechanically connected tissue. The article concludes by proposing that the combinatorial interactions between growth orientations and rates have been exploited during evolution to generate a wide range of observed biological shapes.
The study looks at how immune cells called CD8+ T cells affect the evolution of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) during the early stages of infection. When HIV enters a host's body, it causes the immune system to respond, which results in the production of CD8+ T cells that target and kill infected cells. However, the virus can mutate and become resistant to these CD8+ T cells, a process known as escape. The study looked at data from people with HIV and found that some escape mutations appeared later than others, meaning that they had slower escape rates (how quickly they became fixed in the population). This phenomenon is known as escape rate decrease (ERD). The authors propose that interference between different escape mutations could be responsible for the ERD. To test this idea, they developed a mathematical model that takes into account how HIV evolves during infection and how CD8+ T cells respond to it. They then compared the predictions from the model to the data and found that the model with interference was a better fit. The authors also looked at how the number of different escape mutations, the time before the immune response started, and the rate at which HIV mutates could affect the ERD. They found that the ERD was best explained by the way that escape rates decline over time, which is known as underexponential decay. Finally, the authors compared their model with and without interference and found that both models were able to explain the underexponential decay pattern in the data.
The 5-year survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer patients with advanced stages can be as low as 1% . For patients with resectable disease, successful preoperative chemotherapy is essential to eliminate micrometastasis and improve operability . A mechanistic model is used to predict the plausible value range of cell killing efficacy of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens for patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The model incorporates the mechanisms of uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. The methodology is based on tumor volume data before and after or during treatment, and takes into account the effects of tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. The results provide a quantitative framework for estimating the in-vivo cell killing ability of different chemotherapies, which can help in personalized predictions.
A recent study investigated the mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance displayed by biofilm bacteria. Biofilms are communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and have a protective matrix that makes them resistant to antibiotics. In this study, the authors used random transposon mutagenesis to identify biofilm-specific tolerant mutants of Escherichia coli, a model organism for studying biofilms. They found that starved biofilms were significantly more tolerant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics than their planktonic counterparts. The biofilm-associated tolerance to fluoroquinolones was dependent on a functional SOS response upon amino acid and carbon source starvation, but it did not involve any of the SOS-induced toxin–antitoxin systems previously associated with persisters. The biofilm-specific ofloxacin tolerance also increased with biofilm age. These results suggest that nutritional stress is a mechanism linking nutrient deprivation and biofilm-specific tolerance to fluoroquinolones. This knowledge can be used to develop new strategies for treating biofilm infections.
The parasite Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria, a disease that is spread when it invades human red blood cells. The parasite's ability to invade red blood cells is dependent on the secretion of proteins from specific organelles within the parasite. We have found that the protein kinase A (PKA) is activated by the molecule cAMP, which helps regulate the secretion of these proteins from the parasite. This finding could lead to new ways to prevent malaria by targeting these processes.
Strongyloides stercoralis is a type of roundworm that lives in soil and can infect humans. It is one of the most overlooked diseases in the world. It is estimated to be present in many countries but most information about its prevalence is just an educated guess. People who walk barefoot, work in soil or live in poor sanitary conditions are at a higher risk of getting this disease. The disease is usually asymptomatic but can cause hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis in some people. These conditions can be fatal. The disease is difficult to diagnose and is often overlooked. This study is important because it helps to determine the prevalence of S. stercoralis in different countries and in different risk groups. The results of this study can help to create effective strategies to control this disease.
The circadian clock is a complex system that generates rhythms in gene expression and physiology on a daily basis, even when the external environment is kept constant. In mammals, these rhythms are regulated by a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which keeps individual cells in each tissue in sync. However, the same cannot be said for the rhythms within individual cells. A new study shows that changes to stochastic noise can be measured by analyzing the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings from cultured circadian reporter cells. The study demonstrates this method using data from both individual and population-level recordings of fibroblast cells. The results show that stochastic noise affects population-level rhythms, and that this can be reliably measured by analyzing the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings. The study also shows that small molecule modulators can change damping rate in a dose-dependent fashion, and that this can be explained by changes to intrinsic stochastic noise. The results of the study have important implications for the development of small molecule circadian therapeutics. By analyzing the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings, researchers can quickly identify drugs that affect stochastic noise. This can help to identify promising drug candidates for the treatment of various diseases, including metabolic diseases and cancer.
In this study, we analyzed the PC190723-binding pocket in the bacterial cytoskeletal protein FtsZ from different species and in different states. We found that the pocket was different in species and in the nucleotide-binding state of FtsZ. We also found that the PC190723-binding pocket was more similar to polymerized FtsZ in Staphylococcus species than in other species. Our results suggest that PC190723 binds best to polymerized FtsZ of Staphylococcus species.
Lentivirus is a type of virus that can cause diseases such as HIV/AIDS, and it infects and integrates its DNA into the host cell's genome. This integration process is done by an enzyme called integrase (IN) that carries out two separate reactions on the DNA. The first reaction, 3′-processing, takes place in the cytoplasm of the host cell, where a di- or trinucleotide is removed from each viral cDNA end, exposing 3′-hydroxyl groups. The second reaction, strand transfer, occurs in the nucleus of the host cell, where the 3′-hydroxyl groups nick and join to opposing strands of the host DNA. To complete the process, cellular enzymes repair the integration site, resulting in a stable provirus flanked by short duplications of the host DNA sequence. Retroviral INs share a conserved three-domain organization, each containing a central catalytic core domain (CCD), flanked by N- and C-terminal domains (NTD and CTD). The structure of a full-length retroviral IN remains elusive, but a plausible tetramer model for the apoenzyme has been proposed based on a crystal structure of a two-domain fragment of HIV-1 IN containing its NTD and CCD. Lentiviral DNA integration critically depends on a host factor called LEDGF that binds to HIV-1, HIV-2, and other lentiviral INs, stimulates their strand transfer activity, and plays a critical role in directing PICs to active genes during integration. The structure of the LEDGF IBD, composed of a pair of α-helical hairpins, has been determined both separately and in complex with the HIV-1 IN CCD. In the INCCD:LEDGFIBD complex, Ile-365 of LEDGF inserts into a hydrophobic pocket at the IN dimer interface, and the interaction is further bolstered by additional hydrophobic interactions between IN residue Trp-131 and LEDGF Phe-406 and Val-408. Asp-366 of LEDGF plays an important role in protein-protein recognition, forming a pair of essential hydrogen bonds with the main chain amides of IN residues Glu-170 and His-171. Mutation of LEDGF Asp-366 to Asn ablated the interaction with all lentiviral INs tested so far, indicating a common mechanism of recognition. In this work, the authors extend the known lentiviral IN-LEDGF interface to include contacts between the IN NTD and the IBD of LEDGF. This part of the protein-protein interface is essential for high affinity binding and stimulation of concerted DNA integration, and allows designs of complementary pairs of IN and LEDGF mutants for practical uses in gene therapy.
The kinetics of different types of cells within various organs are determined by a set of inherited characteristics that affect their behavior. When these cells become cancerous, these kinetics are preserved and determine how the initial cancerous cell population and tumor grow. These kinetics can be modified by genetic mutations or epigenetic alterations that can increase the fitness of cancerous cells. The study aimed to explore how these changes in kinetics affect the development of intratumoral heterogeneity and the evolutionary trajectories of cancer stem cells. The researchers developed a mathematical model to track the temporal evolution of cancer stem cells, which are the only cells that can initiate and sustain tumors. The study found that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth, with an increase in proliferation potential resulting in a larger population of non-stem cancer cells that compete with cancer stem cells and inhibit their division. A reduction in proliferation potential can loosen this inhibition, allowing for frequent division of cancer stem cells and facilitating tumor growth. The study also found that cancer stem cells themselves become highly heterogeneous over time, with different subpopulations exhibiting different levels of growth. The researchers suggest that the clonal diversity seen in biopsies represents only a small proportion of the total number of phenotypes, highlighting the importance of studying cancer stem cells in order to gain a more complete understanding of tumor growth and progression.
Influenza and other viruses can jump from animals to humans, and sometimes spread from person to person. The authors want to understand how well a virus can spread from person to person when it first jumps from animals to humans. They think that how well the virus can spread depends on how many people travel between communities, how big the communities are, and how well adapted the virus is to human hosts. They also think that the evolutionary biology of the virus is more important than how the people are organized into communities. They study this using simple math models. They found that if there are enough people traveling between communities and if the virus is well adapted to human hosts, then the size of the community has little effect on how well the virus can spread. They also looked at real data on how many people travel between communities, and they found that many communities are well connected. They concluded that evolutionary factors are more important than how the people are organized into communities in deciding how well a virus can spread when it first jumps from animals to humans.
Wild birds may spread influenza viruses to humans and livestock, including highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza. Birds may also transmit influenza viruses between different host populations. However, it is not known how influenza viruses spread between different host populations. In this study, researchers used genetic data to analyze the movement of influenza viruses between North American migratory bird populations over a 34-year period. The results show that wild birds may not play a significant role in spreading influenza viruses between host populations. Instead, influenza viruses may spread independently of bird flyways. This information is important for developing predictive models for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection.
Influenza A viruses have sixteen different subtypes called hemagglutinin (HA). These subtypes are generally defined as serotypes determined by neutralization or hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests using polyclonal antisera to the respective HA subtypes. However, recent studies have shown that the structures of HA antigenic sites vary among not only different subtypes of viruses but also the same subtype. This means that the neutralizing antibodies are not broadly cross-reactive among HA subtypes. In this study, a novel monoclonal antibody (MAb) called MAb S139/1 was generated that reacts with a variety of HA subtypes. This antibody recognizes a common epitope on the globular head region of HA and inhibits virus binding to the sialic acid receptors. The present study suggests the potential of antibodies in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection.
Strongyloides stercoralis is a type of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) that can cause serious medical problems, especially in immunosuppressed people. It is estimated that 30-100 million people worldwide are infected, but due to difficulties with diagnosis, lack of symptoms, and lack of screening, this number may be an underestimate. Strongyloides is a public health challenge that requires action, but there is no general agreement on what measures should be taken. Some people advocate for environmental management to interrupt transmission, but pharmacological treatment is also effective and safe. The use of oral ivermectin is now accepted as the treatment of choice. However, disagreement persists over the need for widespread testing and elimination of the infection. Diagnosis can be challenging, especially in communities where the infection is endemic. ELISA testing is now accepted as sensitive and specific enough for use in clinical and research settings, but there is a need to validate the reference ranges for these tests in high prevalence communities. The current study is a three-year follow-up of a cohort of patients who were tested and treated for strongyloides infection in an Aboriginal community in northern Australia. The study is the first to examine the long-term outcome for adults who were treated and continue to live in an endemic community without any attempt at environmental manipulation. Furthermore, the study aims to validate the use of a lower ELISA threshold for treatment by looking at response to treatment and long-term outcomes in these patients.
Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded form of a protein called prion protein (PrPSc). Different strains of prion diseases are caused by different misfolded forms of PrPSc. Two strains can interfere with each other in a process called strain interference. This interference can affect how the strains emerge from a mixture of strains and how they are transmitted to other animals or humans. A group of scientists studied whether two long-incubation period strains, which have a low conversion efficiency, could interfere with each other. They did this by infecting animals with different combinations of strains and studying the effects on the animals. They also used a special laboratory technique to amplify the prion protein and study its properties. The results showed that the two long-incubation period strains could not interfere with each other in vivo or in vitro. This means that the strains did not affect each other's ability to cause disease in animals or humans. The scientists believe that this lack of interference is due to the low prion conversion efficiency of the strains, which means that they do not form as many prion particles as other strains. Overall, this study changes the way we think about prion strain interference and has important implications for understanding how prion diseases spread.
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are found to be involved in allosteric regulation. However, the mechanism behind how these proteins can implement allosteric effects remains unclear. In this study, the researchers propose a comprehensive ensemble model that takes into account both order-disorder and order-order transitions. They found that the MWC pathway, which involves order-order transitions, has a higher probability of allosteric effect compared to the EAM pathway, which involves order-disorder transitions. Additionally, they derived an analytic formula that reveals that too stable or too unstable states are unfavorable to allostery. This study provides insights into the role of IDPs in allosteric regulation and helps in the rational design of allosteric drugs.
Prostate cancer is a common cause of death in men, but there are not many frequent genetic changes that drive it. The protein β-Catenin plays an important role in development and tumorigenesis, but there are conflicting reports about its role in human prostate cancer. In this study, the researchers used in vivo genetic studies in embryos and adults to better understand β-Catenin's role in the normal and neoplastic prostate. They found that β-Catenin is essential for prostate development and that an inherent property of high levels of this protein in prostate epithelia is to drive squamous differentiation. The researchers also found that β-Catenin overexpression can promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of this disease.
The article discusses the importance of informed consent in ethical research, especially in developing countries where the information sheets and consent forms borrowed from developed countries may not be suitable for research participants. It highlights the difficulties of obtaining informed consent in some communities due to cultural differences, lack of literacy, and the norms of decision-making. The article recommends several ways of overcoming these difficulties, such as preceding individual consent with community-level consultation and approval, using verbal consent, and providing information about the study at the correct level of comprehension. The article also provides practical ways in which these recommendations were applied in a genetic study of podoconiosis in Ethiopia.
Researchers assessed the dynamics of T cell proliferation and migration across different stages of their development in the thymus and spleen of mice. They used a combination of flow cytometry analysis and mathematical modeling to quantify and interpret the data. They found that genetic background and aging affect the dynamics of T cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. The findings of this study can help us better understand the mechanisms that regulate T cell dynamics and the role of aging and genetics in immune function.
Scientists have created the first mouse model of mitochondrial tRNA disease by introducing a mutation into the mt-Ti gene, which encodes a mitochondrial tRNA. This mutation causes a mitochondrial disease in humans that affects the brain and nervous system. The mutation affects the tRNA's ability to properly fold, which impairs its ability to be charged with the correct amino acid, isoleucine. The cells with the mutated mt-Ti gene showed an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis in response to increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. This compensatory response partially restored the mitochondrial function and led to a milder mitochondrial disease phenotype. This study suggests that the compensatory response to mitochondrial tRNA mutations is not limited to humans, but can also occur in mouse models. This finding could have important implications for the treatment and prevention of mitochondrial diseases.
In mammals, both males and females have two X chromosomes. To balance the expression of X-linked and autosomal genes, the X chromosome in females is inactivated and expression levels are doubled in males. In human triploid cells (with three sets of chromosomes instead of two), X chromosome expression levels are higher than in normal cells, but this expression does not strictly respond to an autosomal factor. Instead, it is adjusted to balance the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which may be done by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the number of active X chromosomes relative to the number of autosomes. The X chromosome in female triploid cells with one active X chromosome is expressed at a higher level than in normal cells. This suggests that the X chromosome is adjusted to balance the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes. In triploid cells with two active X chromosomes, X chromosome expression is doubled, as expected. In general, X chromosome expression levels are adjusted to balance the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes in triploid cells, but this may vary depending on the number of active X chromosomes.
The ratio of the number of non-synonymous substitutions to the number of synonymous substitutions, known as dN/dS, is often used to measure the effects of evolutionary pressures on proteins. However, the dN/dS ratio can be misleading when applied to samples from a single population because it does not take into account segregating polymorphisms, which are differences among sequences within a population. As a result, the dN/dS ratio can be relatively insensitive to selection pressures. Moreover, the hallmark signature of positive selection, dN/dS>1, is violated within a population. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples.
Scientists have been studying how natural selection shapes patterns of genetic variation across the genomes of different species. Previous studies have found that neutral genetic variation within species (differences caused by random genetic drift and mutation) is reduced at sites linked to those under direct selection. However, the effect of linked selection on neutral sequence divergence (differences between species) remains unclear. In this study, the authors examined whether natural selection can affect divergence between both closely and distantly related species. They found that neutral divergence between closely related species (such as human-primate) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with human recombination rate. They also found that neutral divergence between distantly related species (such as human-rodent) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. The authors suggest that these patterns are caused by natural selection affecting linked neutral divergence through background selection in the ancestral population. These findings have implications for understanding the evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.
The CK2 kinase is involved in the regulation of circadian clocks in different organisms. In the Drosophila circadian oscillator, CK2 phosphorylates and destabilizes the CLK activator, while reducing its activity. These effects counteract the action of CK1, which promotes CLK degradation. CK2α, but not CK2β, regulates CLK stability and activity. Dominant-negative CK2αTik increases CLK stability and hyperphosphorylation, resulting in increased CLK activity. These findings define CK2 as the first bona fide kinase of Drosophila CLK involved in its degradation and hyperphosphorylation.
Chagas disease is a disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and spread by blood-sucking insects called Reduviidae. The parasite needs to attach to the gut of the insect in order to infect the insect's host and spread to other hosts. In this study, researchers investigated whether a type of enzyme called cruzipain is involved in the attachment of the parasite to the insect's gut. The researchers treated the parasites with anti-cruzipain antibodies or a panel of cysteine peptidase inhibitors and then measured the ability of the parasites to attach to the insect's gut. They also compared the attachment rate of parasites with high or low levels of cruzipain. The results showed that all treatments, with the exception of CA074-OMe, significantly decreased the ability of the parasites to attach to the insect's gut. The researchers also found that transgenic parasites with low levels of cruzipain attached much less to the insect's gut than wild-type parasites. These findings suggest that cruzipain is involved in the attachment of the parasite to the insect's gut.
In this study, the authors describe their discovery of twenty "suppressor genes" that are able to correct for the lethality caused by a mutation in the dynein heavy chain gene dhc-1. Dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor protein that is involved in a variety of important cellular processes, including mitosis and organelle positioning. The authors used a combination of genetic screening and biochemical analysis to identify these suppressor genes, which are required for these processes to occur normally. The authors suggest that the suppressor proteins may be involved in the regulation of dynein function, and that they may play a role in other cellular processes beyond mitosis.
Researchers in the field of genetics have discovered that during the development of a unicellular organism called Paramecium tetraurelia, certain regions of DNA called "Internal Eliminated Sequences" (IES) are cut out and removed. This is a unique process that takes place during the formation of a new nucleus from a copy of the existing one. The researchers found that a protein called Ku is required for this process to happen. They discovered that Ku is involved in the process of cutting the DNA, and that it works with a protein called PiggyMac to do this. The researchers concluded that Ku is an important part of the process of removing IES during the development of a new nucleus in Paramecium tetraurelia.
Prion diseases are long-term illnesses that cause the brain to degenerate and can eventually result in death. Neurons are cells in the brain that send and receive signals and are affected by prion disease. These neurons change their gene expression, which affects how they function, during the early stages of prion disease. Some of these gene expression changes can be reversed during the later stages of prion disease. These changes can affect how neurons communicate and how they survive. Manipulating these changes may help in treating prion disease.
In this paper, we present a novel model of visceral leishmaniasis using a stochastic Petri net approach. Our model reproduces many of the experimental observations made in mice infected with Leishmania donovani, including the initial expansion of parasites, the role of various leukocyte populations in controlling the infection, and the effect of cytokines on the outcome of the disease. Our model suggests that the effector function of granulomas is regulated by the balance of different types of leukocytes, and that autocrine IL-10 production by infected macrophages is a key regulator of this balance. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms of granuloma formation and function, and may help in the development of new therapeutic approaches to visceral leishmaniasis.
This study investigates the computational capacity of genes in transcriptional regulatory networks. The authors show that different parameterizations of a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation are capable of approximating all four standard arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—as well as various equality and inequality operations. The authors also demonstrate how this model can be used to create networks that approximate more complicated functions, such as the square root, by allowing for multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and suggest new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes joint pain, fever, and rash in humans. It has three different genotypes: West African, East/Central/South African, and Asian/Caribbean. The Asian/Caribbean genotype is more likely to spread to humans and is responsible for multiple outbreaks. The East/Central/South African genotype has spread from Africa to North and South America and is now cocirculating with the Asian/Caribbean genotype in Brazil. This is the first study to report the cocirculation of both genotypes in the same region.
Bacteria acquire genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT), which can increase genetic diversity and help bacteria colonize new environments. However, incorporating foreign DNA can disrupt the regulation of the core genome and result in a fitness cost. The H-NS protein helps bacteria control the expression of foreign DNA. In some cases, H-NS requires the help of proteins from the Hha/YmoA family. In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, the H-NS protein binds preferentially to AT-rich HGT DNA, but it also controls the expression of core genome DNA. In this study, we found that plasmid-encoded H-NS proteins evolved to discriminate against HGT DNA, while chromosomally-encoded H-NS proteins target both HGT and core genome DNA. We also found that chromosomally-encoded H-NS proteins use Hha-like proteins to selectively silence HGT genes. These findings suggest that in enteric bacteria, the H-NS modulator evolved to distinguish between vertically and horizontally inherited DNA sequences and specifically silence HGT genes. This feature could provide a fitness advantage by allowing the presence of a large number of silent virulence genes without interfering with the regulation of the core genome.
Life cycle studies of Leishmania parasites are of great importance for understanding their pathogenesis and finding new therapeutic targets. In this study, gene expression profiles of L. major, L. infantum and L. braziliensis amastigotes were analyzed by microarray. The results revealed that only a small number of genes are differentially expressed between the three species. Moreover, very few of these genes are modulated during the parasite life cycle. The findings suggest that parasites have developed adaptations to survive within the host regardless of the immune pressure and that these adaptations may be conserved between different species of Leishmania.
The parasitic worm Amphimerus spp. has been recently identified as endemic in Ecuador, causing a disease called amphimeriasis that affects both humans and animals. Amphimerus spp. can be diagnosed through a wet mount technique of examining feces, but this is time consuming and can be inaccurate. Molecular methods have been developed to detect Amphimerus spp., including a new method called LAMP (Loop-mediated isothermal amplification). This new method has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity, and could be used in developing countries for the diagnosis of amphimeriasis in field conditions.
In this study, the authors found that Syntaxin17 (Syx17), a protein involved in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, requires the help of another protein called Ykt6. The authors discovered that Ykt6 forms a complex with Syx17 and Snap29 to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that Ykt6 is required for autophagosome clearance in Drosophila larval fat cells. They also found that Ykt6 and Vamp7 are both required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion and are mutually exclusive subunits in a Syx17-Snap29 complex. This suggests that Vamp7 is directly involved in membrane fusion and Ykt6 acts as a non-conventional, regulatory SNARE in this process.
Scientists have found a way that bacteria defend against a type of molecules that are naturally made by our bodies and that fight bacteria. These molecules, called antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), can harm bacteria by destroying their outer membranes and leaking out their contents. Some bacteria, such as the one that causes pneumonia (NTHI), have adapted to protect themselves from AMPs. NTHI can use a system that is similar to a "pump" to move AMPs out of the bacteria and keep them from being harmed. The scientists have now found that the pump that NTHI uses to fight off AMPs is actually doing something different. It is actually bringing AMPs into the bacteria and then making them harmless. This is a new way for bacteria to protect themselves from AMPs and it is important to know about it because it can help scientists find new ways to fight off bacteria that cause infections.
In this study, the authors explore how the half-life of the transcription factor MarA affects the coordination of its downstream targets. MarA is a key regulator in E. coli that controls a variety of stress response genes. The authors find that the half-life of MarA plays a crucial role in both the rate and maximum coordination that downstream genes can achieve. They achieve this by modifying the half-life of MarA through genetic engineering or by using a CRISPRi-mediated knockdown of the protease that targets it. The authors find that active degradation can impact both the rate of coordination and the maximum coordination that downstream genes can achieve. In the context of multi-gene regulation, the authors show that there is a trade-off between perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination. This study provides insights into how the half-life of regulatory proteins affects their functionality and coordination with other genes.
Leishmania is a type of parasite that is spread through infected sandfly bites and can cause a wide range of diseases in humans, including cutaneous lesions and systemic diseases. The body's immune response is important for controlling the infection, and this can be divided into two main types: TH1 and TH2. TH1 is characterized by the production of IFN-γ and TNF-α by CD4+ T cells, which in turn causes macrophages to produce nitric oxide, killing the intracellular parasites. TH2 is characterized by the production of IL-4 by CD4+ T cells, which helps the parasites to survive and grow. MKP-2 is a protein that is involved in the regulation of immune responses. Previous studies have shown that MKP-2−/− mice are more susceptible to a different type of Leishmania infection, but they were not studied for their susceptibility to L. major infection. In this study, the authors found that MKP-2−/− mice had a similar response to L. major infection as wild-type mice, with no significant change in the TH1/TH2 balance. They also found that MKP-2−/− macrophages were more permissive to L. major infection than wild-type macrophages, but they were equally effective at controlling parasite growth when classically activated.
The mammalian pancreas is made up of three main components: acinar cells, ductal cells, and endocrine cells. The pancreas forms a branched network, with the ductal system being the main focus of this study. The development of the ductal network is poorly understood, and the authors of this study are looking to quantify the network properties at different developmental stages. They found that the pancreatic network exhibits stereotypic traits at each stage and that the network properties change with time toward the most economical and optimized delivery of exocrine products into the duodenum. The authors used in silico modeling to show how the steps of pancreatic network development can be deconstructed into two simple rules. The early stage of the network is explained by noisy, redundant duct formation as new microlumens form, and the later transition is attributed to pruning of the network based on the flux of fluid running through the pancreatic network into the duodenum. Overall, the study provides a new conceptualization of pancreatic ductal development and highlights the importance of quantifying and modeling networks to understand their development and function.
In this study, the authors use computational methods, specifically accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations, to investigate the dynamics of the motor domain of kinesin, a key protein involved in microtubule-based transportation in cells. They focus on two major conformations of the motor domain, ATP-like and ADP-like, which are observed in crystallographic structures. The authors use aMD simulations to investigate the dynamics of these conformations and to identify the key residues involved in the conformational transition from ADP-like to ATP-like. They also investigate the dynamics of the neck-linker, which is important for microtubule binding, and how it is coupled to the dynamics of the motor domain. Overall, this study provides new insights into the dynamics of kinesin and its role in microtubule-based transportation.
The Lux system is a type of gene expression reporter that can be used to measure gene expression in bacteria and eukaryotes. It is fast, sensitive and non-destructive, which makes it possible to conduct high-frequency measurements. However, interpreting the bioluminescent data is difficult because the light output is not directly proportional to gene expression due to complex molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. In this paper, the authors present a new computational approach that allows users of Lux assays to infer gene transcription levels from the light output. They developed a mathematical model that takes into account the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC, and Fre, as well as the synthesis and turnover of Lux proteins. The model was calibrated with new experimental data for LuxAB and Fre reactions, while literature data was used for LuxEC. The authors show that the predicted bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output, which are similar to light output seen in some experimental data sets. By incorporating the calibrated model into a Bayesian inference scheme, they were able to reverse engineer promoter activity from the bioluminescence. They provide examples where a decrease in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a switching off of the promoter or an increase in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a longer period of gene expression. This approach could benefit all users of Lux technology.
This study presents the crystal structure of coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) in complex with a molecule called GPP3, which inhibits the replication of enterovirus 71 and CVA16. The study used in silico docking to investigate the interactions of GPP3 and two next-generation capsid binders, NLD and ALD, with CVA16. The results of the study suggest that these molecules have similar binding modes and are potent inhibitors of a wide range of enteroviruses. The study also provides a deeper insight into the structural features required for capsid binders to interact effectively and those that confer broad-spectrum anti-enterovirus activity.
The study was conducted to understand the immune response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections in Drosophila melanogaster. The study found that a serpin-family inhibitor called Necrotic is responsible for controlling the proteolytic cascade that activates the innate immune response to fungal and Gram+ bacterial infections. It was found that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph by two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. The study used a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation to "freeze" endocytosis in these cells and found that Necrotic is taken up in two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. The study also found that Necrotic uptake responds rapidly to infection, being visibly increased after 30 minutes and peaking at 6-8 hours. The study used co-localization of anti-Nec with anti-AP50, Rab5, and Rab7 antibodies to establish that Necrotic is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localizes with the ubiquitin-binding protein, HRS. It was found that Necrotic does not co-localize with Rab11, indicating that the serpin is not re-exported from athrocytes. Instead, mutations that block late endosome/lysosome fusion cause accumulation of Necrotic-positive endosomes, even in the absence of infection. The study also found that LDLR1 enhances the immune response, and that uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LDLR1.
In this study, we explore the role of BMP signaling in left-right (LR) axis establishment in sea urchins. BMP signaling is known to be important for LR patterning in other animals, but its role in sea urchins was unknown. We found that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch (CP) of the sea urchin embryo and that this is important for the development of left-sided structures. We also found that Nodal signaling on the right side inhibits BMP signaling and controls LR asymmetry. Our findings suggest that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved across different animal models.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common virus that can cause serious illness in weakened individuals, such as organ transplant recipients and newborns. When infected, HCMV starts to replicate and produce viral proteins, but this process can be paused if the host cell is not in the right stage of the cell cycle. This pause is called "latency" and HCMV can remain in this state for a long time without causing harm to the host. However, if the host cell is in the right stage of the cell cycle, HCMV can reactivate and begin to replicate again, causing damage to the host cell. Scientists have found that infections that occur when host cells are not in the right stage of the cell cycle are still able to reactivate if the activity of specific proteins in the host cell is inhibited. This suggests that the ability of HCMV to remain in a paused, or latent, state may be linked to the host cell's cell cycle and the specific proteins that are active in that stage.
Elite controllers have the ability to fight off HIV-1 infections without the use of drugs. They do this by producing highly-effective HIV-1-specific T cell responses. Scientists are trying to figure out why these immune responses happen in some people, but not in most. They think that dendritic cells (DCs) may be playing a role. DCs are a type of immune cell that is very good at presenting antigens to T cells and keeping them activated. In this study, scientists showed that when DCs from elite controllers were exposed to HIV-1, they produced more type I interferons (IFNs) and upregulated many IFN-stimulated genes that help fight off viruses. This was different from DCs from people who were not elite controllers, who did not produce as many type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes when exposed to HIV-1. The scientists think that this difference in DC responses may be because elite controllers have more HIV-1 reverse transcripts (which are early viral replication products) that can be sensed by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS. This leads to more type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes being produced, which can help fight off HIV-1. They also found that improved cell-intrinsic immune recognition of HIV-1 in DCs from elite controllers helped them stimulate and expand HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses more effectively. Overall, this study suggests that DCs may play an important role in helping elite controllers fight off HIV-1 infections, and that type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes may be key to this process.
Obesity is a complex condition and can be influenced by both genetics and environmental factors. Researchers are using invertebrates like flies to identify genes that regulate the amount of fat stored in the body. By studying these genes, researchers hope to better understand the biological mechanisms of obesity and develop new treatments. In this study, researchers used a genetic screen in flies to identify 66 genes that when mutated, increased fat levels in the organism. Among these genes, the researchers studied Sir2, a sirtuin family member, which is a protein that regulates the storage and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids by deacetylating key regulatory proteins. The researchers found that knocking down Sir2 in the fat body of flies resulted in increased fat levels. The researchers also showed that Sir2 restricted fat accumulation in individual cells of the fat body in a cell-autonomous manner. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that Sir2 mutant larvae survived better than wild type under conditions of amino-acid starvation as long as sugars were provided. This finding suggests that Sir2 plays a role in energy homeostasis in flies. The researchers suggest that further studies of Sir2 in flies and other organisms may lead to a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of obesity.
The paper describes a study that investigated the process of asymmetric cell division in 42 different species of nematodes. The authors recorded the first embryonic division of each species using a microscope and compared the resulting spindle movements to those in Caenorhabditis elegans, a commonly studied species of nematode. They found that, although all species underwent an asymmetric cell division, there were significant differences in the spindle movements of different species. The authors also found that these differences were not related to the size of the embryos and that spindle movements changed frequently during evolution. Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolution of asymmetric cell division in nematodes.
The researcher is studying how the gene network of a bacteria called Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) has evolved to help it survive in different environments, including inside a host's body. The researcher is particularly interested in a specific protein called OmpR, which helps the bacteria respond to different environments. They found that the OmpR protein has a different DNA target in S. Typhimurium than in a related bacteria called Escherichia coli (E. coli), even though the OmpR protein is identical in the two bacteria. The researcher also found that the OmpR protein binds better to DNA that has been relaxed, which is a change that happens in S. Typhimurium under acid stress. This change in DNA structure allows the OmpR protein to regulate different genes in S. Typhimurium than in E. coli. The researcher concludes that the OmpR protein is an important factor in how the gene network of S. Typhimurium has evolved to allow it to survive in different environments.
Chlamydia is a bacterial infection that affects both animals and humans. Chlamydia trachomatis, the most common strain, causes sexually transmitted diseases. C. trachomatis' genome contains a protein that has a SET domain and functions as a histone methyltransferase. The SET domain protein, named NUE (Nuclear Effector), is secreted from bacteria and can methylate histones and itself. NUE is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of C. trachomatis.
This paper is about how the genetic factors that determine human height work. Previous studies have found that about 80% of the variation in human height is determined by genetic factors, with many common variants found through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) . However, there has been little attention given to the potential role of recessive genetic effects. In this study, the authors analyzed inbreeding depression on adult height in over 35,000 people from 21 different population samples. They found a highly significant inverse association between height and genome-wide homozygosity (i.e. the proportion of an individual's genome that comes from both of their parents), with a height reduction of up to 3 cm in the offspring of first cousins compared with the offspring of unrelated individuals. However, there was significant heterogeneity among population samples, meaning that whether or not an effect could be observed depended on both the variance in homozygosity in the population and the chance inheritance of individual recessive genotypes. These results suggest that multiple, rare, recessive variants influence human height. The study provides insights into the genetic mechanisms influencing height, which may also offer insights into genetic variants influencing growth and development and complex diseases. The authors suggest that this study provides a new approach to identifying the missing heritability of quantitative traits and predicting phenotype from genotype.
The study aimed to investigate the changes in the phenotypes and functions of monocytes (MO) during malaria infection and their association with anti-parasitic activity. The authors analyzed the phenotype of MO from healthy malaria-exposed individuals and malaria patients using flow cytometry and an in vitro antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) assay. The results showed that certain MO subsets in patients had higher anti-parasite activity than others, which was associated with lower parasitemia levels. These findings suggest that distinct MO subpopulations are induced during malaria infection and are associated with anti-parasitic activity.
The paper describes a study looking at the relationship between schistosomiasis (infection with parasitic worms) and HIV susceptibility. The study found that schistosomiasis infection was associated with an increased frequency of highly susceptible CD4 T cell subsets (such as Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells) in the blood. However, these immune differences were not observed in the foreskin. The authors suggest that schistosomiasis may increase HIV susceptibility in the genital mucosa, which could contribute to the high HIV prevalence in fishing communities.
The parasite worms that cause diseases such as elephantiasis and river blindness have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria. These bacteria, called Wolbachia, help the worms grow and reproduce. But if you give the worms a special kind of antibiotic, it kills off the bacteria, which makes the worms stop growing, stop having babies, and eventually die. Scientists have been using this to create new treatments for these diseases, but they don't know why killing the bacteria causes these problems. In this study, researchers used special microscopes to look at what happens to the worms when they are treated with this antibiotic. They found that the worms' cells start to die shortly after the bacteria are killed. These cells include germ cells, which make babies, and embryonic cells, which become the new worms. The researchers also found that cells that were not infected with bacteria still died. The bacteria live in a special part of the worm's body called the lateral chords. The bacteria help keep this part of the body together, but the worms still die even though the bacteria are gone. The researchers think that the worms may be dying because their bodies can't function properly without the bacteria, or because the bacteria are sending out a special chemical signal to tell the worms to die. The researchers hope that this information will help them find better treatments for these diseases.
A recent study has identified a new class of anti-malarial drug candidates that target a specific metabolic pathway in the malaria-causing parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. The pathway involves converting pantothenate into coenzyme A, which is a key molecule for various metabolic processes in the parasite. The study used a combination of genetic analysis, whole-genome sequencing, and functional analysis to identify a putative gene that codes for a pantothenate kinase (Pfpank1) that is essential for the parasite's growth in the blood stage. The study also identified mutations in the gene that confer resistance to pantothenate analogues and provide genetic evidence for the importance of the metabolic activation of these compounds in their anti-malarial activity. Overall, the study highlights the potential of targeting the parasite's metabolic pathways for the development of new anti-malarial drugs.
The PR interval on an electrocardiogram (ECG) indicates the time it takes for the heart to prepare and fire an electrical signal, which then travels from the atria to the ventricles. Researchers have found that the PR interval is heritable and can provide important information about arrhythmia risk. However, there has been limited research on the genetic factors associated with PR interval in people of African ancestry. To address this gap in knowledge, the researchers performed a genome-wide association (GWA) study in African Americans from four cohorts. They found a strong signal associated with PR interval duration in the gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel, SCN5A. This signal explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans and was also associated with PR interval in individuals of European ancestry. The researchers also found genome-wide significant associations with SCN10A, MEIS1, and TBX5, which had been previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples. The study highlights the relevance of common genetic variants in African Americans and identifies associations that are more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.
This article is about a study done by researchers to learn more about how positive-strand RNA viruses, like tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), replicate their genomes. Positive-strand RNA viruses have single-stranded RNA genomes that are translated into proteins after they enter a host cell. These viral proteins then recruit the viral genomic RNA to the cell membrane and use it as a template to synthesize complementary negative-strand RNA, which is then used as a template to synthesize new positive-strand RNA. This study found that a small GTP-binding protein called ARL8 and a host protein called TOM1 are both necessary for efficient ToMV multiplication. They also found that ARL8 and TOM1 are components of ToMV RNA replication complexes and play crucial roles in a process toward activation of the replication proteins' RNA synthesizing and capping functions. This study provides important information about the mechanisms of positive-strand RNA virus multiplication that could be used to develop new treatments for viral infections.
In the brain, inhibitory neurons play an important role in shaping the behavior of other neurons by limiting their firing. There are two common types of inhibitory circuits: feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB). In the FF circuit, an excitatory neuron excites another inhibitory neuron, which then inhibits a third group of excitatory neurons. In the FB circuit, an excitatory neuron excites an inhibitory neuron, which in turn inhibits the same excitatory neurons. Both types of circuits can limit the firing of the post-synaptic neurons, but they have different properties. FF inhibition can completely block the firing of post-synaptic excitatory neurons and set the stage for precise temporal processing. FB inhibition is well-suited to synchronize firing in populations of excitatory principal neurons. In the olfactory pathway of both honeybees and mammals, both types of inhibition exist. In the fly and locust, there is evidence for FB inhibition in the mushroom body (MB), which plays an important role in memory and learning. Previous studies suggested the existence of FF inhibition onto Kenyon cells (KCs) in the MB, which are inhibited by LHIs that receive excitatory input from projection neurons (PNs) of the antennal lobe. However, more recent results refute the existence of FF inhibition in the MB and suggest that the main or sole source of inhibition is FB. The GGN is the inhibitory cell responsible for this FB inhibition. FB inhibition creates longer windows for coincidence detection but cannot entirely suppress the firing of excitatory population. Our study reveals important differences between FF and FB inhibitory motifs on circuit dynamics. By comparing the timing of cell firing, we provide a way to probe the connectivity structures of unexplored biological circuits.
Rabies is a fatal viral infection that is primarily transmitted through animal bites and scratches. The virus is found in bats and carnivores, and dogs are the most common reservoir for human infection. The traditional method for diagnosing rabies is based on the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) of brain tissue collected after the animal dies. However, there are now several molecular techniques that can detect the virus in live animals, which can be useful for intra-vitam diagnosis.
A study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of insecticide-treated mosquito fences in controlling tsetse flies that spread trypanosomiasis in Ghana. The study found that the fences reduced tsetse fly populations by more than 95% in just six months, significantly reducing the risk of trypanosome infections in pigs. The study highlights the potential of using insecticide-treated mosquito fences as a cost-effective and sustainable solution for controlling tsetse flies and reducing the spread of trypanosomiasis in rural areas. The use of ITN can be a useful tool for protecting valuable livestock, such as pigs, and increasing food security and income for resource-poor farmers in tsetse-infested regions.
There is a growing movement in science to improve reproducibility and transparency in research. This means sharing detailed plans, raw data, and sources of funding, as well as conducting replication studies and systematic reviews. A recent study looked at 441 biomedical journal articles published between 2000 and 2014, and found that very few of them followed these practices. Few studies shared their detailed plans, raw data was rarely made available, and replication studies were extremely rare. Only 16 studies had their data included in a systematic review or meta-analysis. Funding and conflicts of interest were also not well reported. The study found that articles published in clinical medicine categories were less likely to report funding sources and more likely to have private funding. This study provides a baseline for future research to measure improvements in reproducibility and transparency in science.
Yersinia pestis is a very dangerous bacteria that can be spread through respiratory droplets and causes a deadly infection called pneumonic plague. In mice, this infection has two phases: pre-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory. The pre-inflammatory phase allows the bacteria to grow quickly without any immune response from the host, and the pro-inflammatory phase is marked by inflammation and severe tissue damage. This study shows that Yersinia pestis targets alveolar macrophages early in the infection and switches to neutrophils later. The neutrophil influx is not able to control the bacteria and leads to the severe inflammation during the pro-inflammatory phase. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of the infection and may help in developing new treatments.
The current study aimed to evaluate the performance of serological tests to identify asymptomatic visceral leishmaniasis infection in participants from a cohort study with a two-year follow-up period. Blood samples were collected from 136 participants in an urban area in the Southeast of Brazil in 2001, and they were clinically evaluated. No one had progressed to disease from their asymptomatic state. Two molecular biology techniques (reference tests) were performed: PCR with Leishmania-generic primer followed by hybridization using L . infantum probe, and PCR with specific primer to L . donovani complex. Plasma samples were tested by ELISA using three different antigens: L . infantum and L . amazonensis crude antigens, and rK39 recombinant protein. The accuracy of the serological tests was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, and ROC curve. The presence of Leishmania was confirmed by molecular techniques in all kala-azar patients and in 117 (86%) of the 136 cohort participants. The results showed that the rK39 recombinant protein had a higher specificity than L . amazonensis and L . infantum antigens, but the latter had a higher sensitivity than the former. There was low agreement among the different antigens used. The serological tests were inaccurate for diagnosing asymptomatic infections compared to molecular methods, which could lead to misclassification bias in population studies. Therefore, studies that have used serological assays to estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention programs, or identify risk factors for Leishmania infection may have had their results compromised.
Repetitive elements account for around forty percent of mammalian genomes, with simple repeats and satellite sequences being the most basic. More complex classes of repetitive elements include DNA transposons and retrotransposons. DNA transposons catalyze a non-replicative mobilization of the DNA transposon through a cut and paste mechanism, while retrotransposons mobilize using a replicative copy and paste mechanism that involves an RNA intermediate. Retrotransposons are active in the mouse genome and are recognized and regulated by host defence mechanisms. These mechanisms include transcriptional repression, DNA methylation, histone methylation and histone deacetylation. To determine which retrotransposons are being targeted by these silencing mechanisms, researchers used microarray gene expression data to identify retrotransposons that are silenced in mouse embryonic stem cells (ES). They also identified the histone deacetylase Hdac1 as a regulator of retrotransposons in mouse ES. This study shows that different silencing mechanisms can be independently recruited to retrotransposons in a modular manner and that different genomic copies of individual retrotransposons can be differentially sensitive to loss of these silencing mechanisms. Analyzing the sequence variation between differentially regulated copies of individual retrotransposons can also help identify sequences important for retrotransposon silencing.
The paper describes the function of a group of proteins called CIBs in the process of flowering in plants. These proteins interact with other proteins called cryptochromes and help regulate the amount of light that a plant needs to grow and flower. The study showed that these proteins work together to regulate the timing of flowering in response to changes in light. It also found that these proteins are regulated by light and are involved in the blue light signal transduction pathway.
The article provides an economic evaluation of different options for addressing intestinal parasites that are commonly found in refugees from certain countries when they arrive in the United States. These parasites can cause serious health problems, but are not common in the US. The options include: 1) no intervention, 2) domestic screening and treatment of the parasites, 3) overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and ivermectin, and 4) overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and domestic screening for strongyloidiasis. The study used a model to predict the cost and health outcomes of each option, based on data from previous studies and new data. The study found that overseas presumptive treatment is the most effective option, reducing the number of outpatient cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by around 80%. It also found that overseas presumptive treatment is less expensive than the domestic screening and treatment option.
This paper describes the discovery of a new microsporidian parasite, Nematocida displodere, that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The parasite is unique in that it has a tissue tropism that is different from the other known species of microsporidia in C. elegans. N. displodere invades multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine. However, the majority of replication occurs in the muscle and epidermis, with little replication in the intestine. N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus. The parasite has over 10% of its genes belong to a species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function. This new system provides a convenient model to study the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of tissue tropism using closely related but distinct pathogens infecting the same host.
This article describes a study of a protein called Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) that is important for the repair of damaged DNA in cells. The CSB protein was discovered in the 1990s as one of the proteins that can complement a deficiency of the complementation group B (CGB) gene in fruit flies. Since then, CSB has been found to be involved in various important cellular processes, including transcription, DNA repair, and chromatin remodeling. The study of this article aims to shed more light on the role of CSB in transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR). TCR is a process that involves repairing DNA damage that occurs while a cell is transcribing a gene. It is important because if DNA damage is not repaired during transcription, it can cause the cell to produce faulty proteins that could lead to genetic disorders and cancer. The article describes how the CSB protein interacts with other proteins, including a group of proteins called NAP1-like histone chaperones, to repair damaged DNA during transcription. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of TCR and its importance in maintaining the health of our cells.
The study aimed to create a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome by identifying areas with high inter-individual variation. The authors found that these variably methylated regions (VMRs) occur at enhancers and 3’ UTRs and are enriched for specific transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways of functional relevance to each tissue. The study also found that VMR networks are responsive to the environment, with methylation levels at these loci changing in a coordinated fashion in trans dependent on cellular growth. The authors provide a detailed map of common epigenetic variation in the human genome, showing that both genetic and environmental causes underlie this variation.
Dengue is a serious disease that affects millions of people around the world. There is currently no cure for dengue and treatment is limited to supportive care. Diagnosis is often difficult and time-consuming due to the limited window of detection for viral antigens and antibodies. However, new tests have been developed that can detect NS1 antigen and anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG antibodies, which can improve the sensitivity and speed of diagnosis. These tests were evaluated in a retrospective study in Vietnam and Malaysia and found to be effective in combination with each other.
We want to investigate if evolutionarily related RNA genes fold in a similar way in vivo. To this end, we have developed a new computational method, Transat, which detects conserved helices of high statistical significance. We introduce the method, present a comprehensive performance evaluation and show that Transat is able to predict the structural features of known reference structures, including pseudo-knotted ones as well as those of known alternative structural configurations. Furthermore, we show that the structural features predicted by Transat differ from those assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. Unlike the existing methods for predicting folding pathways, our method works in a comparative way. This has the disadvantage of not being able to predict features as function of time, but has the considerable advantage of highlighting conserved features and of not requiring a detailed knowledge of the cellular environment.
The plant immune system protects plants from potential harmful microbes. However, microbes can target and disable immune system proteins, which can make the system vulnerable. To understand how the plant immune system functions when it is under attack, researchers have created a network of immune system components and have rebuilt it step by step using a network reconstitution strategy. They have found that many of the regulatory mechanisms that control plant immune responses are not detectable by the traditional genetic approach of studying single-gene null mutants. Instead, they have found that many immune system components are buffered by other immune system components, meaning that if one component is removed, other components can take over its function. This buffering helps the plant immune system to function even when under attack. The researchers have also found that the interactions among different parts of the immune system network are very important for its function.
The central nervous system develops from monolayered neuroepithelial sheets, which are then patterned by signaling pathways that control cell fate and diversity in a precise spatial and temporal manner. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster develops its visual system from an optic placode in the ectoderm, which is patterned into two domains by the signaling molecules Hedgehog and Notch. One domain is specified to give rise to the larval eye primordium, consisting of two types of photoreceptor precursors, primary and secondary, and the optic lobe primordium, which develops into the optic ganglia. In a first step, the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Atonal (Ato) specifies larval eye precursors, while the orphan nuclear receptor Tailless (Tll) is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. In a second step, Notch signaling controls a binary cell fate decision to define photoreceptor subtype identity, thus, acts at the top of a cascade of transcription factor interactions to define PR subtype identity. The model serves as an example of how combinatorial action of cell extrinsic and cell intrinsic factors control neural tissue patterning.
In this study, the researchers aimed to investigate the antimicrobial mechanisms of hBD1, a ubiquitously expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide in humans. They used electron microscopy to examine the effects of reduced and oxidized forms of hBD1 on the membranes of bacterial cells. The researchers found that the reduced form of hBD1 forms a net-like structure around the bacteria, which captures and inhibits bacterial transmigration, while the oxidized form of hBD1 does not have this effect. The presence of these nets could completely prevent the migration of hBD1-resistant pathogens and are stable in the presence of human duodenal secretion with a high amount of proteases. The researchers conclude that hBD1-derived nets provide an additional host protection mechanism, which differs from net formation by other defensins and is redox-dependent. This study provides new insights into the antimicrobial mechanisms of hBD1 and its role in innate immunity.
The study found that OCRL1 is required for efficient endocytosis in vivo. OCRL1 is a protein that has been linked to Lowe syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. The study used a zebrafish model to study the effects of mutations in the OCRL1 gene. The results showed that OCRL1 is involved in the proper functioning of the renal tubules, and that endocytosis is impaired in the zebrafish model. The study suggests that defects in endocytosis may be responsible for the renal tubulopathy seen in Lowe syndrome.
Rift Valley Fever (RFV) is a serious virus that can affect both humans and livestock. It is usually transmitted by mosquitoes during outbreaks, which occur in cycles. However, there is evidence that the virus can also be spread during inter-epidemic periods. This study aimed to determine if RVF was being transmitted in an area where annual floods occur. To do this, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in Tanzania among livestock. Blood samples were taken from cattle, sheep, and goats and tested for the presence of antibodies to the RVF virus. Interviews with herd owners were also conducted to gather information about animal characteristics and environmental factors. An overall seroprevalence of 11.3% was recorded, with 22.7% of animals having been exposed during the previous outbreak. There were also significant differences in seroprevalence between females and males. Animals living further away from the flood plain had a higher prevalence of seropositivity. The findings of this study suggest that RVF is being transmitted in the study area and that the animals are likely being exposed to the virus on a regular basis.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of the contractile vacuole complex (CVC) in the trafficking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane of Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc), an obligate intracellular parasite. The CVC is an intracellular compartment that plays a role in osmoregulation, in which it takes up water and expels it out of the cell through pores in the plasma membrane. GPI-anchored proteins, such as trans-sialidase (TS), mucins, and trypomastigote small surface antigen (TSSA II), were found to co-localize with the CVC during transformation of intracellular amastigotes into trypomastigotes and metacyclogenesis. A dominant-negative mutant of TcRab11, which localized to the cytosol, was found to be less responsive to hyposmotic and hyperosmotic stress, and parasites expressing this mutant were still able to differentiate into metacyclic forms and infect host cells. However, they were less infective as compared to wild type cells. When incubated in the presence of exogenous recombinant active TcTS and a sialic acid donor, before infecting host cells, the mutants were partially rescued. These results suggest that TcRab11 plays a role in osmoregulation and trafficking of TcTS to the plasma membrane, and that TcTS plays a role in promoting infection. The authors propose a novel unconventional mechanism of GPI-anchored protein secretion.
The study tested the effectiveness and safety of a new way to give a rabies vaccine called intradermal vaccination (ID) in a shortened regimen compared to the current recommendation. The shortened regimen involved 4 doses given on days 0, 3, 7, and 28, while the current recommendation involves 4 doses given on days 0, 3, 7, and 28 with an extra dose given on day 14. The study found that the immune response and safety of the shortened regimen were not inferior to the current recommendation.
The human brain is a complex system that supports a wide range of adaptive goal-relevant behaviors. The salience network (SN) plays a crucial role in this process by detecting and attending to salient goal-relevant events and facilitating access to appropriate cognitive resources. The SN is anchored in the anterior insula and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. We used large multisession fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project and applied novel graph-theoretical techniques to investigate the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the SN. We found that the large-scale brain dynamics of the SN are characterized by several distinctive and robust properties, including the highest levels of flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other brain networks, the most spatially varied time-varying connectivity profiles of any brain network, consistently high network centrality over time, and distinct temporal flexibility from all other prefrontal control systems. We also found that temporal flexibility of the SN uniquely predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. We concluded that the distinct dynamic functional architecture of the SN is crucial for supporting a wide range of cognitive processes in the human brain.
The last step in a virus's life cycle is its release from the host cell. This is done differently for enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. Enveloped viruses, such as those that cause the common cold, are released from the host cell through budding or membrane fission, which leaves them with a lipid coat. Nonenveloped viruses, such as those that cause hepatitis A and SV40, are released from the host cell through lysis, or the bursting of the host cell membrane. This can lead to the death of the host cell. However, this process is not well understood. In the case of SV40, a newly discovered protein called VP4 appears to be involved in the lysis of the host cell. Researchers have found that VP4 can bind and disrupt lipid membranes, supporting the idea that it plays a role in viral release.
The article is about a DNA vaccine that protects mice from dengue fever. The vaccine is made by combining a protein found in the blood of people with dengue fever (NS1) with a signal peptide from a human protein called tissue plasminogen activator. When mice are given this vaccine, they develop antibodies and T cells that help fight off dengue fever. The article also talks about how these immune responses work together to protect the mice from dengue fever. This information is important for developing a vaccine to protect humans from dengue fever.
In this article, the authors describe the structure and function of a new member of a family of transcription factors that control important processes in Gram-positive bacteria called RNPP regulators. These regulators are activated by extracellular signaling peptides, which can be detected by the bacteria either indirectly or directly. The authors focus on a regulator called ComR, which is involved in competence for natural transformation in streptococci. They study the crystal structure of ComR and its interactions with a signaling peptide called XIP. They find that XIP binds to the TPR domain of ComR, releasing a sequestered HTH domain and causing ComR to dimerize. This allows ComR to bind to DNA and activate transcription of genes involved in competence. The authors also show that this mechanism is conserved among ComR orthologues. This research suggests that targeting the ComRS system could be a useful strategy for controlling gene exchanges and virulence in streptococci.
In this study, we investigated ELIC, a newly discovered type of receptor for neurotransmitters, and its functional properties. ELIC is a member of a large family of neurotransmitter receptors, which are important in transmitting signals in the brain. ELIC is activated by a class of primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA, at high micro- to millimolar concentrations. The ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time. ELIC is a simple and attractive model system to study the general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors. The authors conclude that the study of ELIC provides insight into the architecture and function of this family of neurotransmitter receptors.
Asthma is a common allergic lung disease that often affects people who have eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD), a skin condition characterized by itchy, inflamed skin. The link between AD and asthma is known as the "atopic march," which refers to the progression from AD to asthma. However, the exact mechanism behind this progression is unclear. In this study, the researchers used mice to investigate the relationship between AD and asthma. They found that, like humans with AD, mice with skin-barrier defects developed AD-like skin inflammation and were susceptible to allergic asthma. They also found that a protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), which is overexpressed by skin keratinocytes in mice with skin-barrier defects, was the systemic driver of the allergic asthma. This protein is known to be involved in allergic inflammation and asthma in humans as well. The researchers concluded that TSLP may be an important therapeutic target for preventing asthma in people with AD.
In this study, researchers developed a method that uses multiple types of omics data and bioinformatics tools to analyze and annotate various genomic features. They applied this method to the genome of Thermotoga maritima, a deep-branching, hyperthermophilic bacterium. The analysis revealed unique properties of the T. maritima genome, including a high number of genes per transcription unit, a paucity of non-coding RNAs, few transcription units with multiple transcription start sites, and increased sequence conservation of promoters and ribosome binding sites. These findings suggest that these features may be adaptations to the hyperthermophilic lifestyle of T. maritima.
This paper examines how contextual inputs affect visual object recognition and sensitivity to image features. Human observers were presented with a brief stimulus consisting of a target bar of a known orientation and shape, surrounded by a context of other bars. The study found that weak contextual bars bias observers to perceive a target, while strong contextual bars suppress the perception of a target. The study also found that the context influences the perception in two ways: (1) biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and (2) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The study used a Bayesian model to account for the data and found that the context does not influence the perceived target contrast despite its influence on the bias to perceive the target's presence. The study suggests that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for the visual inferences.
Cooperation is a phenomenon observed in many species, but it is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors who can enjoy the benefits of cooperation without contributing fairly. This can lead to the depletion of the common good and population collapse. However, small population size increases the variability in cooperator frequency across different locations, which can actually favor cooperation in a structured population. During defector-induced population collapse, defectors occasionally go extinct before cooperators, allowing cooperators to grow. Additionally, empty locations created by defector-induced population extinction can favor cooperation because they allow cooperator but not defector migrants to grow. This can sometimes allow defectors to lead to conditions that rescue cooperation from destruction. Resource limitation inducible by defectors can also select for mutations adaptive to resource limitation. When these mutations are initially present at low levels or continuously generated at a moderate rate, they can further reduce local population size and promote cooperation. In summary, defectors can provide a "built-in" mechanism that can rescue cooperation.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a type of bacteria that can cause infections in people with weakened immune systems, burns, and mechanical ventilation. P. aeruginosa is able to survive and spread on mucosal surfaces, but it is not able to do so in healthy epithelial cells. However, when epithelial cells die, they release apoptotic bodies, which are taken up by surrounding epithelial cells. P. aeruginosa is able to infect and survive in these apoptotic bodies, and it is then eliminated from the body within 24 hours.
The Drosophila embryo's gonad is made up of two different cell types: the Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and the Somatic Gonadal Precursor cells (SGPs). The PGCs start at the back of the embryo and are later carried inside the embryo by the SGPs. The SGPs send out signals that attract the PGCs. The researchers have found that the hedgehog signaling pathway plays a key role in this process. The gene shifted (shf) has been shown to play an important role in the migration of PGCs. shf is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm, and experiments have shown that it is required for PGC migration. Additionally, the researchers have found that shf is involved in the production of the PGC attractant, which is produced by both the SGPs and other tissues when hmgcr is ectopically expressed. Furthermore, the researchers have found that hmgcr is involved in the release of the Hedgehog ligand from cells into the ECM, which allows the Hedgehog signal to reach the migrating PGCs. Finally, the researchers have found that cholesterol modification is important for hmgcr to function properly.
Researchers looked at the immune responses of people who had received a vaccine made from a virus that could not cause AIDS. They wanted to find out how good the immune responses were and if they were different from people who had AIDS. They found that the vaccine did cause an immune response, but it was not as strong as the one in people with AIDS. They also found that people with certain genetic markers had a stronger immune response than others.
Scientists have found that the ability of humans to participate in jointly intentional behavior (the ability to work together to achieve a common goal) may have been crucial in the development of human cognitive abilities. The ability to participate in jointly intentional behavior may have been selected against in environments where there was little opportunity for significant technological advancement. Conversely, this ability may have been selected for in environments where there were opportunities for rapid technological advancement. The study suggests that the development of culture, the ability to share intentions, and the ability to reason about shared intentions may have all been interconnected and may have been important in the evolution of human society.
The study explores the role of microRNAs in spermatogenesis, a process that creates sperm. Spermatogenesis has three phases, including mitosis, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. While transcription occurs during meiosis and spermiogenesis, much of the regulation of gene expression happens through post-transcriptional mechanisms. The study found that the miR-34 family of microRNAs is highly expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells. The study suggests that miR-34 may regulate the expression of genes involved in spermatogenesis, which could be important for sperm production and fertility.
This article is about the probiotic properties of a strain of Escherichia coli called Nissle 1917 (EcN). EcN has been used therapeutically for over a century but how it works is still not well understood. The authors of this study looked at two siderophore-microcins (Mcc) produced by EcN that are responsible for its antagonistic activity against other types of bacteria. They also found that EcN produces a genotoxin called colibactin, which is a virulence factor and a potential carcinogen. The authors used mutants of EcN to decouple the antagonistic activity from the genotoxic activity. They found that the antibacterial activity of EcN is linked to the production of siderophores, microcins, and analgesic lipopeptides. The authors conclude that the probiotic properties of EcN are related to its pathogenicity island and that it might have co-evolved to be both pathogenic and probiotic. They also emphasize the importance of understanding how EcN works and taking its safety and potential side effects into account.
Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus that causes a serious respiratory infection that often progresses to a deadly meningoencephalitis in people with weakened immune systems. Glycans are critical for the normal development, growth, and viability of all organisms. C. neoformans has an extensive glycoconjugate repertoire, which helps the fungus survive and cause disease. Glycans include polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids, which all play integral structural and regulatory roles to facilitate fungal survival and pathogenesis. C. neoformans glycans are synthesized in two different compartments of the cell and rely on specialized proteins called nucleotide sugar transporters to move the sugar building blocks across the membrane. We have identified two new nucleotide sugar transporters that are required for the survival and virulence of C. neoformans. These transporters transport a unique sugar donor called UDP-xylose, which is an important component of the cryptococcal capsule. Without these transporters, the fungus cannot make the capsule, which is essential for its survival and ability to cause disease in animals.
In this study, the authors describe the development of an open-access database for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The authors searched for prevalence data of NTDs, including schistosomiasis in Africa, from peer-reviewed journals and 'grey literature', and obtained data from Ministries of Health and research institutions. They extracted and georeferenced the data, and stored them in a MySQL database with a web interface. The database is currently expanded to include other NTDs such as soil-transmitted helminthiasis and leishmaniasis. This database offers unique opportunities for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, disease monitoring, and surveillance, and allows for detailed geostatistical analyses of disease distribution in space and time. The authors demonstrate the proof-of-concept that the establishment and running of a global NTD database is feasible and should be expanded without delay.
Tuberculosis (TB) and worm infections are common worldwide. It is important to understand how they affect each other because they can have negative or positive effects on each other. Currently, there is a lot of debate about how worm infections affect TB infections. Previous studies used mice as a model, but they do not develop the same type of granulomas as humans. However, a new model called the cotton rat model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) has been developed. This model is like the human model because it shows the development of granulomas. This study used this cotton rat model to investigate how worm infections affect TB infections. Two months after TB infection, splenocyte proliferation and interferon gamma production in response to purified protein derivative were assessed. Surprisingly, MTB loads and occurrence and size of lung granulomas were not increased in co-infected animals. This means that worm infections do not make TB infections worse in the cotton rat model. However, this does not mean that worm infections do not make TB infections worse in humans. It is important to note that this study used a specific type of worm called Litomosoides sigmodontis. More studies are needed to understand the effects of different types of worm infections on TB infections in humans.
Insects have different types of ion channels that help them detect and respond to chemicals in their environment. However, most of the functions of these ion channels are unknown. In this study, the authors looked at the role of one specific ion channel, called pickpocket23 (ppk23), in insect behavior. They found that ppk23 is expressed in a specific type of sensory neuron that is important for male-female courtship behavior, not for feeding. They also found that blocking or mutating the ppk23 gene affects the male courtship behavior and the response to a female-specific pheromone. These results suggest that ppk23 plays an important role in the peripheral sensory system that controls sexual behavior in flies.
The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a unique ability to import certain types of cytosolic tRNAs into mitochondria. These imported tRNAs are used to make proteins within mitochondria. However, the regulation of this process is still not well understood. The authors of this study found that the number of imported tRNAs is related to the number of Glycine codons in the mitochondrial genome. They then modified the number of Glycine codons in the mitochondrial genome by replacing some of the existing codons with different ones that encode the same amino acid. This resulted in reduced levels of mitochondrial translation and respiratory complexes, indicating that the regulation of tRNA import is not dynamic but rather fixed. The authors suggest that the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs are determined by the information encoded in the mitochondrial genome.
Diabetes is a serious problem affecting millions of people worldwide. It can be difficult to detect early and diagnose correctly because the current methods used to measure blood glucose levels are not always accurate enough. This study uses a new approach to measure the frequency and type of glucose elevations in individuals with diabetes, prediabetes, and even normoglycemia. It also looks at the factors that contribute to these elevations, such as insulin resistance and secretion. The study found that individuals who were considered normoglycemic using current methods actually had high levels of glucose variability, with some reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges. This highlights the need for more accurate and comprehensive ways to measure glucose regulation. The study also developed a model for identifying specific patterns of glucose regulation in individuals and created a webtool that allows users to upload their own CGM data and classify their individualized glucose patterns. This new approach could help improve the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and prediabetes.
The article is about how a protein called EDR1 controls a type of protein called MAPK. The MAPK protein cascade is important for plants to defend themselves against pathogens. EDR1 is a type of MAPKKK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase) that helps turn off MAPK activity. The article explains that EDR1 interacts with a type of MAPK called MKK4/MKK5 and turns it off, which helps to control how plants defend themselves against pathogens. The article also explains that some types of pathogens can turn on the MKK4/MKK5 MAPK cascade, and this can cause plants to have cell death. The article shows that plants that are missing EDR1 have stronger cell death and are able to defend themselves better against pathogens. The article also explains that EDR1 can turn on the MKK4/MKK5 MAPK cascade, and this can cause cell death in plants.

Infectious diseases are one of the main global health issues, leading to millions of deaths annually. In order to develop effective control and prevention strategies, researchers need reliable computational tools to understand disease dynamics and predict future cases. This study developed a new computational framework based on Gaussian processes to perform spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases. The framework was tested on the problem of modeling Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever cases between years 2004 and 2015 in Turkey. The results showed that the proposed Gaussian process formulation obtained better results than two frequently used standard machine learning algorithms. This framework has the potential to make an important contribution to public health policy makers.
The paper investigates the transmission and dispersal of Rift Valley Fever virus (RFVV) in northeastern Africa using a mathematical model. The model takes into account the spatiotemporal movement of ruminants and mosquitoes, as well as seasonal climate variations, such as rainfall and temperature. The study finds that human activities, such as the annual Eid al Adha festival, along with climate factors contribute to the spread of the disease. The authors propose that the increase in animal transportation and the peak of mosquito abundance coinciding with the festival are key drivers of the disease outbreak. The study provides valuable insights into the spread of RVFV and highlights the need for effective control strategies to mitigate the impact of the disease.
The article focuses on the history of human anthrax in Azerbaijan. The authors used data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human anthrax incidence from 1984 through 2010 to analyze the spatio-temporal distribution of anthrax. The findings suggest that the incidence of human anthrax has declined from 1995 to 2010, with an annual percent change of +11.95% from 1984 to 1995 and a declining rate of -35.24% after the initiation of preemptive livestock vaccination in 1996. The authors also discovered that cases of human anthrax were primarily concentrated in the western part of the country early in the study period, but shifted eastward over time. The article highlights the need for continued control measures in livestock to reduce the occurrence of human anthrax, and the importance of an integrated "One Health" approach for managing zoonotic diseases like anthrax.
In this study, researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to determine how polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) interact with the Shaker KV channel in open and closed states. They found that PUFAs bind to a putative site located in the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the VSD. The lipophilic tail of the PUFA covered a wide range of non-specific hydrophobic interactions, while the carboxylic head group formed more specific electrostatic interactions with the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices. The researchers also studied the interactions between saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and the Shaker KV channel and found that the increased conformational flexibility of the polyunsaturated carbon tails of PUFAs compared to SFAs may explain their specificity for KV channels. These findings may help researchers understand the mechanism of PUFA-channel interactions and design pharmaceutical compounds for the treatment of refractory epilepsy.
This study focuses on Cryptosporidium parvum, a protozoan parasite that causes significant disease burden among children in developing countries and can result in chronic and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. The article describes a pipeline of tools developed to accelerate the in vivo screening of inhibitors of C. parvum IMPDH, including the genetic engineering of the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii to serve as a model of C. parvum infection. The article also describes the development of fluorescence-based assays of host cell proliferation and a C. parvum growth assay that utilizes automated high-content imaging analysis for enhanced throughput. These assays are used to evaluate C. parvum IMPDH inhibitors and to identify a subset of 1, 2, 3-triazole ethers that exhibit excellent in vivo selectivity and improved anti-cryptosporidial activity.
The study aimed to identify the genes that are responsible for the variation in the development of teeth in humans. The study analyzed the genetic makeup of 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort and 1,518 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children for associations with time to first tooth eruption and number of teeth by one year of age. The study identified five loci that were significantly associated with the development of teeth and five with suggestive association. These loci included several genes with links to tooth and other organ development, including KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, and MSRB3. Four of the genes identified in the study have been implicated in cancer. A variant within the HOXB gene cluster was associated with occlusion defects that required orthodontic treatment by age 31.
The article is about a study that aimed to understand the relationship between the trisomy of a specific region of chromosome 21 and the development of DS and M21. To do this, they created two new mouse models that were either trisomic or monosomic for the region of interest. The study found that the trisomic mice had impaired locomotion, increased grip strength, and muscle mass. In contrast, the monosomic mice had opposite results. The study also found that the transcription profile of skeletal muscles in the trisomic mice showed a shift in muscle metabolism, which was confirmed by an increase in oxidative capacity and mitochondrial content of skeletal muscles. The study identified new candidate genes involved in DS and M21.
G protein-gated K+ channels (GIRK; Kir3) are important regulators of heartbeat and neuronal excitability and plasticity. Both neurotransmitter-evoked (Ievoked) and neurotransmitter-independent basal (Ibasal) GIRK activities are physiologically important, but the mechanisms of Ibasal and its relation to Ievoked are unclear. In this study, we have shown that Ibasal and Ievoked of native GIRK in hippocampal neurons are interrelated: the extent of activation by neurotransmitter (activation index, Ra) is inversely related to Ibasal. To understand this relationship, we developed a quantitative model of GIRK1/2 function. Our model accurately recapitulates Ibasal and Ievoked of GIRK1/2 in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, and hippocampal neurons; predicts the dose-dependent activation of GIRK1/2 by coexpressed Gβγ and accounts for the inverse Ibasal-Ra correlation. Modeling suggests that there are 3-4 Gβγ and 2 Gα available for each GIRK1/2 channel. The unequal and variable stoichiometry of GIRK1/2 and its associated Gα and Gβγ explains the inverse Ra-Ibasal relation. Overall, this study shows that the inverse Ra-Ibasal relation is regulated by the availability of Gαi/o, with Gβγ being more abundant in the membrane than Gαi/o. This finding has important implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of GIRK1/2 to both Gβγ and Gαi/o, and for designing drugs that target GIRKs.
We present PrediTALE, a computational tool that predicts target genes of plant pathogenic Xanthomonas TALEs based on their RVD sequence. PrediTALE uses a machine learning approach that incorporates previously collected quantitative data about TALE target specificities. We evaluated PrediTALE using RNA-seq data and compare it with previously available tools. PrediTALE outperforms existing tools and provides more accurate predictions of TALEs target genes.
Scientists have developed a new machine learning algorithm, called APOGEE, to predict the harmfulness of human mitochondrial DNA mutations. The algorithm is designed to accurately classify mitochondrial mutations as harmful or harmless. It uses data from third-party predictors, which analyze the effects of mutations based on various factors such as protein conservation and structural information. APOGEE has been trained on a large dataset of mitochondrial mutations and can classify mutations with high accuracy, making it a valuable tool for predicting the harmfulness of mitochondrial DNA mutations.
The dengue virus causes a wide range of diseases from a mild flu-like fever to a severe form that can be life-threatening. Thrombocytopenia is a common feature observed in both mild and severe dengue disease, and it is strongly correlated with disease severity. However, it is still unclear which viral component causes thrombocytopenia during infection. In this study, researchers have demonstrated that dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can directly induce platelet activation and cause thrombocytopenia during DENV infection. The researchers have also demonstrated that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during dengue infection.
The article investigates how different hormones regulate blood pressure, blood volume, and mean arterial pressure. These hormones are the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The authors found that both systems have the same goal: they affect blood pressure by regulating either vasoconstriction or blood volume. They also discovered that the ANP and AVP systems are candidate oscillators because they have a negative feedback loop that can lead to oscillatory instability. Additionally, the authors found that a subsystem composed of ANP and AVP stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells has a higher oscillatory potential when the delays along all feedback loops are comparable. This is because the negative feedback loops in this system are multiple, and the delays in each loop affect the stability of the system.
The authors of the paper are studying the movement of proteins, specifically thrombin and Fab IgG, through fibrin networks that form during blood clotting. They used Dynamic Light Scattering to measure the size of the protein molecules in solution. They also measured the size of the fibers in the fibrin network using confocal images and calculated the average fiber radius. By using the Stokes-Einstein relation, the authors found that the diffusion coefficient of thrombin and Fab IgG in solution is about 1102.6/s and 400.9/s, respectively. The authors then measured the diffusion coefficients of the proteins in the fibrin network using Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). The authors used Ogston's extended model to fit the data and found that the diffusion coefficient of thrombin is about 280.8/s and the diffusion coefficient of Fab IgG is about 126.1/s in the fibrin network. The authors also used the Johnson model to fit the data, but found that it overestimated the protein diffusion in the fibrin network. The authors then built a hemodynamics model to study the effect of the fibrin network on thrombin transport. They found that the presence of a fibrin network reduces the advection and diffusion of thrombin in the network, and that the fibrin network forms a barrier to the transport of thrombin to the thrombus surface. The authors suggest that the fibrin network provides a mechanism to limit the continued growth of small thrombi.
Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are part of the immune system and help fight infections. These cells have been found to have antimicrobial functions against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. However, the mechanism by which iNKT cells suppress bacterial growth is not well understood. In this study, the authors investigated how iNKT cells suppress intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) replication during infection. When co-cultured with infected macrophages, iNKT cells showed an upregulation of activation markers and produced Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) which is a cytokine known to have antimicrobial activity. However, the authors discovered that this activation was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18, which are cytokines known to be important in the immune response to infection. The authors also found that the ability of iNKT cells to suppress Mtb growth was dependent on the CD1d molecule, which is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like molecule. The authors discovered that a soluble factor, GM-CSF, was necessary and sufficient to control Mtb growth. GM-CSF is a cytokine that is involved in the immune response to infection and is known to have antimicrobial functions. The authors concluded that GM-CSF is an antimycobacterial effector molecule produced by iNKT cells that has the ability to suppress Mtb infection.
The study aimed to better understand how Candida albicans, a fungus commonly found in the human gut and mouth, interacts with its host. The study looked at genes expressed by C. albicans when grown in the gut or mouth of mice, and found that a gene called EFH1 is important for determining the size of C. albicans populations during colonization. The study also found that another gene, RBT1, is important for virulence but not for colonization. These findings suggest that different genes are important for different aspects of C. albicans' interactions with its host.
Malaria is a disease that causes fevers, chills, and flu-like symptoms. There are currently no vaccines available that can protect against malaria, but one effective vaccination strategy is using irradiated sporozoites. Scientists are trying to understand why this strategy is effective, but there is no clear answer yet. In this study, they used TCR transgenic cells specific for a malaria protein to show that sporozoite antigen persists for over 8 weeks after immunization. They found that antigen persistence enhances the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response in a number of ways, including reducing the time primed CD8+ T cells were exposed to antigen in vivo, stimulating the proliferation of established memory cells, and recruiting naïve cells. This study suggests that prolonged antigen presentation is required for the full development of CD8+ T cell mediated protective immunity against malaria.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites and transmitted by sandflies. It can cause skin ulcers that can lead to disfigurement or disability. Current treatments have significant side effects, require hospitalization, and can be resisted by the parasite. To overcome these limitations, scientists are exploring new ways to deliver drugs. Nanoparticles are a promising approach, as they can increase drug accumulation and residence time inside cells. In this study, researchers created nanoparticles called PBCAnps and tested their ability to deliver an antibacterial drug called polB. PolB has activity against bacteria that cause secondary infections in leishmaniasis ulcers. The researchers tested PBCAnps loaded with polB in vitro and found that they had leishmanicidal and antibacterial properties. The nanoparticles slowed the release of polB, which could be beneficial for treating leishmaniasis ulcers. Overall, this study suggests that PBCAnps could be a promising delivery system for leishmaniasis treatments.
The study aimed to identify factors associated with death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The authors analyzed data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health’s SINAN (Reportable Disease Information System) from 2002 to 2009. They used multivariate logistic regression models to identify variables associated with death from VL and developed a prognostic score. The authors found that weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, and age ≥60 years were significantly associated with death in Model 1 (2002–2009). In Model 2 (2007–2009), the authors found that bleeding, other associated infections, jaundice, and age ≥60 years were significantly associated with death. The authors then used Model 2 to develop a prognostic score with a positive predictive value of 28.9% and a negative predictive value of 94.5%. The study suggests that clinical management of patients with VL can be improved to lower mortality.
Plants have cell surface receptors that sense external and internal signals and translate them into appropriate responses. These receptors are called RLKs, and they play a vital role in regulating plant growth, development, and responses to stress. In Arabidopsis, BAK1 is a regulatory RLK that plays a key role in signaling pathways related to plant growth, development, innate immunity, and cell death control. A recent study found that BAK1 regulates these pathways in a differential way, and that its kinase activity is required for the regulation of some pathways. This study has important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of RLKs in plants.
This study proposes a novel method to model the antiproliferative response to anticancer treatment. The method combines time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometry data to build a computational model that can render the proliferative process through the cell cycle and subsequent generations during/after treatment. The effects of treatment were modelled with modules describing the functional activity of the main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase. The final model provided for the first time a complete rendering of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, providing separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. The model was used to disclose the details of the proliferation of a cancer cell population after X-ray exposure, leading to a measure of the dose- and time-dependence of the main checkpoint activities and of the balance between recycling and death over three cell generations after treatment. The study concludes that this approach was used to build a comprehensive model that can help researchers design new treatments and identify potential therapeutic targets.
The article discusses the study of Coenzyme Q (CoQ) deficiency, which has been linked to various human mitochondrial diseases. The study finds that a presumed autoimmune kidney disease in mice with a missense Pdss2kd/kd genotype is actually due to a mitochondrial CoQ biosynthetic defect in glomerular podocytes. The study also shows that mutations in Pdss2 in mice lead to severe neuromuscular disease and nephrotic syndrome, while in humans, they lead to a variety of diseases, including Leigh syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, and primary CoQ deficiency. The study highlights the importance of CoQ in maintaining the function of mitochondria and the role of Pdss2 in the biosynthesis of CoQ. It also emphasizes the need for more research to understand the mechanisms underlying tissue-specific disease manifestations.
Researchers report that the determinative developmental cell lineages of two protostomes and one deuterostome are structured in a way that results in only modest changes to the resulting cellular compositions of the organisms when there are random cell deaths. Several features of the cell lineages, such as their shallowness, topology, early appearances of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types, underlie the robustness. Simple simulations of cell lineage evolution demonstrate that this observed robustness may have arisen as an adaptation to random cell deaths during development. This study reveals general organizing principles of determinative developmental cell lineages and a new conceptual mechanism of phenotypic robustness. This has important implications for development and evolution.
EmbryoPhenomics is a new open-source platform for high-throughput phenomics in aquatic embryos that allows for automated quantification of morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during development. The platform includes an Open-source Video Microscope that produces high-resolution videos of multiple embryos and Embryo Computer Vision software for analyzing the videos. The platform was demonstrated by applying it to two different species, Radix balthica and Orchestia gammarellus, in experiments assessing chronic, acute, and interactive effects of environmental stressors. EmbryoPhenomics has the potential to revolutionize the study of development and phenomics by allowing for the acquisition and processing of data capturing functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest life stages.
Malaria is a major public health problem that causes more than 200 million cases and 438,000 deaths worldwide every year. The parasite, Plasmodium spp., has a complex life cycle that involves both the mosquito and human hosts. The parasite undergoes different stages in the mosquito and human hosts, each of which has a unique metabolic pathway. While the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium are highly glycolytic, the mosquito stages require increased dependence on the TCA cycle and mitochondrial metabolism. In this study, stable isotope labelling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics were used to map stage-specific changes in Plasmodium berghei carbon metabolism and determine the functional significance of these changes on parasite survival in the blood and mosquito stages. The results show that glutamine serves as the predominant input into the TCA cycle in both asexual and sexual blood stages and is important for complete male gametogenesis. Glutamine catabolism, as well as key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis, are also essential for ookinete to oocyst transition in the mosquito. These data highlight significant metabolic differences between Plasmodium species which are not easily anticipated based on genomics or transcriptomics studies, and underline the importance of integration of metabolomics data with other platforms in order to better inform drug discovery and design. The study also opens new avenues for targeting parasite transmission.
The ability of biological signaling pathways to distinguish between different types of signals, such as sustained or oscillatory signals, is important for regulating various biological processes. One common motif found in such networks is the incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL), which consists of an input that simultaneously activates an output and an inhibitor of the output. The IFFL has been shown to play a role in differentiating between pulsatile and sustained signals. By examining the kinetics of the IFFL components and the input signal characteristics, a study found that the ability of the IFFL to process oscillatory signals is limited by two constraints: the input range for which the network can decode pulsatile dynamics and a match between the network parameters and input signal characteristics. The authors suggest that the IFFL is a key component of biological networks that allows them to process and respond to oscillatory signals. This finding has implications for the design of synthetic gene circuits and the study of the mechanisms underlying various biological processes.
Scrub typhus is a serious disease that affects many people in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. It's caused by a type of bacteria called Orientia tsutsugamushi. This bacteria is difficult to culture, so we did experiments to make it easier to grow and store it. This will help researchers to study the disease better and find ways to treat it.
The study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of praziquantel (PZQ) treatment in children aged 1–5 years who are naturally infected with Schistosoma haematobium. Zimbabwean children aged 1–5 years were administered PZQ tablets and their side effects were assessed by a caregiver questionnaire within 24 hours of taking PZQ. Treatment efficacy was determined 6 weeks after PZQ administration by measuring the number of schistosome eggs in the urine. The study compared the change in infection levels in 1–5 year olds to that of 6–10 year olds. Pre-treatment infection intensity in 1–5 year olds was 14.6 eggs/10 ml urine, and prevalence was 21%. PZQ treatment was safe for 1–5 year olds, with 3.8% of children reporting side effects within 24 hours of treatment. PZQ treatment significantly reduced schistosome infection levels in 1–5 year olds with an egg reduction rate (ERR) of 99% and cure rate (CR) of 92%. This was comparable to the efficacy of PZQ in 6–10 year olds, with an ERR of 96% and CR of 67%. PZQ treatment is safe and effective in children aged 1–5 years, and is as efficacious as in older children aged 6–10 years. Therefore, PZQ can be used in children aged 1–5 years to control schistosome infections.
In this study, the authors used fruit flies to identify new pathways and genes involved in tumorigenesis. They discovered several evolutionarily conserved pathways that control the growth of tumors caused by mutations in the small GTPase Ras. They also found several new tumor suppressor genes that work together with Ras to cause tumors. The authors validated their findings by using secondary Drosophila assays. Additionally, they found that the confirmed tumor suppressors were significantly downregulated in human cancers and that their low expression correlated with the KRASG12 mutation status and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. They also experimentally confirmed that one of the new tumor suppressors, Tsp29Fb, regulates EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrains tumor growth and invasion.
Meiotic drivers are selfish genes that can bias their own transmission into progeny by killing off gametes that do not inherit them. We discovered that the wtf13 gene found in lab strains of Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a meiotic driver. We also found that wtf13 makes a poison that kills off spores that do not inherit it, and an antidote that rescues only the spores that inherit it. The wtf13 driver is suppressed by another wtf gene, wtf18-2, that arose spontaneously in the lab. Wtf18-2 makes only an antidote that rescues spores that inherit it, but it does not act indiscriminately. Instead, it rescues only the spores that inherit it from destruction by wtf13. This type of suppression of meiotic drive has not been seen before and provides insight into the mechanisms and evolution of drive systems.
In this study, the authors explore the relationship between genetic variation and expression variation in humans. They use a machine learning algorithm to predict the expression of unseen individuals based on their genetic sequence variation. The algorithm takes into account both the genetic information of the predicted gene and its local genomic environment. The authors compare different algorithms and find that two different multi-SNP algorithms and one single-SNP algorithm are highly accurate in predicting gene expression. The predictions are robust and can be made in advance with high accuracy. The authors also find that incorporating individuals from other populations improves the predictions of a given population, suggesting that some of the SNPs that are associated with expression changes are shared across populations. The authors conclude that the time may be ripe for a broader examination of this important prediction task.
Malaria infections often have multiple strains, and these strains compete with each other for resources and can also trigger different immune responses. This study uses mathematical models and experimental data to investigate the cause of competitive suppression between two strains of a parasite in mice. The authors found that the ratio of background loss rate of merozoites to invasion rate of mature red blood cells needs to be clone-specific to predict the data. The competitive suppression acts early in infection, even before the day of peak parasitaemia, and the innate immune response clearing merozoites is likely to be the most important mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avirulent clones.
A group of researchers has developed a new model for how inverted copies of DNA are created in eukaryotic genomes. They called this model ODIRA, for "origin-dependent inverted-repeat amplification." They showed that this model is consistent with the structure of a previously sequenced amplicon containing the SUL1 locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The researchers used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to test the model and found that it can explain the formation of inverted amplicons in humans. They also provided evidence that the model can explain the origin of interstitial inverted copy number variations.
Influenza virus infection alters the way cells make proteins. This study uses a combination of computer analysis and experimental techniques to investigate how this happens. First, the study uses computer analysis to find evidence that influenza viruses have adapted to use only certain parts of their genome to make proteins. This adaptation is called translation initiation and it refers to the way that the virus uses a particular starting point on its genetic material to make a protein. Next, the study uses a technique called ribosome profiling to find evidence of different starting points for translation initiation in the influenza virus genome and in the host's own genetic material. The study finds that there are several different starting points for translation initiation that can make different versions of a protein. The study also finds that the host's own genetic material is more likely to have different starting points for translation initiation during the anti-viral response, which is when the body fights back against the virus. Overall, the study provides new insights into how influenza virus infection affects protein production in cells.
EHEC is a type of bacteria that can cause severe bloody diarrhea in humans. It is transmitted to humans through various means, such as contaminated beef, vegetables, water, or through contact with animals. EHEC can also cause a potentially fatal kidney disease called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). EHEC and other enteric pathogens use a type III secretion system to inject virulence proteins into host cells. These virulence proteins, such as NleH1 and NleH2, disrupt host cell function to promote diarrheal disease and bacterial transmission. In this study, the authors found that NleH1 and NleH2 bind to RPS3, a subunit of NF-κB transcriptional complexes, which helps regulate the host innate immune response. They also found that NleH1 reduces the nuclear abundance of RPS3 and represses NF-κB-dependent transcription, while NleH2 stimulates RPS3-dependent transcription and activates AP-1-dependent transcription. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which bacterial effectors disrupt host innate responses to infection.
The article presents a new method for modeling transcription factor (TF) binding specificities called feature motif models (FMMs). The approach is based on log-linear models that use sequence features to represent TF binding specificities. The authors develop the mathematical formulation of the model and devise an algorithm for learning its structural features from binding site data. The algorithm is tested on synthetic data and on the widely used TF chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harbison et al. The authors then apply their algorithm to high-throughput TF ChIP data from mouse and human, reveal sequence features that are present in the binding specificities of mouse and human TFs, and show that FMMs explain TF binding significantly better than PSSMs. Their FMM learning and motif finder software are available at http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/.
The sympathetic nervous system helps us respond to danger. The adrenergic receptor α2C (ADRA2C) helps control how much adrenaline the sympathetic nervous system releases. Knockout mice for this gene show changes in behavior and physiology, such as increased heart rate and blood pressure. There is evidence that ADRA2C may have been under selection during the domestication of dogs and chickens. To learn more about the function of ADRA2C, researchers looked at the DNA sequence of this gene in humans, chimpanzees, and other primates. They found that the DNA sequence of ADRA2C is different in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. They also found that the regulatory regions of this gene have been accelerated in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. The researchers found that a particular region of ADRA2C has a lot of active histone marks in the rhesus macaque, while it has a lot of repressive marks in humans and chimpanzees. This region of ADRA2C has two binding sites for neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF). One of these binding sites has a polymorphism that has been associated with lower levels of ADRA2C in the brain. The researchers found that both of the derived nucleotides at this site repress ADRA2C, most likely by increasing the binding of NRSF. The researchers also found evidence of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans, indicating that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.
C4 photosynthesis is a way for plants to make food that is more efficient in hot, tropical climates. This type of photosynthesis has evolved independently many times in different types of plants. Scientists wanted to learn more about how these different types of plants use the same genes and molecules to make C4 photosynthesis work. They did this by studying two different types of C4 plants, one from the monocotyledons and one from the dicotyledons, which are two groups of plants that have different ways of making food. They found that even though these plants are very different, they use many of the same genes and molecules to make C4 photosynthesis work. This is interesting because it means that there are some things that all plants that make C4 photosynthesis have in common. This could help scientists to make plants that make food more efficiently.
An Ebola virus ( EBOV ) outbreak occurred in West Africa in 2013-2016. The outbreak started in Sierra Leone, and it spread to other parts of Africa, Europe and North America. Several people were infected with EBOV while providing care in Europe and North America, and some of them died. Researchers wanted to learn more about how the virus spreads within the human body and to develop better ways to treat and prevent the spread of the virus. They studied the levels of EBOV genetic material ( RNA ) in the upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract, and plasma of a HCW who was infected with EBOV in Sierra Leone and hospitalized at INMI in Rome, Italy. They found that the virus continued to replicate and spread in the lower respiratory tract even after it was cleared from the plasma. This suggests that EBOV may spread more easily through the respiratory system than previously thought. The researchers hope that this information will help them to develop better ways to treat and prevent the spread of the virus. However, they need to do more research to better understand the significance of the virus replication and spread in the respiratory tract.
A recent study investigated a virus called Machupo virus, which causes a hemorrhagic fever known as Bolivian hemorrhagic fever. The virus belongs to a group called New World arenaviruses. The study used a virus called Junin virus, which causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever, as a template to create a new virus. The new virus was modified to be less virulent and to stimulate the immune system to fight against the virus. The study used several different versions of the virus to determine which specific parts of the virus were important for making it less virulent and more effective at stimulating the immune system. The study found that each part of the virus played an important role in making the virus less virulent and more effective.
The centromeric histone 3 variant ( CENH3 ) is a protein that plays an important role in the segregation of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis. To better understand its function, researchers created a mutant version of CENH3 by changing a single amino acid. This mutant version of CENH3 was able to grow and reproduce normally when self-pollinated, but it caused post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. This finding suggests that even a single amino acid change in CENH3 can cause significant changes in how the protein functions. The researchers also used this mutant version of CENH3 to identify non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized collections of crop species.
A new study has investigated the role of alternative splicing (AS) in the self-renewal, pluripotency, and tissue lineage specification of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). AS is a process in which genes produce multiple mRNA transcripts that differ in their inclusion of exons and introns. The study used exon-level microarray expression data from undifferentiated hESCs and cardiac and neural precursors to identify splice isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural differentiation expression patterns. The splice events for these groups corresponded to pathways related to cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle checkpoint control. The study also identified novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that were predicted to affect protein function and expression. These included an enrichment of splice isoforms that oppose cell-cycle arrest in hESCs and promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors. By combining genome-wide predictions of alternative splicing with new functional annotations, the study suggests potential mechanisms that may influence lineage commitment and hESC maintenance at the level of specific splice isoforms and microRNA regulation.
The study investigates the role of OtsB2, a phosphatase that breaks down a sugar molecule called trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) in the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The authors generated a mutant of M. tuberculosis that can shut down the expression of the otsB2 gene, allowing them to study the role of OtsB2 in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that otsB2 is essential for growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and for acute infection in mice. However, otsB2 is not essential for the chronic infection phase in mice. Blocking the activity of OtsB2 caused an accumulation of T6P, which is toxic and led to the self-poisoning of cells. The authors also identified other genes that are essential for growth in the presence of a T6P phosphatase inhibitor, which could be used as targets for combination therapies to minimize the emergence of resistance to OtsB2 inhibitors.
In this study, the authors used computer simulations to study the opening movement of a protein called Trypanosoma cruzi proline racemase (TcPR). The opening movement of TcPR is important because it has been linked to the protein's ability to evade the host immune response in Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease. The authors used a technique called accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) to simulate the opening movement of TcPR. aMD is a computational method that extends the effective simulation time scale of conventional molecular dynamics simulations. The authors found that the opening movement of TcPR involves two global motions: an inter-domain motion that exposes several conserved residues located in the monomer-monomer interface and an intra-domain opening movement that exposes highly conserved segments around the active site region of TcPR. The authors also found that the open form of TcPR exposes several potential binding pockets that could be targeted by drugs to treat Chagas disease. Overall, the study provides important information about the opening movement of TcPR and its potential role in the pathogenesis of Chagas disease.
In this paper, researchers have developed a new way to turn genes on or off at will in mice. They used two genetically modified mice lines - one with a "tetracycline-dependent transactivator" replacing the endogenous target gene, and another with a "tetracycline-inducible cDNA" of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated genomic locus. These two lines can be combined to create a system that allows for the efficient and reversible inactivation of a target gene in mice. The researchers used this system to create a new mouse model for studying the effects of cholesterol on the development of atherosclerosis. They turned the ApoE gene on or off using doxycycline and found that this system allowed them to switch the atherosclerotic phenotype of the mice back and forth with great precision. This new mouse model will be useful for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis progression and regression.
The study aims to understand how the placenta responds to congenital infection by Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease. The researchers used a functional genomics approach, analyzing gene expression in mice infected with two different T. cruzi strains. They found that the placenta environment showed a strong immune response to infection, but certain pathways were also downregulated, including metabolic processes and macromolecular transport. The study suggests that this immune response may help control the infection, but it could also contribute to problems such as premature birth and growth retardation.
The article discusses a mosquito-borne disease called Ockelbo disease or Pogosta disease, which is caused by the Sindbis virus (SINV). The disease occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical countries and in northern Europe, where it is believed to cause regular reoccurring outbreaks. To better understand this disease and its outbreaks, the article evaluates the prevalence of SINV in mosquitoes from an endemic area in central Sweden over three consecutive years before, during, and after an hypothesized outbreak year. The authors found that increased SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes was the most valuable marker for further scrutinizing the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks and the mechanisms behind. The study provides important information for understanding the periodicity of outbreaks and for developing effective strategies for preventing and controlling mosquito-borne diseases.
The locust olfactory system is a well-studied example of how a neural circuit can transform inputs into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB) that is important for memory. Recordings of neurons in the MB show that only a few Kenyon cells (KCs) respond to a specific odor at any given time, which is different from the AL where many neurons respond to each odor. In this study, the authors used a biologically plausible model to explore how the circuit may control and tune synaptic weights to ensure the specificity of KCs' responses. The model found that plasticity at the synapses between the AL and MB can efficiently regulate the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter the intense AL oscillatory output and condense it to a sparse representation in the MB. This suggests a role for plasticity in information processing and makes a testable prediction about synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses.
The goal of the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study was to find groups of genes that work together (rather than individual genes) to cause coronary artery disease (CAD). To do this, researchers looked at the expression of different genes in different organs, such as the liver, skeletal muscle, and fat, as well as in the arteries themselves. They found that some groups of genes in these different organs were linked to each other and to the development of CAD. This means that the function of these groups of genes may work together in different organs to cause CAD. The researchers also found that some genes were linked to the development of CAD in more than one organ. This means that these genes may work together in different organs to cause CAD. Overall, this study provides new information about how different organs may work together to cause CAD.
The article reports that KaiC, the main protein of the circadian clock in cyanobacteria, is involved in the regulation of its own gene expression. Specifically, it was found that different phospho-states of KaiC have different effects on the expression of the kaiBC genes, which encode other components of the circadian clock. The article presents a mathematical model that simulates the expression of kaiBC genes under different scenarios of KaiC regulation, including different phospho-states and different levels of KaiC expression. The model suggests that only one particular two-loop feedback mechanism is able to accurately reproduce the experimental observations on the regulation of kaiBC expression. The article discusses the parallels between this feedback mechanism and the two-loop feedback structures found in mammalian clocks.
This study aimed to investigate whether HIV-2 follows the same distribution pattern of attenuated HIV-1/SIV infections, with limited infection of central-memory CD4 T lymphocytes (TCM). The study included HIV-2 infected individuals from the ANRS-CO5 cohort. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were sorted into monocytes and resting CD4 T-cell subsets (TN, TCM, TTM, and TEM). Reactivation of HIV-2 was tested in 30-day cultures of CD8-depleted PBMCs. HIV-2 DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. Cell surface markers, co-receptors, and restriction factors were analyzed by flow-cytometry and multiplex transcriptomic study. The study found that HIV-2 DNA was undetectable in monocytes, quantifiable in TTM but not in TCM. HIV-2 DNA levels in PBMCs positively correlated with those in TTM but not in TCM. HIV-2 reactivation was observed in cells from only three individuals. The study also found that CXCR6 was distributed similarly in cell populations from individuals and donors, but TCM had a lower expression of CXCR6 transcripts than TTM, and a higher expression of TRIM5. These findings suggest that the low HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 reservoirs by the lack of monocytic infection and limited infection of TCM associated with a lower expression of a potential alternative HIV-2 co-receptor, CXCR6, and a higher expression of a restriction factor, TRIM5. These findings suggest that the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection is due to mechanisms similar to those observed in other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infection models.
Attentional processing is a set of effects on the activity and selectivity of cortical neurons that have been studied extensively in recent decades. However, there is still a need for detailed mechanistic models that explain these effects and provide testable predictions. In this study, the authors present a new model called the Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) that aims to explain selective attentional processing in cortex. The model is described mathematically and implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons. The authors use the ARC to simulate three studies of attention in macaque and demonstrate that the model can quantitatively match several observed forms of attentional modulation, including shifting and shrinking of receptive fields, increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features, and response gain effects in neuronal contrast-response functions. The authors claim that the ARC provides a unified explanation of these attentional effects, overcomes limitations of past models, and makes several detailed testable predictions.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common condition that causes a rapid and irregular heartbeat. While current treatments for AF have limited effectiveness, it is known that AF is heritable. There have been several studies that have identified many genes that are associated with AF, but it is not yet clear how much of the risk for AF is caused by genetic factors. In this study, researchers analyzed the genomes of 1,734 people with AF and 9,423 people without AF. They found that a common missense variant in the SYNPO2L gene was associated with a higher risk for AF. However, no other coding genetic variations were found to be significantly associated with AF. This suggests that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF. The researchers did not find any evidence that rare coding variations were associated with AF. Additionally, they found that individuals with AF did not have any statistically significant enrichment for common or rare coding variation in known AF genes. In conclusion, the researchers did not find any strong evidence linking coding genetic variations to AF, but they did identify a potential causal variant in the SYNPO2L gene that may contribute to the risk for AF. Further studies may be needed to understand the role of genetic factors in AF and to develop new treatments.
The paper is about alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a disease caused by the larval stage of a parasite called Echinococcus multilocularis. The disease has been found in 42 countries of the northern hemisphere. In Europe, the highest occurrence of the disease is in France, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria. In the last half-century, the most common cases of human AE in Europe were reported in these countries. Recently, many cases of human AE have been reported from China. The authors of this paper were interested in the number of cases of human AE in Poland. They looked at data from official sources and found that there were 121 cases between 1990 and 2011. Most of the cases were in people between the ages of 6 and 82, with a mean age of 47.7 years. The sex ratio was 0.86 male to 1 female. The disease was fatal in 19% of cases, with a mean age of death of 54.1 years. The authors found that there was an increase in the number of cases of human AE in Poland over the past two decades, which is concerning. They also found that the disease occurred mainly in areas where there were many infected red foxes, which is a sign that foxes might be spreading the disease. The authors recommend that a wider national programme for screening in high-risk areas be implemented, along with efforts to increase public awareness and train primary care physicians to recognize the disease early.
The article discusses the way bacteria regulate their response to changes in zinc levels, a process that is essential for the functioning of the bacteria. In response to changes in zinc levels, bacteria use a protein called Zur to regulate gene expression. The article provides information on the molecular mechanism of Zur and how it regulates gene expression at each of the known Zur-regulated genes in Escherichia coli. The article also describes the discovery of a new member of the Zur-regulon, pliG, and the thermodynamic profile of Zur-DNA interactions that correlates with the physiological response at different promoters. The article concludes that the number of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) -family dimers that bind within any given promoter varies significantly, and that the Zur-DNA interactions directly correlate with the physiological response at different promoters.
Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is a mosquito-borne zoonosis that causes high morbidity and mortality in ruminants and humans. A recent RVF outbreak occurred in Madagascar highlands, but no wild reservoir species were identified. A three-year serological follow-up in cattle showed recurrent RVFV circulation, but without direct transmission between cattle. To understand this recurrent transmission, a spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed and parameterized to reproduce the local conditions. The model suggested that both a low-level vector-borne transmission during winter and a direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve were involved in the recurrent transmission. This study highlights the importance of considering both vector-borne and direct transmission mechanisms when analyzing RVF outbreaks.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly invasive and dangerous mosquito that poses a public health threat. Its movements and population structure in the Indo-Pacific region were analyzed using nuclear microsatellite markers and mitochondrial COI sequences. The study found that Ae. albopictus was most likely introduced to New Guinea from mainland Southeast Asia before colonizing the Solomon Islands. Additionally, the study found evidence of a recently colonized population on the Torres Strait Islands, Australia, that had undergone rapid temporal changes in its genetic makeup. The study highlights the importance of understanding the invasion history and genetic structure of invasive species, especially in cases like this one where the species has a high dispersibility mediated by human activities.
In this study, researchers wanted to determine if infection with the parasite Schistosoma mansoni has any negative effects on children's physical health, growth, and well-being. To do this, they looked at the impact of the parasite on a variety of morbidity indicators, such as physical fitness and quality of life, among 572 schoolchildren aged 7-8 years in Mwanza Region, Tanzania. The researchers found that although S. mansoni infections are quite common in the area, they were not associated with the morbidity indicators they were looking at. This suggests that other factors, such as malnutrition and poor living conditions, may be more important causes of physical weakness and decreased quality of life in these children.
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that affects humans and animals, including rats. The bacteria can spread through direct contact with urine or other body fluids of infected animals. The study aimed to investigate the effects of different inoculation routes on the renal colonization and urinary excretion of leptospirosis in adult rats. The three inoculation routes studied were intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, and mucosal. The study found that mucosal inoculation was more efficient for renal colonization than subcutaneous inoculation, but caused a slower-progressing infection than intraperitoneal inoculation. The study also investigated the potential for other excretion routes, such as saliva or feces, but found no evidence of infection through these routes. Overall, the study provides valuable information on the effects of different inoculation routes on leptospirosis infection in rats, which could help to better understand the disease and its transmission in natural settings.
Sepsis is a serious disease that occurs when the body's response to infection causes harm to its own organs. There are limited treatments for sepsis, so researchers are trying to understand how it works. They found that a protein called AnxA2 helps to control inflammation during sepsis. When AnxA2 is missing, the inflammatory response is stronger and organs fail more quickly. The researchers also found that AnxA2 works by controlling a molecule called ROS and a chemical messenger called IL-17A.
The study investigates the role of polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in suppressing HIV-1 infection in macrophages, which are known to play a key role in HIV-1 pathogenesis and disease progression. The authors found that poly (I:C) and LPS decreased HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages, but the mechanism of this effect is incompletely understood. The authors found that increased miR-155 levels in TLR3/4-stimulated but not TLR7-stimulated MDMs resulted in reduced HIV-1 infection, and ectopic expression of miR-155 greatly reduced HIV-1 infection in MDMs and cell lines. Furthermore, increased miR-155 levels resulted in an accumulation of late RT products and an absence or reduction in integrated pro-viruses, and reduced the mRNA and protein levels of several HIV-1 dependency factors. The authors suggest that miR-155 exerts an anti-HIV-1 effect by targeting several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection.
In this paper, researchers studied how plants regulate their growth based on the amount of light and time of day. They found that light and time of day affect plant growth and development. They also found that hormones called phytohormones play an important role in plant growth. These hormones include gibberellins, auxins, brassinosteroids, abscisic acid, cytokinins, and ethylene. The researchers found that these hormones work together in specific ways to control growth. They also found that certain genes related to these hormones are regulated by the circadian clock and light signaling. The researchers propose a model that explains how plants use the circadian clock to control their growth based on the amount of light and time of day.
The study aimed to use RNA interference (RNAi) as a method for controlling insect vectors of Chagas disease. Rhodnius prolixus, a sylvatic vector of Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), was used as a model insect. The study showed that Escherichia coli and Rhodococcus rhodnii could effectively deliver dsRNA specific for two important genes in insect development and fecundity: Rhodnius heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT). The RNAi effect was systemic and temporal, with significant knockdown of the two genes in the fat body, anterior and posterior midgut, and ovaries. This study suggests that RNAi could be a useful method for controlling insect vectors of Chagas disease.
Pregnancy and fever are not healthy for mother and baby. In the 1980s, malaria was a big cause of death for pregnant women in refugee camps on the Thai-Burmese border. But now, malaria is less common there. So, doctors wanted to find out what other things were causing fever in pregnant women. They checked 438 pregnant women who came to antenatal clinics and had a fever. Most of the time, the cause of fever was malaria, but there were other causes too, like typhus, leptospirosis, rickettsia, and a bacterial infection called pyelonephritis. Doctors also found that when malaria, pyelonephritis, and acute respiratory illness were ruled out, one-third of the remaining febrile infections were caused by rickettsia or leptospirosis. Scrub typhus and murine typhus were also causes of fever in pregnant women on the Thai-Burmese border, and they were linked to poor pregnancy outcomes like stillbirth and low birth weight. The doctors recommend using azithromycin to treat febrile pregnant women on the Thai-Burmese border who don't have malaria, pyelonephritis, or respiratory tract infection.
The number of times a chromosome breaks and rearranges during meiosis (the process of making gametes for reproduction) is different for each person and for each gamete (sperm or egg). This variation is important because it may be linked to the genetic diversity of the population. Some studies have shown that gametes with more crossovers (places where two chromosomes swap genetic material) have a better chance of surviving. However, it's not clear how old a person's gametes are or if that affects their chance of survival. This study aimed to find out if there is a connection between a mother's age and how many crossovers her gametes have. They used a large number of genetic markers to identify crossover events in a panel of 69 families. They found that in general, the rate of recombination decreased with age. However, this decrease was not consistent across all chromosomes, and it seemed to be localized in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions. The authors propose a model that explains how this could be related to the higher rates of aneuploidy (the presence of more than two sets of chromosomes) seen in older women. They suggest that for some chromosomes, the protection against non-disjunction provided by recombination may become less efficient with age. This study provides new insight into the relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans.
This study is about developing a new type of vaccine that can protect immunocompromised patients from disease. This new type of vaccine is designed to boost the innate immune system of the host, which is a type of immune response that occurs quickly and does not require previous exposure to the pathogen. The study uses a fungal vaccine model to test this new approach in mice. The vaccine is designed to trigger an immune response by the host's immune system, and this response is then maintained for a long period of time, even after the initial immune response has faded. The researchers found that the vaccine was able to provide complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells. This means that the vaccine was able to protect the host even if their adaptive immune system was compromised, such as in HIV/AIDS patients. The researchers found that the vaccine triggered a pathogen-specific immune response that was dependent on changes in histone methylation and acetylation, and that this response was associated with increased STAT1 binding to promoter regions of genes associated with protective anti-fungal immunity. Overall, this study shows that a new type of vaccine that enhances innate immune responses can provide complete protection against secondary challenge in immunocompromised patients.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play a crucial role in repressing gene expression and development in plants and animals. In plants, different members of PRCs have overlapping and unique functions. The function of PRCs is determined by specific members of the complexes. To understand how PRCs function, researchers compared the changes in H3K27me3 levels (a repressive epigenetic mark) in Arabidopsis mutants lacking different PRC components. They found that the Arabidopsis mutant clf , which lacks the major catalytic subunit of PRC2, specifically repressed flower development genes. In contrast, the Arabidopsis mutant lhp1 , which lacks a PRC1 component, specifically repressed embryo development genes. The authors propose that different combinations of PRC members repress different developmental programs and that their target specificity is modulated by specific transcription factors (TFs).
The trigger loop (TL) of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is an important part of the enzyme that is involved in the selection of nucleotides and transcription, the process by which the enzyme synthesizes RNA. In this study, the authors wanted to understand the TL at an individual-residue level and how it contributes to transcription. They used a technique called deep mutational scanning to study nearly all single variants of the TL en masse and discovered three classes of mutant that had distinct phenotypes linked to transcription defects or stress response profiles. They found that some mutations disrupted an intra-TL hydrophobic pocket, which was proposed to provide a mechanism for substrate-triggered TL folding, while others altered the distribution of TL residues. They also found genetic interactions among TL residues that support their contribution to TL dynamics, which is essential for the next nucleotide addition cycle. The study provides a phenotypic framework for studying the TL and allows for a better understanding of how RNA polymerase II functions during transcription.
Rabies is a deadly brain disease in animals, caused by rabies virus (RV) - a type of virus that infects the nervous system and causes a lethal encephalopathy. Most RV infections occur from bites or scratches from rabid carnivores or bats. The virus uses the neuronal network to spread from the infection site to the central nervous system (CNS) where it replicates and infects other neurons via trans-synaptic spread. However, there is evidence that hematogenous spread from the infection site directly to the brain might be an alternative way for RV to invade the CNS. To investigate this possibility, scientists infected mice either intramuscularly (i. m. ) or intravenously (i. v. ) with the dog-associated RV strain DOG4 or the silver-haired bat-associated RV strain SB. They monitored the progression of clinical signs of rabies and used immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to track the spread of the virus from the infection site to the brain. While both i. m. and i. v. infection with SB caused lethal encephalopathy, only i. v. infection with SB resulted in a fatal infection. qRT-PCR did not reveal major differences in virus loads in spinal cord or brain at different times after i. m. or i. v. infection of SB. However, immunohistochemical analysis showed that only i. v. administered SB directly infected the forebrain. The earliest affected regions were those hypothalamic nuclei that are connected by neurosecretory fibers to the circumventricular organs neurohypophysis and median eminence. These findings suggest that hematogenous spread of SB can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. This alternative mode of virus spread has implications for the post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly for silver-haired bat-associated RV.
The H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused substantial disease burden in humans, first documented in the global pandemic of 1918 and continuing to the present day. Despite its impact, the evolutionary history of the A/H1N1 virus is not well understood, particularly whether there is a virological basis for several notable epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s. Using a data set of 71 complete genome sequences sampled between 1918 and 2006, we found that segmental reassortment played an important role in the genomic evolution of A/H1N1 since 1918. Specifically, we discovered that an A/H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may also have been associated with reassortant A/H1N1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassortment therefore appears to be a more important process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously realized.
Nicotine activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain, which leads to an increase in dopamine (DA) output. There are two main theories about how nicotine does this: direct stimulation of DA cells, or disinhibition of DA cells through the desensitization of nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons. We used a computer model of the VTA circuitry and nAChR function to test these theories. Our model suggests that the α4β2-containing nAChRs either on DA or GABA cells can mediate the acute effects of nicotine. We found that the rate of endogenous acetylcholine input is crucial for the evoked DA response for both mechanisms. Together, our results suggest that the desensitization of nAChRs on GABA cells is a key factor in the mediation of nicotine reinforcement.
The study aimed to test a new concept for treating anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania (L.) tropica infection, which is a chronic infection that can cause disfiguring skin lesions and limit therapeutic options. The treatment involved bipolar high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) to clean the wound, followed by moist wound treatment with or without pharmaceutical sodium chlorite (DAC N-055). The study was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan from 2004 to 2008 and included 108 patients. The study found that the treatment accelerated wound closure and improved the cosmetic outcome of CL lesions. The study also found that DAC N-055 caused a more rapid wound epithelialization in a subgroup of patients with parasite persistence, which warrants future studies on the activity of DAC N-055.
The small GTPase RAS is one of the most common cancer-causing genes and transmits proliferative signals through an evolutionarily conserved pathway known as the RAF-MEK-MAPK module. In order to better understand this pathway and identify new components that regulate it, researchers in Drosophila conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen, which led to the discovery of 101 validated hits, including most of the previously known components associated with this pathway. Epistasis experiments were then performed on individual candidates to determine their regulatory input, and unexpectedly, most hits were found to work downstream of MEK and specifically affect MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors that suggest that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. The study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors that modulate RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila and indicates that core splicing components can also specifically impact alternative splicing.
A study was done to get a better understanding of cryptococcosis in Thailand. This study used 498 strains of Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii, which were collected from different sources, including humans, animals, and the environment. The study found that 94.8% of the strains were C. neoformans and were mostly the VNI molecular type, which was the same for strains found in the environment, animals, and humans. The study also found that 2.4% of the strains were C. gattii and belonged to the VGII molecular type. The study showed that C. neoformans var. neoformans and C. gattii were present in Thailand before, but this study found more strains of C. neoformans than C. gattii.
The paper investigates how changes in the DNA-binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) may contribute to the evolution of regulatory networks in Drosophila. To do this, they compare the DNA-binding specificities of C2H2-ZF TFs, a common class of TFs found in metazoans, across 12 species of Drosophila. They found that a significant fraction of C2H2-ZF TFs exhibit changes in DNA-contacting residues, which may affect their DNA-binding specificities. These changes were not found in all species and tended to be more common in more distantly related species. They also found that these changes tended to be conserved across phylogenetic clades and were unlikely to be the result of random mutations. These findings suggest that C2H2-ZF TFs may be an important source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and other metazoans.
Scientists have developed a new type of test to quickly and accurately identify Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A. These tests use DNA from cultured isolates of these two bacteria. This new test can help doctors diagnose typhoid and paratyphoid fevers more quickly and accurately, which is particularly important in countries where these diseases are common. The test can also be used to monitor the prevalence of these diseases and help guide public health policies such as vaccination campaigns and water sanitation measures.
In the immune system, a type of white blood cell called T helper 1 (Th1) cells fight against intracellular parasites like bacteria and viruses. These cells produce a special protein called interferon-gamma (IFNγ) that helps to kill the parasites. Notch receptors are a type of protein that can help to decide whether a cell will become one type of cell or another. Researchers wanted to know if Notch receptors were important for the differentiation of Th1 cells. They used mice with different types of genetic defects to study this question. The researchers found that when the mice were infected with a type of parasite called Leishmania major, the mice with certain types of genetic defects had trouble differentiating into Th1 cells. This led to problems fighting off the infection. The researchers concluded that Notch receptors are important for the differentiation of Th1 cells and that these cells are important for fighting off certain types of intracellular parasites.
HIV-1 infection is more common in sub-Saharan Africa than anywhere else, even though this region has only 10% of the world's population. The high HIV-1 infection rates in this region may be connected to parasite infections that affect many people in developing countries. However, this has never been tested in a relevant animal model before. In our study, we tested whether infection with a worm called Schistosoma mansoni would increase a monkey's risk of getting HIV-1 after being exposed to the virus through the rectum. We found that monkeys with parasite infections became infected with HIV-1 at much lower doses than monkeys without parasite infections. These monkeys also had much higher levels of the virus in their immune cells. This is the first evidence that acute parasite infections can increase the risk of getting HIV-1, and the magnitude of this effect suggests that controlling parasite infections could be a helpful public health intervention to reduce the spread of HIV-1.
The article discusses the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on cortical neural activity during sleep. ACh is a neurotransmitter that influences arousal and sleep states, and its levels increase during the transition from non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep to waking or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Experiments have shown that ACh can affect neural excitability in two ways: reducing spike frequency adaptation (SFA) and changing the phase response curve (PRC). The PRC describes how a neuron responds to external input, and a shift from a biphasic type 2 PRC to a monophasic type 1 PRC induced by ACh has been observed. The authors used a conductance-based (Hodgkin-Huxley) cortical network model and a Mexican-hat type of connectivity scheme to simulate the effects of ACh on network dynamics. They demonstrated that the reduction of SFA and the balance between excitation and inhibition led to different network dynamics, including moving and stationary dynamics, and highly local and global dynamics. The authors also studied the properties of these dynamics and their transition and found that ACh-driven reduction of SFA was responsible for the transition from moving to stationary dynamics, while E/I balance determined the spatial and temporal extent of network upstates. Finally, the authors showed that SFA and E/I balance shape network activity by setting the spatial and temporal extent of network upstates, respectively.
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a cancer that develops in the esophagus, the tube-like organ that connects the mouth to the stomach. EAC is becoming more common, but it has a poor survival rate. The main risk factor for EAC is a condition called Barrett's esophagus, which can develop when stomach acid and bile irritate the lining of the esophagus over time. This causes inflammation and damages the DNA of the cells in the esophagus, leading to mutations that can eventually cause cancer. However, many of these mutations are not in well-known cancer genes, making it hard to identify which mutations are important for the development of EAC. In this study, the authors used computer programs to look for patterns of mutations in the genomes of 171 patients with EAC. They found that many of these mutations were in genes that are part of a pathway called the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway. The TLR pathway is important for recognizing and responding to infections, and it is also involved in cancer. The authors also found that mutations in TLR4, a gene in the TLR pathway, are common in EAC and reduce the ability of the pathway to respond to infections. This could help cancer cells grow and survive. The authors also looked at other types of cancer and found that mutations in the TLR pathway are also common in those cancers. This suggests that the TLR pathway may be important for the development of many different types of cancer.
Taste buds are small sensory organs that help animals recognize things they like to eat and things they shouldn't eat. These organs are made up of many spindle-shaped cells. There are three different types of these cells: type I, type II, and type III. Type II cells are the cells that help animals taste sweet, bitter, and umami flavors. These cells use a group of proteins called taste receptor calcium signaling molecules (TRCSMs) to help them sense these flavors. Some studies have looked at how these cells develop, but the process is not completely clear. We used a new approach to study how these cells develop by using computer analysis to look at the proteins that might be involved in regulating their development. We found that a protein called Hes1 might play a role in helping these cells develop. We then looked at Hes1 expression in mice and found that it was linked to the development of type II taste cells. This means that Hes1 might be important for helping these cells develop.
A recent study aimed to understand the interaction between ethylene and auxin in regulating rice root growth. Researchers found that the YUC8 gene, which encodes a flavin-containing monooxygenase, is involved in the conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the main form of auxin in plants. They also found that ethylene stimulates the expression of YUC8 and promotes auxin accumulation in rice roots. The study revealed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis in rice seedlings. The researchers further identified a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, in which YUC8/REIN7 is truncated at its C-terminus. Mutation in YUC8/REIN7 reduced auxin biosynthesis in rice, while YUC8/REIN7 overexpression enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots. The study provides important insights into the complex interaction between ethylene and auxin in regulating root growth in rice.
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are bacteria that can cause pulmonary and extrapulmonary diseases. Recent research has shown that there are increasing instances of NTM diseases globally. However, there is currently limited knowledge of the NTM epidemic situation in Saudi Arabia. To address this gap in knowledge, a nationwide systematic epidemiological study on NTM diseases was conducted for a period of 24 months. During this study, 527 isolates of NTM were collected and identified using various methods. The most common species of NTM identified were Mycobacterium simiae, Mycobacterium fortuitum, and Mycobacterium abscessus. The study also identified several rare species of NTM and new cases of clinically relevant Mycobacterium riyadhense. Diabetes mellitus and a history of tuberculosis were identified as independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases. The study highlights the need for more research and resources to address the increasing incidence of NTM diseases globally.
In the study, researchers found that in budding yeast, starvation for glucose or any other macronutrient causes the yeast cells to exit from the mitotic cell cycle and enter a state of quiescence, which helps them to survive longer. The researchers screened a subset of yeast deletion strains that represent genes encoding signaling proteins to identify the molecules that are necessary for proper quiescence establishment and extension of chronological lifespan (CLS). The results of the study suggest that entry into quiescence requires the integration of starvation signals transmitted via multiple signaling pathways, including the TOR pathway. The researchers found that the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species are cooperatively controlled by Yak1, Rim15, and Mck1, and the three kinases mediate the TOR-regulated accumulation of storage carbohydrates and CLS extension. The researchers conclude that metabolic reprogramming to accumulate energy stores and the activation of anti-oxidant defence systems are coordinated by Yak1, Rim15, and Mck1 kinases to ensure quiescence entry and lifespan extension in yeast.
Influenza viruses are able to persist and evolve to escape herd immunity through the acquisition of mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein. These mutations can compensate for fitness costs imposed by Ab-escape by adding N-linked glycans to the HA globular domain, which can increase the viability of Ab-escape variants.
Some antiarrhythmic drugs slow down the heartbeat, making the heart more resistant to arrhythmias. However, these drugs can cause more serious problems if the heart rate is too slow. Scientists have been trying to find new antiarrhythmic drugs that can slow down the heartbeat when it is too fast and speed it up when it is too slow. The new drugs should be able to change the heartbeat in a way that is forward rate dependent, meaning that they work better when the heart is beating faster. In this study, scientists used computer simulations to test different combinations of drugs and see how they affected the heartbeat. They found that some drugs can make the heartbeat forward rate dependent, and that these drugs could be new antiarrhythmic drugs.
The study presents new methods for performing Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS) that use International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes and biological test results. These methods allow for the analysis of quantitative traits and the identification of associated phenotypes. The authors tested these methods by analyzing thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in patients treated with thiopurine drugs. They developed two methods for aggregating ICD-10 codes: an ICD-10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes. Additionally, 11 biological test results were analyzed using discretization algorithms. The study included 442 patient records from a French academic hospital between January 2000 and July 2013. The results from the ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes and ICD-10 hierarchy codes were concordant, and cross-validation with biological test results allowed for validation of the ICD phenotypes. Iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with high TPMT activity (p=0.0004 and p=0.0015, respectively). The study presents an original method for performing PheWAS using both ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results, which can identify new subgroups of patients with different characteristics and allow for personalized clinical and therapeutic management in pharmacogenomics.
This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of stem cells in treating spinal cord injuries in animals. Researchers used data from 156 publications that met certain criteria and used 45 different stem cell preparations. Most of the studies used allogeneic stem cells (from a different individual) rather than autologous stem cells (from the same individual). Overall, allogeneic stem cell treatment appeared to improve both motor and sensory outcomes following spinal cord injuries. However, the extent of this improvement varied depending on the specific type of stem cell used and the method of delivery. For example, implanting stem cells that had differentiated beforehand appeared to lead to better outcomes than implanting undifferentiated stem cells. Similarly, implanting stem cells through an intravenous route appeared to lead to better outcomes than implanting them directly into the spinal cord. Some studies also showed that stem cells could improve sensory outcomes, but this was less consistent than motor outcomes. It is important to note that while this study provides promising evidence for the effectiveness of stem cells in treating spinal cord injuries, more research is needed to determine the optimal type, dose, and delivery method of stem cells for this purpose.
Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura are soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections that affect over 1 billion people worldwide, mainly in developing countries. The most common STHs are A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura, with hookworm being the least prevalent. Infections occur when people come into contact with contaminated soil or eat food contaminated with eggs. These infections often occur in people living in poverty, without proper sanitation, or who don't wash their hands regularly. There is a global strategy to control STH infections, which involves giving anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, such as school-aged children. However, this strategy does not prevent reinfection. In this study, the authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. They found that within three months of treatment, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworm infections reached 26%, 36%, and 30%, respectively, of their pretreatment levels. The prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. The authors suggest that frequent anthelmintic drug administrations are needed to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. They also recommend integrating control approaches emphasizing health education and environmental sanitation to interrupt transmission of STH.
In this study, the authors introduce a new method called Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) to identify deregulated metabolic pathways in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The study uses a mouse and human liver sample expression data to generate alternative metabolic pathways that can produce certain metabolites. The authors found that certain pathways were upregulated in mice but downregulated in humans, and vice versa. They also identified downregulated reactions in the synthesis network for cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and alanine in both humans and mice. Furthermore, they found that the superoxide anion synthesis network was downregulated in humans, specifically in NASH as opposed to steatosis, while it was upregulated in mice. The study demonstrates the versatility of MiNEA as a method that can generate alternative metabolic pathways for any target metabolite and integrate condition- and context-specific omics data to understand the deregulated phenotypes associated with a set of differentially expressed genes. This makes MiNEA a valuable tool for exploring and understanding different metabolic phenotypes.
The olfactory system is responsible for identifying odors, but it can be difficult to distinguish between different odors because there are so many different types of odor molecules. One possible solution is primacy coding, which involves encoding the identity of the odor based on which receptors respond first to the odor. The authors of this paper investigate how well primacy coding works in a simple model by comparing it to other coding schemes. They found that primacy coding works better than other coding schemes for most olfactory tasks. However, the authors also found that receptor sensitivities are important for primacy coding to work well, which suggests that the olfactory system needs to adapt to changing environments to maintain its good performance.
The study aimed to investigate whether certain HIV bnMAbs display unusual virus neutralization profiles, including non-sigmoidal slopes that plateau at <100% neutralization, for a wide range of viruses produced and assayed in both cell lines and primary cells. The study found that all bnMAbs were subject to inhibition curves that did not reach 100%, and most bnMAbs also had neutralization curves with non-sigmoidal slopes. The study also found that bnMAbs targeting certain areas of the trimer were more prone to these effects. Primary isolate and molecular cloned viruses produced in primary cells were also incompletely neutralized, suggesting this phenomenon could be significant in vivo. The results suggest that incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves are possible for all HIV bnMAbs against a wide range of viruses produced and assayed in both cell lines and primary cells, with implications for the use of antibodies in therapy and as tools for vaccine design.
In this paper, the authors propose a new way to understand how cancer cells use glucose and glutamine to grow and divide. They used a mathematical model to simulate different ways in which cancer cells could use these nutrients to produce energy and other molecules they need. They found that the most efficient way for cancer cells to grow is by using a combination of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) and glutamine reductive carboxylation. This process happens only when the available carbon exceeds the amount that can be fully oxidized by the available oxygen, which is a natural condition in the body. The authors then experimentally verified their findings using murine K-ras transformed fibroblasts, which are cells that are commonly used as a model for cancer. Their results show that cancer cells grow best when they use both aerobic glycolysis and glutamine reductive carboxylation, supporting the idea that these two processes are necessary for cancer cell growth.
The article investigates the environment in which PrPC (cellular prion protein) interacts with other molecules. The study used a cell culture model for prion replication and examined the interactome of PrPC, its paralogs Dpl and Sho, as well as the neural cell adhesion molecule, the laminin receptor precursor, Na/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). The study found that there is a similar environment for PrPC, Dpl, and Sho in neuroblastoma cells. In addition, multiple interactions between PrPC and NCAM, LRP, Na/K ATPases, and PDIs were confirmed. The study suggests that PrPC organizes its molecular environment based on its ability to bind to adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin-like domains, which recognize oligomannose-bearing membrane proteins. The article concludes that further research on this topic is needed to better understand the molecular environment of PrPC and its role in prion disease.
The body's natural response to a respiratory virus infection, such as the flu, is to produce a strong type I (pro-inflammatory) immune response. But during respiratory virus infections, the body also produces a type 2 cytokine response, which is linked to asthma exacerbation. In this study, researchers looked at the type 2 cytokine response during influenza virus infection in mice. They found that IL-5, a prototypical type 2 cytokine, was produced in large amounts in the airways of the mice during infection. This IL-5 stimulated the progressive recruitment and accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs, particularly during the recovery phase (after virus clearance). The researchers discovered that the IL-5 was primarily produced by a small number of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) that infiltrated the lungs. Interestingly, the progressive accumulation of eosinophils following virus clearance was reflected in the rapid expansion of ILC2, which had a higher capacity for IL-5 production. The researchers also found that the enhanced capacity for IL-5 production by ILC2 during recovery was concomitant with the enhanced expression of the IL-33 receptor subunit, ST2, by ILC2. The researchers discovered that NKT cells and alveolar macrophages were endogenous sources of IL-33, which enhanced IL-5 production from ILC2. In summary, the researchers found that the accumulation of eosinophils observed during the recovery phase of influenza infection was due to the interaction between ILC2 and IL-33 produced by NKT cells and alveolar macrophages.
This paper describes the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections in an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam. Researchers found that 71% of patients with iNTS were HIV-infected, 71% were adults, 33% reported intravenous drug use, and 28% of patients with a known outcome died. S. Enteritidis (ST11) was the most common serovar found in the hospital, followed by S. Typhimurium (ST19, 34 and 1544). The study concludes that iNTS is a severe infection in Vietnam with a high mortality rate. HIV infection was a risk factor for death.
Phages, the most abundant genetic material in marine environments, can cause disease in humans and other organisms. Scientists are studying phages to better understand their impact on human health. However, phage genomes are diverse and hard to predict using similarity-based annotation methods. To overcome this challenge, the authors designed artificial neural networks that can predict phage and prophage structural proteins. The networks are trained using amino acid frequency and are accurate in predicting structural proteins, including major capsid and tail proteins. The networks are validated using transmission electron microscopy and are found to be accurate. The authors conclude that the networks are valuable tools for identifying phage and prophage structural proteins, which are difficult or impossible to detect by other bioinformatic analysis.
Scientists have discovered that a protein called ORF20, which is produced by a virus called Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), interacts with another protein called OASL. This interaction appears to help the virus to infect cells more efficiently. The protein OASL is an antiviral protein that is produced by the host cells, and it is thought to fight against viruses that try to infect them. However, it turns out that KSHV is able to use OASL to help it to infect cells. The scientists also discovered that ORF20 and OASL are found in the nucleus of infected cells. This suggests that the interaction between these two proteins happens in the nucleus. Overall, the discovery of the interaction between ORF20 and OASL may help scientists to understand how viruses infect cells and how they can be stopped.
The study aimed to determine the prevalence of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. The prevalence of LVD in febrile children was 3.5%, and its prevalence in convulsive children was 2.8%. Vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of LVD. LVD is an important cause of fever, including undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas. Its prevalence and lack of clinical differentiation on presentation underscore the importance of a high index of suspicion in diagnosis.
Scientists have identified a new chemical and genetic factor that can improve the resistance of plants to drought. This factor is a class of butenolide compounds found in smoke, called karrikins (KARs), which promote seed germination under stressful conditions. The scientists found that a gene called KAI2, which encodes the proposed KAR receptor, is important for the drought resistance of Arabidopsis thaliana. They analyzed the physiological and biochemical changes in KAI2-regulated drought resistance, such as increased rates of water loss, drought-induced cell membrane damage, and enlarged stomatal apertures. They also found that KAI2-regulated drought resistance is mediated by a crosstalk with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling, which is a well-known drought-related phytohormone. These findings suggest that chemical or genetic manipulation of KAI2 signaling may provide novel ways to improve drought resistance in plants.
Schistosomiasis is a major health problem worldwide, and bovines, especially water buffaloes, contribute up to 90% of the environmental egg contamination for S. japonicum infection in China. Previous evidence suggests bovines are also important reservoirs of infection in the Philippines. By using recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2 produced using the Drosophila S2 protein expression system, we have shown that human insulin can bind to the L1 subdomain of these two receptors. We have also found that RNA interference knockdown of these receptors in adult worms in vitro significantly reduces their transcription, as well as the transcript levels of other important downstream genes within the insulin pathway associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity. These data suggest that the SjIRs are essential for the growth and fecundity of adult worms and that the L1 subdomain of these receptors could be used as a transmission blocking vaccine candidate to prevent schistosomiasis infection in humans and bovines. We have further shown that rSjLD1/2 could generate a longer period of repression of worm growth and fecundity, suggesting the potential of these receptors as vaccine targets for the control of schistosomiasis.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating disease caused by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti and transmitted by the mosquito Aedes polynesiensis in the South Pacific region. The current global campaign aims to eliminate LF by mass drug administration (MDA), which involves treating the entire population with anti-parasitic drugs to suppress microfilariae levels below the threshold required for transmission. However, the effectiveness of MDA is limited by the biology of the vector mosquito. Aedes polynesiensis displays negative density-dependent transmission, meaning it is more efficient in low-level microfilaraemics, such as those resulting from MDA strategies. A recent study shows that interspecific hybridization and introgression can result in an A. polynesiensis strain that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. The strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays demonstrate that the CP strain is equally competitive with wild type A. polynesiensis, resulting in population elimination when CP males are introduced into wild type A. polynesiensis populations. This study demonstrates the feasibility of a vector elimination strategy using Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts.
This article is about the health and economic burden of sleeping sickness (HAT) in Tanzania. The authors estimate that HAT caused 1.6 million "Disability Adjusted Life Years" (DALYs) in 2005 and was responsible for 50,000 deaths, despite the fact that HAT is a neglected disease. They also estimate that the cost of treating HAT in a district of Tanzania in 2004 was $15,514 and that the cost of the indirect non-medical burden of HAT for the same district in 2004 was $9,781. The authors call for more research to estimate the burden of HAT in different regions of Africa.
The article describes the role of a protein called cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase ( Ngly1 ) in removing N-glycans from misfolded proteins during the process of endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation ( ERAD ). Ngly1 is a highly conserved protein that plays an important role in the efficient degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. The article reports that mice lacking Ngly1 are embryonic lethal and that this can be rescued by deleting the gene for another protein called endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase ( Engase ). The article also reports that a change in the genetic background of mice can partially rescue the lethality of Ngly1-deficient mice. The authors propose that Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice could serve as a valuable animal model for studies related to the pathogenesis of NGLY1-deficiency, and that Engase may represent one of the potential therapeutic targets for this genetic disorder.
In this study, the authors used a mathematical model to investigate how noise is controlled during the expression of the hunchback (hb) gene in early fruit fly (Drosophila) segmentation. The hb gene is activated by the maternal-derived gradient of the Bicoid (Bcd) protein, which forms an anterior-posterior (AP) concentration gradient. The authors found that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter (and their strengths) also play a role in buffering noise. They also found that WT (self-regulatory) Hb output noise is predominantly dependent on the transcription and translation dynamics of its own expression. The authors concluded that particular ways in which promoter structure and regulatory dynamics reduce hb output noise contribute to the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development.
In the article, the authors developed a new method to estimate the strength of selection against Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans. They found that East Asians had slightly higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. The majority of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry was found to be acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. The authors propose that these alleles may have been effectively neutral in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. They found that differences in effective population size may play a more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought.
HIV can establish rare, dormant infections in cells. This study examines how host cell transcription factors affect the activity of the HIV promoter, which controls the expression of the viral genes. The study focuses on two types of transcription factors: NF-κB and Sp1. Using a lentiviral model of the HIV promoter, the researchers found that mutations in the NF-κB or Sp1 binding sites can alter the sensitivity of viral gene expression to stochastic fluctuations in the Tat feedback loop. These mutations also affect the stability of the Bright and Off modes of gene expression. The study has biomedical implications for the treatment of HIV latency, as it may help to identify new targets for therapies that aim to eliminate dormant viral infections.
Orthology refers to the relationship between two genes that have evolved from a common ancestor gene. There are many ways to infer orthologs, and the quality of these inferences can be evaluated using different tests. One commonly used method to assign orthologs is the use of species trees, which can be inferred from gene trees. This method has the advantage that it can incorporate more information about the evolutionary history of the species under study. However, it also has some limitations, such as the need for well-annotated genes. Another method is the use of a reference tree, which is a simplified version of a species tree. This method is easy to use but can lead to incorrect inferences. Other methods include the use of gene trees, gene expression data, and protein sequence information. When evaluating ortholog inference methods, it is important to consider the type of data used, the accuracy of the predictions, and the scalability of the method.
The article presents a novel drug repurposing pipeline for the development of new treatments for schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide. The pipeline involves using computational methods to identify potential drug targets based on known drug-target interactions in other organisms, and then using these targets to screen libraries of approved drugs to find those that are effective against the parasite. The study focuses on the three species of the genus Schistosoma that infect humans, and identifies 22 novel potential targets and 20 approved drugs that could be repurposed to treat schistosomiasis. The primary targets are CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, and MEK1, and secondary targets are ABL, ERBB4, and EGFR. These targets are important for maintaining the parasite's lifecycle, and the study suggests that the repurposed drugs could be effective against all three stages of the parasite's lifecycle. The study also provides information on the kinomes of the three species of Schistosoma that infect humans, which is important for understanding the parasite's biology and developing new treatments. Overall, the study provides a promising approach for the development of new treatments for schistosomiasis and highlights the importance of drug repurposing as a way to discover new treatments for neglected diseases.
The study presents a computational model for the coupled folding and binding of the CREB transcription factor to its co-activator CBP. The authors use a Gō-type topology-based model and a Bayesian formula to analyze the transition states of the binding process, focusing on the role of the helical structure of pKID. The study finds that the binding transition state is similar to the unbound state, with the αB helix remaining mostly unstructured. The authors also find that increasing the helical propensity of the unbound pKID decreases the binding rate constant, contrary to previous studies suggesting that a pre-folded conformation is required for binding. The study provides a detailed picture of the binding mechanism of pKID to KIX, including the formation of a hydrophobic interface and the involvement of a transient state with non-native interactions.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by blood-dwelling worms. The parasites can infect humans and cause serious health problems. The disease is most common in children and can affect their growth, learning, and physical and mental health. Schistosomiasis is a major public health issue in Latin America and the Caribbean, and many people are infected with the parasite. To address this issue, researchers conducted a study to analyze the prevalence and intensity of infection with the parasite in children across the region. The researchers found that the highest prevalence and intensity of infection occurs in Brazil. However, some other countries, such as Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia, also need to update their epidemiological status to re-design their national programs and target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. The study also found that heterogeneity in the methodologies used for monitoring and evaluating the progress of the schistosomiasis programs made it difficult to compare data across countries. The researchers recommend improving reporting and standardizing the monitoring and evaluation methodologies used to address the regional elimination goal. The study also found that improving epidemiological data by age group and sex would be helpful for developing effective public health interventions.
HIV-1 is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids. The transmission of HIV-1 is highly restricted and occurs when a single virus variant, called a transmitted/founder (TF) virus, is selected from all the different variants present in the infected transmitting partner. This selection is not random, and it has been observed that certain properties of the TF virus, such as its envelope glycoprotein, are different from those of other variants. Studies have suggested that the selection of TF viruses may be due to their ability to evade the host’s immune system. However, recent research has demonstrated that the replicative capacity of TF viruses in cell cultures is not different from that of non-transmitted viruses. These results suggest that other factors, such as host immunity and other unknown mechanisms, may play a role in determining which viruses are transmitted.
In this study, the authors wanted to know more about how lymphatic filariasis causes lymphatic damage and how it can be prevented. To do this, they exposed human lymphatic endothelial cells to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected patient serum. They found that these exposures caused the cells to proliferate and differentiate into tube-like structures. The authors also found that parasites caused changes in the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development, which decreased the ability of the lymphatic vessels to transport substances. These findings suggest that the parasite itself is causing lymphatic damage, rather than the immune response. The authors also found that the parasites caused an increase in matrix metalloproteases, which are enzymes that break down proteins in the extracellular matrix. The authors believe that this could be a possible cause of lymphatic damage. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms behind lymphatic damage caused by lymphatic filariasis.
In this article, the authors describe a new method for amplifying the genomes of single bacteria using microfluidic devices. By reducing the volume of the reaction from 50 microliters to 60 nanoliters, the authors were able to increase the specificity and coverage of the amplification. They also demonstrated that the specificity and coverage of the amplification can be further improved by using emulsion PCR to further enrich the sample. The authors conclude that this new method has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of microbial ecology and evolution by allowing us to study the genomes of unculturable organisms.
Hantaviruses are viruses that can cause a potentially fatal illness called hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in humans. They are carried by a variety of rodent species in South America, including the black-footed pygmy rice rat and the hairy-tailed bolo mouse. The distribution of these rodents can be influenced by various factors, including landscape structure, land use change, climate, and biodiversity patterns. To understand how hantavirus host distributions are affected by these factors, we used geographically weighted regression models and found that host distribution was positively influenced by landscape diversity and negatively by native forest cover. We also found that human vulnerability to hantavirus infection was positively correlated with the proportion of hantavirus host rodents in a given area. This suggests that surveillance efforts for hantavirus infections should be reinforced in areas with higher predicted hantavirus host proportions and vulnerability to hantavirus infection. It is important to note that this is a preliminary study and more research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between hantavirus hosts and their environments.
The research examined the role of proteins called BCL2 in the death of cells infected with flaviviruses, which are viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. In this study, the researchers looked at three types of BCL2 proteins: BH3-only proteins, BAX/BAK proteins, and pro-survival proteins. They found that pro-survival proteins, particularly BCLXL, are crucial for the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses. The researchers also found that the survival of infected cells depends on BCLXL due to the suppression of another pro-survival protein called MCL1. When BCLXL is inhibited, BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis occurs. This study highlights the important role of BCLXL in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses and suggests that BCLXL may be a potential target for antiviral therapy against these viruses.
Canine rabies is a big problem in Asia and Vietnam. It causes many human deaths and leads to high costs for treating people who have been bitten by rabid animals. This study looked at the economic impact of canine rabies in Vietnam over a 10-year period. The results showed that the total economic impact of canine rabies was over $719 million USD. The largest portion of the costs came from the treatment of people who had been bitten by rabid animals. This study found that the impact of canine rabies in Vietnam is similar to what is seen in other Asian countries. The study also found that there are many ways in which canine rabies can have economic impacts, such as through vaccinations and treatment of livestock. Overall, this study suggests that it is important to take steps to prevent and control canine rabies in Vietnam, as it is having a significant economic impact.
Scientists have discovered that there are at least three different types of Type II Secretion Systems (T2SS) in bacteria. These systems are responsible for secreting proteins through the bacterial outer membrane. Each type of T2SS has a different structure and function. Researchers have determined the structure of a new type of pilotin, called AspS, which is found in the Vibrio-type T2SS. They have also identified a new secretin, called GspD, which uses AspS to transport it to the outer membrane. This finding is important because it helps us understand how different types of T2SS function in different types of bacteria.
Leptospirosis is a disease caused by pathogenic bacteria (Leptospira spp.) that is spread to humans through contact with infected animals or contaminated water. The bacteria can bind to human skin elastin and other cell surface and extracellular matrix proteins, which is important for their survival and pathogenesis. In this study, the authors investigated the binding of three outer membrane proteins (OmpL36, OmpL37, and OmpL47) from a pathogenic Leptospira strain to host tissue components. They found that OmpL37 binds to human skin elastin specifically, with a high affinity. OmpL37 also binds to aortic elastin, fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, and plasma fibronectin, but to a lesser extent than to human skin elastin. They also found that rabbit antiserum for OmpL37 enhances the binding of the pathogenic bacteria to human skin elastin, suggesting that OmpL37 plays a role in the adherence of the bacteria to the host. The authors concluded that OmpL37 is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptospira that may promote the attachment of the bacteria to elastin-rich tissues.
Scientists have identified antibodies that can stop the virus that causes AIDS from infecting cells. These antibodies target a region of the virus that is exposed briefly during the early stages of infection. The authors developed a mathematical model to explain how these antibodies work and how they can be used to treat HIV infections. They found that the antibodies are most effective when they bind to the virus quickly and remain bound for at least five minutes. They also found that the antibodies are more effective when they bind to the virus in a way that causes the virus to change shape, making it more difficult for the virus to infect cells. The authors suggest that this type of antibody could be used to treat HIV infections.
Ivermectin is a medicine that is used to control onchocerciasis, a skin disease caused by worms. The medicine is given to people in areas where the disease is common. Researchers wanted to know if the medicine could also stop the spread of the disease in Africa, where the worms can spread very quickly. They did a study in three areas of Mali and Senegal where people had been taking the medicine for 15 to 17 years. They found that the number of people with the disease had decreased and that the worms were no longer spreading in those areas. The researchers then stopped giving the medicine to people in one of the areas to see if the disease would come back. After three more years, the disease had not come back. This means that the medicine can be used to stop the spread of the disease in some areas of Africa.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge have discovered a new way that the common cold virus, human rhinovirus (HRV), enters human cells. HRV is a type of virus called picornavirus that causes respiratory infections. To infect cells, the virus must be able to enter the cell's interior. However, since HRV is not surrounded by a membrane, it cannot fuse with the cell's membrane like enveloped viruses. Instead, HRV must use a different strategy to enter cells.
The study aimed to identify the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lipid A, a biologically active component of Gram-negative bacteria, in the bacteria Francisella tularensis, which causes the disease tularemia in humans. The researchers screened mutant strains of Francisella novicida (Ft), a less virulent subspecies that causes severe disease in mice, for mutations that affected the biosynthesis of lipid A. Three enzymes, FlmF1, FlmF2, and FlmK, were identified as required for lipid A carbohydrate modifications. These mutants were attenuated in mice after subcutaneous and pulmonary infection, and they provided protection against a lethal infection with the wild-type strain. Additionally, the FlmK mutant stimulated an increased innate immune response compared to the wild-type strain and other bacterial lipid A biosynthetic mutants, which appears to involve the MyD88 signaling pathway. Overall, the study shows attenuation of virulence and the induction of protective immunity in both subcutaneous and pulmonary routes of infection by Ft mutants with altered lipid A.
A new study has investigated the role of a protein called Era, which helps build ribosomes, in the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Previous research has shown that Era is important for ribosome assembly in E. coli, a common laboratory bacterium. The study found that Era is not essential for growth in S. aureus, but that it is important for 30S subunit assembly. It also found that Era interacts with two other proteins that help build ribosomes, YbeY and CshA. These findings suggest that Era helps coordinate the actions of several proteins involved in ribosome assembly. The study also found that Era interacts with the enzyme that makes the molecule ppGpp, which is made when cells are under stress. This suggests that Era may help manage the response to stress by coordinating the actions of proteins involved in ribosome assembly.
The study found that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) deficiency in mice makes them more sensitive to anthrax toxin, while deficiencies in the other two NOS enzymes (iNOS and eNOS) have no effect on toxin-mediated mortality. The study also showed that the heart is an early target of anthrax toxin in mice and that nNOS may protect the heart from LT-mediated damage. The study also found that the potent nitric oxide scavenger, carboxy-PTIO, showed some protective effect against anthrax toxin.
The paper is about a new way to study parasitic worms, which cause disease in humans and animals, called nematodes. This method is called CRISPR-Cas9 gene targeting and it involves cutting specific parts of the worm's DNA using special molecules called CRISPR-Cas9. This is a powerful tool that can be used to study the function of specific genes in these worms. The paper describes how this method was successfully used to target a specific gene in a parasitic worm called Strongyloides stercoralis. The results show that the method works well and that it can be used to study the function of genes in these worms. This may help scientists understand how these worms cause disease and may lead to new ways to treat or prevent infections caused by these worms.
This study introduces a mathematical model that describes the effects of ribosome drop-off, which occurs when a ribosome prematurely terminates translation at a non-stop codon. The model takes into account the drop-off rate and predicts the effects on the density of ribosomes along the mRNA and the associated protein synthesis rate. The results show that ribosome drop-off can lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, with a potentially increasing density from the 5' to the 3' end of the mRNA. Importantly, the model predicts that the effects of ribosome drop-off on the translation rate are mRNA-specific, and that mRNAs with ribosome queues are more resilient to drop-off than those without. The model can be used to analyze variations in the translational efficiency of individual mRNAs by accounting for the full range of known ribosome behaviors, as well as explaining mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies.
A new study investigates if criteria to determine whether interruption of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) transmission is unlikely can be defined at earlier timepoints. The study uses an individual-based stochastic model to simulate the core aspects of the DeWorm3 community-based cluster-randomized trial. The trial aims to test whether transmission interruption can be achieved using mass drug administration (MDA) alone. The study finds that all clusters should be assessed for transmission interruption after two years of surveillance, unless there is evidence of low treatment coverage. Models suggest a tight range of homogenous prevalence estimates following high coverage MDA across clusters which do not allow for discrimination between bounce-back or transmission interruption within 24 months following cessation of MDA. This means that it is not possible to determine whether interruption of transmission has been successful at early stages of the trial. Therefore, researchers recommend that criteria for determining whether transmission interruption is unlikely should not be defined until at least 18-24 months after the last round of MDA.
Cholera is a dangerous disease caused by the bacteria Vibrio cholerae. There are two main types of this bacteria: Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139. In this study, the authors tested a new vaccine that is made from a specific sugar found in Vibrio cholerae O1 bacteria. They tested the vaccine in mice and found that it was immunogenic, meaning it could protect mice from getting cholera if they were exposed to it later. The vaccine is made by attaching the specific sugar to a protein from another bacteria, which makes it easier for the human immune system to recognize and fight off. This could be an important step towards creating a vaccine for cholera that would be effective in humans as well.
The article describes a study that looked at how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus Candida albicans, two microorganisms that often infect humans, interact with each other in the gut. The researchers used a special mouse model to study this interaction and found that C. albicans inhibits the virulence (ability to cause disease) of P. aeruginosa by suppressing the expression of genes that are important for P. aeruginosa's ability to acquire iron. The researchers also found that this interaction does not affect the ability of P. aeruginosa to colonize the gut, but it does decrease its ability to harm gut cells. The researchers conclude that this interaction could have important implications for the development of new strategies for preventing invasive microbial infections.
Escape mutant viruses, which evade recognition by the immune system, are often less fit than the original wild-type viruses. The rate and timing of reversion from escape mutant to wild-type viruses can vary depending on the size and diversity of the initial inoculum and other factors. A study in pigtail macaques found that rapid reversion to wild-type occurred following infection with a mixture of escape mutant and wild-type virus containing at least 10% wild-type virus. In contrast, a delayed reversion pattern was observed when the inoculum contained much smaller proportions of wild-type virus or a pure escape mutant virus. The study suggests that delayed reversion to wild-type virus may lead to lower viral loads. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding the dynamics of reversion for developing new strategies to control HIV infection.
The study describes the identification of cadmium-resistant yeast strains in the Evolution Canyon ecosystem at Nahal Oren, Israel. The strains were shown to have mutations in the PCA1 gene, which encodes a P-type ATPase responsible for cadmium export. The study also provides evidence that the cadmium resistance in these strains was acquired through natural selection in a specific environment, and that the PCA1 allele responsible for the resistance has been passed down to most modern S. cerevisiae strains.
The authors of this study wanted to understand the relationship between the deregulation of different pathways and patient survival in gastric cancer (GC). They used gene expression signatures to identify major oncogenic pathways that are deregulated in GC. They also validated these pathway predictions in vitro using a panel of GC cell lines and found that patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple independent patient cohorts. The authors conclude that GCs can be taxonomized using oncogenic pathway activity into biologically, functionally, and clinically relevant subtypes, which will help in the development of more effective treatment strategies for GC.
DNA is not only a carrier of genetic information, but it can also play an active role in biological processes. One of its functions is to regulate gene expression. In vivo, DNA superhelicity is tightly controlled by a variety of processes. It can vary between growth and stationary phases according to the energy charge of the cell. Transcription of one gene can affect the expression of neighboring genes through transcription-induced changes of superhelicity. In particular, the destabilization experienced in an intergenic region separating divergently oriented genes can increase drastically when either or both genes are actively being transcribed. In this work, the authors use a computational method called SIDD (stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization) analysis to predict sites that are susceptible to strand separation under negative superhelical stress. They calculate the SIDD profile of the entire E. coli K12 genome and report that strong SIDD sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions that are either known or inferred to contain promoters. They also find that the upstream regions of genes in certain functional families, such as transcriptional regulators, are more destabilized than other functional families. These results suggest that strong SIDD sites are involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes. The authors propose that these SIDD sites are active and necessary participants in superhelically mediated regulatory mechanisms governing changes in the global pattern of gene expression in response to physiological or environmental changes.
The study investigates the role of high-mobility group ( HMG ) box proteins in the sexual cycle of Podospora anserina, a filamentous fungus. The fungus has 12 HMG-box genes, four of which have been previously characterized. These include three mating-type genes that control fertilization and development of the fruit-body, and one gene that encodes a mitochondrion-targeted protein. The remaining eight uncharacterized HMG-box genes were deleted and the phenotypes of the mutant strains were assessed. The results showed that all genes were dispensable for viability. However, six mutant strains displayed sexual reproduction defects, and one displayed vegetative defects. Transcriptional analysis revealed that an ortholog of SpSte11 is at the hub of the HMG-box gene network and regulates the expression of mating-type genes and fertility.
The 2013–2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa was the largest ever recorded, with over 28,000 confirmed cases and 11,000 survivors. Prior to the outbreak, there was limited information on how long the virus can survive in survivors' body fluids and the risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. As a result, guidelines recommended abstinence or condom use for 3 months after discharge. However, there was concern about the risk of transmission from survivors' semen or other body fluids. An observational cohort study was implemented during the EVD epidemic response operation in Sierra Leone to determine the persistence of the virus in survivors' body fluids. The challenges encountered during implementation included the unforeseen duration of follow-up, the complexity of interpreting and communicating laboratory results, and the urgency of translating the research findings into public health practice. Strong community engagement helped to quickly implement the study during the epidemic. The study was conducted in two phases and assessed the persistence of the virus in semen and other body fluids of 100 men and 120 women. The study results provided critical evidence to prioritize the development of semen testing programs and informed national and global guidelines.
The paper focuses on understanding the chemical gradients that bacteria, specifically E. coli, encounter in their natural environment. To do this, the authors use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments and mathematical models of information theory. They show that E. coli senses chemical gradients in the intestine and adjusts its swimming behavior accordingly to maximize the information it receives about the chemical environment it is in. This work provides a new way of understanding how bacterial sensory systems work and could help us better understand how microorganisms sense and adapt to their environment.
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for generating all types of blood cells throughout our lives. Because of their self-renewal ability, it was initially thought that HSCs were immortal. However, evidence has shown that HSCs have a finite lifespan, and that this lifespan is determined on the level of individual HSCs. The reliability theory suggests that HSCs with longer lifespans have higher repair capacity. Using clonal repopulation experiments and computational-mathematical modeling, researchers have found that the failure kinetics of each HSC are largely anti-persistent or mean-reverting processes, and that the repair capacity of HSCs is self-limiting.
This study shows that antibodies are essential for protecting against a type of roundworm infection in mice. The researchers found that antibodies help to trap the worm larvae and prevent tissue damage. They also showed that antibodies can activate macrophages in a different way than has been seen before. These macrophages help to kill the worms and also help with tissue healing. The researchers also found that this type of macrophage activation does not require a special type of receptor that is activated by a hormone called IL-4.
A new method has been developed to visualize and analyze the resection of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in living yeast cells. The method uses protein oligomerization rather than operator multiplicity to form visible foci, allowing for real-time analysis of the dynamics and mechanism of resection. The study has revealed that the damaged chromatin region is confined during the very early steps of resection, which is consistent with the need to keep DNA ends in contact. The method will be widely applicable for fine-scale analysis of genome organization, dynamics, and function in normal and pathological contexts.
Chagas disease is a vector-borne disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Reinfection by T. cruzi is possible in humans and animals, leading to a lower or even hardly detectable parasitaemia. There are limited data on the frequency and timing of parasite re-inoculation in the course of the disease. In this study, stochastic agent-based models are developed to estimate the rate of re-inoculation in humans and to assess how frequent are reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease, according to different hypotheses on the adaptive immune response following a primary infection. The models are fitted to epidemiological data from an Argentinean rural village where mixed infections by different genotypes of T. cruzi reach 56% in humans. The results show that the risk of reinfection during the typically long chronic stage of the disease stands around 14% (4%-18%) and 60% (21%-70%) after 5 and 30 years, respectively. With these low rates, the risks of reinfection during the chronic stage are low, and most individuals are re-infected 1-3 times overall. These estimates are of particular interest for vaccine development and our understanding of the higher risk of chronic disease manifestations suffered by infected people living in endemic areas.
Dengue is a common tropical disease that can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe. While many cases of dengue are asymptomatic or cause only mild symptoms, some people can develop severe dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, or dengue shock syndrome. Researchers are trying to understand why some people develop severe dengue and others do not. In this study, the authors looked at the immune response of children in Thailand before and after they were exposed to dengue virus. They found that the immune response of the children who developed severe dengue was different from those who developed mild or no symptoms. Specifically, they found that the immune response of the children who developed severe dengue was characterized by higher levels of some cytokines and lower levels of others. These findings could help researchers understand how to predict whether someone will develop severe dengue and how to develop better treatments for the disease.
This study investigates how a molecule called Hedgehog (Hh) controls patterning during the development of a butterfly wing. The study shows that Hh molecules form a gradient in a part of the wing called the anterior compartment, and this gradient controls the expression of different genes. However, it is not clear how the different gene expression patterns correspond to different levels of Hh. This study uses a mathematical model to propose a new explanation for how Hh works. The model suggests that the Hh gradient is insufficient to determine more than two gene expression patterns in a concentration-dependent manner. The study provides evidence that Hh-dependent pattern formation depends on a transient expansion of the Hh gradient caused by the Hh-dependent up-regulation of a protein called Patched (Ptc). This study provides a new model of how Hh controls patterning during the development of a butterfly wing.
Scientists have discovered a new mouse mutation that affects the way the nervous system responds to alcohol and anesthetics. The mutation was found in a genetic screen of mice with enhanced locomotor activity. The mutation disrupts the homolog of a protein found in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Both the mutated mice and worms are hypersensitive to ethanol and have altered responses to anesthetics. The mutation also affects the way the mice respond to new environments, food, and ethanol. Interestingly, the mutated mice voluntarily drink more ethanol than normal mice. These findings suggest that a conserved pathway might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans.
Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite called Plasmodium, which is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Researchers have identified the Imd pathway as a potential source of anti-Plasmodium genes and mechanisms that could be exploited to control the malaria transmission cycle. Silencing the expression of the gene caspar, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, or over-expressing the gene rel2, an Imd pathway-controlled NFkappaB transcription factor, confers a resistant phenotype on mosquitoes that involves an array of immune effector genes. However, unexplored features of this powerful mechanism that may be essential for the implementation of a malaria control strategy still remain. Using RNA interference to singly or dually silence caspar and other components of the Imd pathway, researchers have identified genes participating in the anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar, each of which represents a potential target to achieve over-activation of the pathway. They also determined that the Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, yet also has reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts. Researchers further demonstrated that caspar silencing alone is sufficient to induce a robust anti-P . falciparum response even in the relative absence of resident gut microbiota. Finally, they established the relevance of the Imd pathway components and regulated effectors TEP1 , APL1 , and LRIM1 in parasite infection intensity-dependent defense, thereby shedding light on the relevance of laboratory versus natural infection intensity models. Their results highlight the physiological considerations that are integral to a thoughtful implementation of Imd pathway manipulation in mosquitoes as part of an effort to limit the malaria transmission cycle, and they reveal a variety of previously unrecognized nuances in the Imd-directed immune response against P . falciparum.
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been studied for their potential use in treating fibrotic diseases. These cells can modulate the immune response and promote tissue repair. In this study, researchers examined whether BMMSCs can be used to treat pulmonary fibrosis caused by a fungal infection. They used mice infected with the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis to study the effect of BMMSCs on pulmonary fibrosis. The results showed that the late infusion of BMMSCs did not have any anti-fibrotic effect and instead promoted collagen expression and tissue remodeling. This suggests that BMMSCs may not be an effective therapy for pulmonary fibrosis caused by this fungal infection. The researchers also found that the combination therapy of BMMSCs and a drug called itraconazole, which is used to treat the fungal infection, may be effective in treating pulmonary fibrosis. This highlights the importance of considering different treatment strategies when trying to treat fibrotic diseases.
This article summarizes the results of a study that aimed to understand the seasonal dynamics of Phlebotomine sand flies, vectors of the Leishmania parasite that causes leishmaniasis, in the Mediterranean subregion. Previous studies have shown that climate change has led to the expansion of Phlebotomine sand flies to higher latitudes and altitudes. This study used data from sand fly collections made in eight countries across the Mediterranean subregion, using a common protocol that included monthly captures by CDC light traps and sticky traps in most of the sites. Collections were replicated for more than one season in order to reduce the effects of local weather events and inter-seasonal comparisons were made to understand the seasonal dynamics of sand flies. The study found that the time of sand fly appearance and disappearance differed between sites, and seasonal densities showed variations in each site. Adult sand flies ended their activity in mid September through November without significant correlation with latitude/mean annual temperature of sites. The study also identified a common pattern of nocturnal females activity that peaked between 11 pm and 2 am. The period of potential exposure to L. infantum in the Mediterranean subregion was associated to a regular bell-shaped density curve having a wide peak center encompassing the July-September period, and falling between early May to late October for more than 99% of values. The study found that the risk for L. infantum transmission in the Mediterranean was not equally distributed throughout the region, since density waves of adults occurred earlier and were more frequent in southern territories. The study also identified a dozen of Phlebotomus species that have been implicated in the transmission of Mediterranean L. infantum, of which eight have been incriminated as vectors according to conventional criteria. The study used data from more than 99000 collected specimens, resulting in the description of seasonal dynamics of about 56000 sand flies belonging to species competent to transmit L. infantum throughout a wide geographical range. This study provides valuable information on the seasonal dynamics of Phlebotomine sand flies in the Mediterranean subregion, which is important for understanding changes that may have an impact on leishmaniasis transmission.
The bacteria Orientia tsutsugamushi causes scrub typhus, a serious illness that is common in the Asia-Pacific region. This study looked at how the bacteria interact with human monocytes. It found that O. tsutsugamushi can infect and replicate within monocytes, and it can change the way these cells behave. The bacteria also caused some monocytes to die. The study also found that O. tsutsugamushi can change the way that genes are expressed in monocytes. These gene expression changes were related to what happens in people who have scrub typhus. The study found that the bacteria change the way that monocytes behave, and that these changes are similar to what happens in people who have scrub typhus.
This study is about ants' ability to remember routes and use them to navigate back to their nest. Scientists have developed a model of a circuit in the ant's brain that helps them learn and remember these routes. This model has been able to replicate many features of the ants' route-following behavior, and it has been shown to work well in simulations. This research could help scientists understand how animals use their brains to navigate and remember complex environments.
This study presents a new system for studying the defense mechanism in cauline leaves of Arabidopsis triggered by bacterial infection. The authors found that cauline leaves infected with Pseudomonas syringae abscise as a defense mechanism. The study found that the abscission response is robust and can be triggered by bacteria causing either disease or ETI (effector-triggered immunity). The authors also found that the defense hormone salicylic acid (SA) likely regulates leaf shedding since a number of genes necessary for SA-mediated defense are also necessary for the full leaf shedding defense response. The authors conclude that leaf abscission is a bona fide defense mechanism against bacterial infection.
The ability to detect and understand the direction of image motion is important for the visual system to detect moving objects and predict their trajectories. This function is achieved by starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which are retinal cells that generate larger Ca2+ signals in their dendrites when motion is from their somata towards their dendritic tips than for motion in the opposite direction. Using two-photon microscopy, whole-cell recordings, and compartmental modeling, we found that dendritic direction selectivity (DS) in SACs can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, which provides the spatial asymmetry necessary for direction discrimination.
The paper is about the relationship between how pathogens enter the host, how many cells are needed to start an infection, and how virulent the pathogens are. The authors found that pathogens that enter the host through wounds require fewer cells to start an infection than pathogens that enter through the mouth or nose. The authors also found that pathogens that act on the host from a distance require more cells to start an infection than pathogens that act directly on the host. The authors suggest that this is because pathogens that act from a distance need to release more molecules to overwhelm the host's immune system, so they need more cells. The authors also found that pathogens that act from a distance are not more virulent than pathogens that act directly on the host. The authors suggest that this is because the actual dose of pathogen in natural infections is largely determined by factors such as mode of transmission, and so does not show a strong covariance with whether a parasite acts locally or globally within the host. The authors suggest that all three explanations could play a role, with their importance varying across species.
This study used the bioinformatics tool Sylamer to analyze the 3’-UTRs of transcripts differentially expressed between juvenile and adult schistosome worms. They found that sma-miR-277/4989 is the only miRNA target sequence significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. Further analysis revealed that this miRNA forms a cluster with sma-miR-277 and they described a novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989, and hairpin folds for both miRNAs that are compatible with the miRNA pathway. The authors also found that expression of sma-miR-277/4989 is up-regulated in adults, while their predicted targets are characterised by significant down-regulation in paired adult worms. Additionally, sma-miR-4989 is expressed in tegumental cells located proximal to the oesophagus gland and is distributed throughout the male worm’s body. Overall, these findings suggest that sma-miR-277/4989 might play a dominant role in post-transcriptional regulation during development of juvenile worms and an important role in the sexual development of female schistosomes.
SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) is a serious human disease that emerged in 2002 and caused a global pandemic in 2003. The disease is caused by the virus SARS-CoV, which belongs to the Betacoronavirus family and shares a similar genome structure with other coronaviruses. However, it has unique features that make it distinct from other coronaviruses. It contains accessory genes, including ORF3, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8a, ORF8b, and ORF9b. Horseshoe bats are considered the likely source of SARS-CoV. Masked palm civets were initially suspected as the animal origin of SARS-CoV. However, after the emergence of SARS, a large number of genetically diverse SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) were detected in horseshoe bats in China and Europe. Recent studies have identified four novel SARSr-CoVs in Chinese horseshoe bats that shared much higher genomic sequence similarity to the epidemic strains, particularly in the S gene, of which two strains (WIV1 and WIV16) have been successfully cultured in vitro. These newly identified SARSr-CoVs have been demonstrated to use the same cellular receptor (ACE-2) as SARS-CoV does and replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells. Despite this cumulative evidence for the emergence of SARS-CoV from bats, all bat SARSr-CoVs described so far are clearly distinct from SARS-CoV in the S gene and/or one or more accessory genes such as ORF3 and ORF8. This study provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.
The article discusses the issue of drug resistance in soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), including Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworms (Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale). The article suggests that the density-dependent fecundity of STHs can affect the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT), which measures the number of eggs before and after drug treatment to estimate drug efficacy. The article also discusses the recent study by Kopp et al. (2014), which showed a poor relationship between drug efficacy and epg (eggs per gram of faeces) in dogs infected with Ancylostoma caninum. The article suggests that the increase in egg production in surviving adult female worms after drug treatment is due to the relaxation of density-dependent constraints on egg production, and that this phenomenon may lead to an underestimation of drug efficacy in the FECRT. The article recommends the use of in vitro phenotypic assays or molecular tests to detect resistance in STH infections in humans.
Lung growth is a complex process that involves many factors. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a kind of glycosaminoglycan that is important for many biological processes, including lung development. In this study, the authors showed that deleting HS synthetase (Ext1) in mouse lung epithelium led to branching defects. Specifically, the lung branches were overgrown and there were fewer branches. The authors also found that SHH signaling, which is important for lung development, was reduced in the mutant lung epithelium. They also found that the amount of active SHH protein in the mutant lung epithelium was reduced. This study suggests that HS is important for lung development by regulating SHH signaling.
The authors present a study on the use of paired-end sequencing to detect fusion genes in cancer genomes. They first develop a formula for the probability of a fusion gene existing in a cancer genome given a collection of paired-end sequences from the genome. They then use this formula to compute fusion gene probabilities in several breast cancer samples and find that they are able to accurately predict fusion genes in these samples with a relatively small number of fragments of large size. They also evaluate how the ability to detect fusion genes depends on the distribution of gene lengths and different parameters of a sequencing strategy. These results will be useful in calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, particularly large-scale studies of many cancer genomes that are enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies.
Chemotion is a process that allows cells to sense and move towards chemical gradients. Researchers have found that this process involves three separate but interrelated processes: motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. These processes can be described using mathematical models, and simulations of these models show that cells can migrate and change shape in response to chemical gradients. The mathematical models also suggest that chemotion involves an excitable network that responds to chemical stimuli, and that this excitable network is linked to the cytoskeleton, which allows cells to maintain their shape and move in a persistent manner. By varying the strengths of different feedback loops in the model, researchers can create cellular behaviors that mimic those of genetically altered cells.
The article presents the results of a study on a protein called Tudor domain-containing protein 6 (TDRD6) and its role in splicing during meiosis in male mice. The study showed that TDRD6 interacts with arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, which supports splicing. TDRD6 also associates with a spliceosomal protein called SmB, which happens in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. In the absence of TDRD6, the association of PRMT5 with SmB and arginine dimethylation of SmB are much reduced. The study also found that TDRD6 deficiency impairs the assembly of spliceosomes, resulting in increased levels of U5 snRNPs in the nucleus. The study's findings suggest that TDRD6 plays an important role in the regulation of spliceosome assembly and mRNA splicing in meiotic prophase I spermatocytes.
This paper presents a new method for understanding how bacteria colonize and clear from the bodies of humans. This method uses genetic information from bacteria samples collected over time to determine whether two bacterial strains are the same or not. This information can help researchers understand how long bacteria stay in the body, whether they are cleared or recolonized, and whether the recolonized bacteria are the same or not. This method is particularly useful for studying bacteria that can cause infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because it can help researchers understand how to best treat and prevent these infections from spreading. The method is based on a statistical model that uses genetic information to determine the probability that two bacteria samples are the same strain. This model takes into account the within-host variation of bacteria, which is important for understanding how bacteria evolve and adapt over time. The method is demonstrated using a large collection of MRSA genomes collected over time from a clinical trial. Overall, this method provides a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of bacterial colonization in humans, which can inform the development of more effective strategies for treating and preventing bacterial infections.
Auxin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the growth and development of plants. It is transported throughout the plant from cell to cell by carriers located at the cell plasma membrane. When auxin is transported out of a cell, it creates a gradient of auxin concentrations between cells. This gradient is sensed by cells and affects the growth and development of the plant. There are two main hypotheses for how auxin gradients are established: canalization and concentration-based polarization. Canalization refers to the idea that PIN carriers in the membrane are reoriented by the auxin gradient, leading to the amplification of the gradient. Concentration-based polarization refers to the idea that PIN carriers in the membrane are reoriented by the gradient of auxin concentrations between cells, leading to the amplification of the gradient. Recent studies have shown that both canalization and concentration-based polarization play a role in the growth and development of plants.
Researchers developed a new diagnostic test for a parasite that causes kala-azar, also known as visceral leishmaniasis. This test uses specific proteins identified from the parasite's genome sequence and the proteins' ability to bind to human antibodies. The researchers used mass spectrometry to identify proteins from the parasite, and then used in silico algorithms to predict which parts of the proteins were likely to be recognized by human antibodies. They then synthesized peptides of the identified regions and tested them in a prototype diagnostic test, which showed promising results in a small sample size. The researchers propose that this approach is a proof of concept for discovering diagnostic peptides that can be used to improve current diagnostic tests for visceral leishmaniasis.
The study aims to determine the prevalence of caseating granulomas in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), a parasitic skin disease caused by Leishmania parasites. The study included 317 patients with CL from six countries: Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Iran. The study found that caseating granulomas were present in 195 (61.5%) of the patients. The results of the study indicate that caseating granulomas are not uncommon in CL and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cases with such granulomas, especially in areas endemic for both TB and CL. The study also suggests that the healing process may be slower in cases with caseating granulomas, although the reason for this is not clear.
In this study, the authors have identified a gene on chromosome 4 that may be causing diabetes in mice carrying the SJL strain. The gene, called Zfp69, is involved in the development of adipose tissue and was found to be disrupted by a retrotransposon in the NZO and C57BL/6J strains. This disruption led to the formation of a truncated mRNA that lacked the coding sequence for the KRAB and Znf-C2H2 domains of Zfp69. The authors found that the diabetogenic allele of Zfp69 in the SJL strain generated a normal mRNA and caused hyperglycemia in mice when combined with the B6.V-Lepob background. The authors concluded that Zfp69 is the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL.
The paper presents an integrated model for the regulation of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cell differentiation. Using logical analysis, the model identifies stable states corresponding to canonical Th subtypes, but also finds hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg, and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. This highlights the complexity of Th cell differentiation and the importance of considering the effects of heterogeneous environments on differentiation.
The authors present a thermodynamic model of transcription factor binding to investigate the forces that determine where, when, and to what extent transcription factors bind in the genome. The model uses in vivo binding data and DNA affinities to make predictions. They show that, in regions of open chromatin, DNA sequence specificity of individual factors is the major determinant of binding. They suggest that combining chromatin accessibility data with simple computational models of transcription factor binding may allow for precise prediction of binding patterns of any animal transcription factor.
In this paper, the authors study how two proteins called Daughterless (Da) and Extramacrochaetae (Emc) regulate organ growth in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. These proteins are members of a family called basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors, which are important for controlling the development of organs. The authors found that Da and Emc work together to control the G2/M transition, a key step in the cell cycle that is necessary for cell proliferation. They also found that Emc controls Da's activity by regulating its expression. The authors used genetic analyses to support their findings and presented evidence that Da represses the activity of a protein called String, which is important for the G2/M transition. Overall, the authors provide a new understanding of how bHLH proteins regulate organ growth by controlling the cell cycle.
The paper presents a new analysis pipeline for phosphoproteomic data generated from interventional experiments, specifically looking at the kinase-dead mutations of S. cerevisiae. The pipeline is designed to identify key proteins in specific pathways, discover protein-protein interactions, and infer the signaling network. The paper uses SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) technique with interventional experiments (kinase-dead mutations) to generate the phosphoproteomic dataset. The major components of the pipeline include phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery. The paper applies the pipeline to identify phosphorylation events underlying the transition to a filamentous growth form in S. cerevisiae. The paper identifies 5 high-confidence proteins from meta-analysis and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis, all of which are involved in stress responses. The paper also tests four of the predicted proteins (Nth1p, Pbi2p, Pdr12p, and Rcn2p) by interventional phenotypic experiments and finds that all of them present differential invasive growth, providing prospective validation of the approach. The paper concludes that the comprehensive pipeline presented in the study is a systematic way for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation. The paper also mentions that the methodology can be applicable as well to other interventional studies via different experimental platforms.
The content of this article is related to the regulation of sex chromosomes in animals and plants. The authors review the two main types of chromosome-level regulation, dosage compensation and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which have evolved independently in different organisms. Dosage compensation is a process that equalizes the balance of X chromosome gene expression between the two sexes. MSCI is the process by which the X chromosome is inactivated in the germline cells of males, which prevents harmful crossing over between the X and Y chromosomes. The authors discuss the evidence for the existence of these processes in different organisms, and the different mechanisms by which they are regulated. They also discuss the implications of these processes for genome evolution and speciation.
Citrobacter rodentium is a bacteria that can cause diarrhea in mice and humans. These bacteria infect the intestines of mice and form microcolonies that attach themselves to the intestinal wall. To better understand the early stages of infection, scientists examined the formation of these microcolonies in wild-type mice. They found that these microcolonies are formed by clonal bacterial populations and are established within 18 hours of infection. These early microcolonies trigger an innate immune response that prevents the formation of new microcolonies by luminal bacteria, which helps prevent severe infection and inflammation. This study highlights the importance of understanding the early stages of infection to better treat and prevent diarrheal diseases.
This research paper proposes a new method for estimating the overlap between two populations, such as gene variants or species. This is a common problem in biology and medicine, especially in the field of malaria research. Currently, researchers often use a method called the Sørenson-Dice coefficient to estimate overlap, but this method is biased and does not take into account the uncertainty of the estimates. The new method proposed in this paper uses Bayesian inference to estimate overlap and provides error bars that represent the uncertainty of the estimates. This allows researchers to quantify the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty, which is important for study planning and budgeting. The paper also extends the Bayesian approach to compute the tradeoff between increasing sampling and decreasing the uncertainty of overlap estimates in the case of P. falciparum. The open-source code and a web tool for using this method are freely available.
Eukaryotic protein kinases, or EPKs, are a type of enzyme that are involved in many cellular processes and have been linked to a variety of diseases. In order to function, these enzymes need to go through a process called the catalytic cycle, which involves the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a protein substrate. Researchers have used a combination of biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques to study this process in detail. They have found that the β3-lysine residue, which was previously thought to be essential for phosphoryl transfer, is actually not required for this step. Instead, the researchers found that it is important for the mechanics of the catalytic cycle. They also discovered that two conserved residues in the αC-helix and the R-spine are involved in a salt bridge that helps to connect these two regions. In the absence of the salt bridge, the researchers were able to restore the mechanics of the catalytic cycle by making changes to the hydrophobicity of the R-spine and Shell residues.
The article describes a study comparing the effectiveness of two different survey designs for post-MDA surveillance: a school-based TAS of children aged 6–7 years and a community-based survey of individuals aged ≥8 years. The study found that the community-based survey was more effective at identifying foci of ongoing transmission compared to the school-based TAS.
Zebrafish is a widely used model organism for studying genetics and development. However, how sex is determined in this species is not well understood. In domesticated zebrafish, sex determination seems to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies have shown that oocytes are necessary for female sex maintenance, but how they control sex differentiation is unknown. In this study, researchers generated targeted mutations in two genes for oocyte-produced signaling molecules, Bmp15 and Gdf9, and reported a novel role for Bmp15 in maintaining adult female sex differentiation in zebrafish. Females deficient in Bmp15 initially developed normally, but during the mid- to late-juvenile stage, they switched sex and became fertile males. The researchers also found that estrogen production by aromatase was necessary for female development and that Bmp15 may be linked to the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis. Their results suggest that oocytes play an important role in maintaining the female sexual phenotype in zebrafish and provide insights into the mechanisms of sex determination in this species.
The Hox proteins are important for controlling the diverse patterns of structures that are found along the front-back (anterior-posterior) axis of animals. They do this by controlling which genes are turned on or off in specific places at specific times during development. To achieve this, Hox proteins work with other proteins that help control the expression of their target genes. In this study, the authors investigated how the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) controls the expression of a cell death gene called reaper (rpr). They found that Dfd works with at least eight other proteins to turn on rpr expression in specific places along the front-back axis. This study shows how Hox proteins can work with other proteins to precisely control the expression of their target genes.
Plants defend themselves from pathogens by recognizing specific molecules called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) on the pathogen's surface and inside the plant cell. These molecules are detected by proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the plant's cell surface and inside the plant cell. PRRs then send a signal to activate a defense response. If the pathogen has molecules called effectors, which can suppress the plant's defense response, the PRR can no longer send a signal and the plant's defense response is not activated. Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins are a type of protein that can recognize effectors and trigger a defense response. The plant NLR protein ADR1-L2 is one type of NLR protein that can recognize an effector from the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae and trigger a defense response. ADR1-L2 also recognizes other types of effectors from different bacteria. ADR1-L2 is part of a family of NLR proteins called the ADR1 family.
In the present study, we discovered that MORC6, a microrchidia ATPase family protein, plays a critical role in transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis. MORC6 interacts with SUVH9 and forms a complex with the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF to silence target genes. We found that IDN2, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein required for RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), also interacts with MORC6 and is involved in transcriptional silencing. MORC6, SUVH9, and IDN2 are all required for transcriptional silencing at a subset of MORC6 target loci. Additionally, other RdDM components including SUVH2, Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2 are also required for transcriptional silencing at some MORC6 target loci. Our findings suggest that the function of MORC6 in transcriptional silencing is different from its role in the RdDM pathway.
Researchers have found that Hsp90, a heat shock protein that is known to help newborn proteins fold and mature, can also change how a protein works and what it does. They used zebrafish as a model to study how inhibiting Hsp90 could affect the severity of different eye defects. They found that in some cases, inhibiting Hsp90 could worsen or even create new eye defects, while in other cases, it could improve the severity of the defects. This is important because it suggests that Hsp90 might be able to modify the effects of different genetic mutations in different ways, which could have implications for how genetic mutations are expressed and might even affect the development of diseases.
N-terminal acetylation is a common modification that happens to the proteins during or right after the process of translation. It is well known that some proteins need this modification to function properly, but the exact biological function of this modification is not yet fully understood. To understand the biological function of N-terminal acetylation, scientists need to be able to manipulate the presence or absence of this modification in a protein. In this study, researchers used Drosophila proteins to develop a method to genetically modify proteins to study the importance of N-terminal acetylation in cells and whole organisms. This method can be used to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in any organism since the rules governing this modification seem to be conserved.
The ability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) to efficiently recycle from termination to reinitiation is crucial for abundant transcription. However, the termination mechanisms used by RNAP and its link to high transcription output are not well understood. In this study, the authors used two tRNA-mediated suppression systems to screen for Rpc1 mutants with gain- and loss- of termination phenotypes in S. pombe. They identified 122 point mutations that clustered in the active center bridge helix and trigger loop, as well as the pore and funnel. The authors also demonstrated that the funnel entrance is involved in the RNA cleavage domain of the C11 subunit in termination. The mutants exhibited good correlations of terminator readthrough in vitro and in vivo, and surprisingly, amounts of transcription in vivo. The authors propose that the mobile elements of the RNAP III active center, including C11, are key determinants of termination, and that some of the mutations activate RNAP III for overall transcription. The results suggest that the RNA cleavage domain of the C11 subunit plays an important role in termination and recycling, and that some of the mutations can be rate-limiting for transcription in vivo. The authors also found a frequently isolated mutant that bears a mutation at the same conserved position as a recently reported human RPC1 mutant in spontaneous cancer.
Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues by tyrosine kinases turns on the recognition of phosphorylated site by SH2 domains, leading to regulation of cellular localization, enzymatic activity, and formation of multiprotein complexes. SH2 domains bind to different spectra of phosphopeptides. The in vitro binding specificity of SH2 domains is commonly determined using peptide libraries, which are summarized in the form of consensus sequences or as position-specific scoring matrices and then used to predict and characterize novel in vivo SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions. However, genome-wide determination of the binding specificity of SH2 domains using peptide libraries is impractical given the more than one hundred human SH2 domains and the limited complexity of the peptide libraries available. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new structure-based algorithm to predict the specificity of SH2 domains. We used FoldX, an empirical force field for the prediction of protein energetics, to predict the binding specificity of nine human SH2 domains with known structure. Our calculations can reproduce experimental consensus target sequences. FoldX performs as well as experimentally derived consensus sequences or position-specific substitution matrices in the prediction of in vitro SH2-phosphopeptide binding and in vivo SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions. Together with information on phosphorylation and secondary structure, FoldX can give accurate predictions of novel protein-protein interactions. We used the developed method to predict a high confidence SH2 interaction network and validated it using information on co-expression, conservation of the interaction in other species, shared interaction partners, and shared GO functions, integrated using a naive Bayes network. The predicted interactions can be used to derive biologically relevant testable hypothesis.
This study focused on the discovery of a protein that can break down amyloids, which are clumps of abnormal proteins that form in neurodegenerative diseases. The researchers identified a protein called cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) that can break down amyloids into smaller, less harmful pieces. CyP40 is a type of peptidyl-prolyl isomerase, which is an enzyme that can change the shape of proline amino acids in proteins. The researchers found that CyP40 can bind to and change the shape of proline amino acids in amyloids, which helps break them down into smaller pieces. The researchers also found that CyP40 can break down other types of aggregating proteins, which are proteins that form harmful clumps. In addition, the researchers found that CyP40 can bind to and change the shape of proline amino acids in a different way when it is in a different shape. This new shape of CyP40 may help it break down amyloids more efficiently. The researchers tested CyP40 in a mouse model of tau accumulation, which is a type of neurodegenerative disease. They found that CyP40 can reduce the amount of amyloids in the mouse's brain and improve the health of the mouse's neurons. Overall, this study suggests that CyP40 could be used as a treatment for tauopathies, which are diseases that involve the buildup of abnormal tau proteins in the brain.
Heterocysts are specialized cells in cyanobacteria that are able to fix nitrogen. They are different from other cells in the filament that are responsible for photosynthesis. To understand the differentiation process of heterocysts, a mathematical model is developed that combines the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacterium with the diffusion of combined nitrogen along the filament. The model shows that the onset of differentiation is dependent on noise and that the efficiency of the filament to form heterocysts is a response to the noisy conditions of the natural environment.
Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease that is transmitted by black flies and causes skin and eye lesions. The Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program is a strategy that has been used to treat onchocerciasis in Africa for more than 15 years. This study was conducted in three regions of Cameroon with high onchocerciasis prevalence. The aim was to find out if people's beliefs and perceptions about the disease and the CDTI program were associated with their adherence to ivermectin. The study found that people who had a negative appreciation of community drug distributors' commitment were less likely to adhere to ivermectin. The most common misconception about onchocerciasis transmission was the lack of hygiene. In Bafang, a high proportion of people believed that onchocerciasis was caused by high consumption of sugar. Overall, the study highlights the importance of community involvement and education in improving adherence to ivermectin and achieving onchocerciasis elimination goals.
In this study, researchers have combined DNA methylation, SNP, and protein biomarker data from 1,033 samples for a variety of diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. They used two different types of association studies, epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS), to identify genetic and epigenetic factors associated with protein biomarkers. They found 124 and 45 loci associated with biomarkers in EWAS and GWAS, respectively. However, they noted that many of the EWAS signals were driven by underlying genetic variants and some were confounded by smoking. The researchers suggest that further research is needed to determine whether epigenetic factors play a causal role in disease development.
Natural killer (NK) cells are immune cells that help the body fight viral infections. It is known that NK cells can become infected with the varicella zoster virus (VZV), which causes chickenpox and shingles. However, it is not clear how VZV affects NK cells. In this study, we found that VZV can impair the ability of NK cells to respond to target cell stimulation, leading to a loss of both cytolytic (killing) and cytokine (protein messengers) responses. This impairment was not only seen in NK cells that were directly infected with VZV, but also in NK cells that were exposed to VZV in culture. The impairment was caused by direct contact between NK cells and VZV infected inoculum cells. Additionally, VZV infection of NK cells led to a reduction in the production of IFN-γ and TNF cytokines. However, this was not seen with the closely related virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which also infected NK cells, but did not impair their function. These findings suggest that VZV has evolved strategies to evade detection and killing by NK cells.
Perceptual phenomenon known as "apparent motion" (AM) can be described as the illusion of a moving object when two stationary objects are presented in alternating locations. Some studies suggest that AM is caused by increased activation of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons tuned to locations along the AM path. However, the evidence is inconclusive, and a predictive coding model has been proposed to explain AM masking, a phenomenon where the detectability of stimuli along the AM path is reduced. The present study investigated AM masking and found that it is strongest when the target orientation matches the orientation of the inducing stimuli. A V1-like population code model was developed based on a standard contrast normalization model. The study found that AM-related activation in early visual cortex is not sufficient to cause masking or be perceived as motion. The study instead supports the theoretical framework of predictive coding, which predicts strong suppression of early sensory responses during AM.
Tax is a protein produced by HTLV-1 that is responsible for transforming T cells and causing various diseases in humans. It is not clear exactly how Tax causes IKK to activate, which is necessary for Tax-induced transformation. Researchers have suggested several different mechanisms, but it is not clear which is correct. To solve this problem, the researchers used a cell-free system to study the biochemical process of Tax-induced IKK activation. They found that Tax is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, which works with other cellular components to produce free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains. These free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains are then responsible for direct IKK activation by binding to the NEMO subunit of IKK. The researchers concluded that Tax uses the minimal cellular ubiquitination components to activate IKK, which is necessary for Tax-induced transformation.
Researchers analyzed the relationship between the number of individuals introduced to a new location and the probability that the species would become established in that location. They found that the relationship was positive, meaning that the probability of establishment increased with more individuals introduced. The researchers also found that this relationship was the same for all taxa and life histories, including plants, animals, and long-lived trees. They also found that the relationship was strongest when the number of individuals introduced was between 10 and 100. The researchers also analyzed how different study methods, such as observational and experimental studies, affected the strength of the relationship. They found that studies that measured propagule pressure directly, such as through experimental releases, produced larger effect sizes than those that used proxies.
Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a protein that helps regulate the immune system and inflammation. Recent research has shown that IL-17 can also affect how certain proteins that are responsible for breaking down mRNA molecules interact with the mRNA molecules they are trying to break down. In particular, IL-17 can affect how a group of proteins called AU-rich element binding proteins (AUBps) bind to the mRNA molecules they are trying to break down. This can change how quickly or slowly the mRNA molecules are broken down.
In Uganda, HAT is caused by T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense. Both forms of the disease were confined to separate regions of the country until recently, when they have started to converge. The acute form of the disease has been spreading rapidly to new districts, linked to movement of infected cattle following restocking. Cattle act as a long-term reservoir of human infective T. b. rhodesiense, showing few signs of morbidity. It is important to understand the relationship between infected cattle and infected individuals so that an appropriate response can be made to the risk posed to the community from animals infected with human pathogens in a village setting. This paper examines the relationship between human T. b. rhodesiense infection and human infective and non-human T. brucei s. l. circulating in cattle at village level in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts in Uganda. The study was undertaken in villages that had reported a case of sleeping sickness in the six months prior to sample collection and those villages that had never reported a case of sleeping sickness. The sleeping sickness status of the villages had a significant effect with higher odds of infection in cattle from case than from non-case villages for T. brucei s. l. (OR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.38–6.24). Cattle age had a significant effect on the likelihood of T. brucei s. l. infection within cattle: cattle between 18–36 months (OR: 3.51, 95% CI: 1.63–7.51) and cattle over 36 months (OR: 4.20, 95% CI: 2.08–8.67) had significantly higher odds of T. brucei s. l. infection than cattle under 18 months of age. Furthermore, village human sleeping sickness status had a significant effect (p<0.05) on the detection of T. b. rhodesiense in the village cattle herd, with significantly higher likelihood of T. b. rhodesiense in the village cattle of case villages (OR: 25, 95% CI: 1.2–520.71). Overall, a higher than average T. brucei s. l. prevalence (>16.3%) in a village herd over was associated with significantly higher likelihood of T. b. rhodesiense being detected in a herd (OR: 25, 95% CI: 1.2–520.71).
The NSL complex is a group of proteins that bind to genes and play a role in gene expression. To understand how the NSL complex functions, we first need to identify the genes that it binds to. We used a technique called ChIP-seq to do this. We found that the NSL complex binds to a large number of genes in the genome. These genes are important for the development of flies and other animals. We also found that the NSL complex prefers to bind to genes that are turned on all the time, rather than genes that are turned on only at certain times or in certain places. This is a very important discovery because it helps us understand how the NSL complex works. Our findings will help us to better understand how genes are turned on and off, and how this affects the development of animals.
Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a rare genetic disorder that affects muscles. It is caused by a chromosome mutation that leads to decreased repression of a specific repeat called D4Z4. This mutation results in abnormal expression of a gene called DUX4, which can cause inflammation and damage to muscle tissue. Researchers have generated transgenic mice that carry a version of the D4Z4 repeat from a normal human chromosome or from a mutated human chromosome. These mice have similar epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes to humans with the same chromosome mutation. The mice can therefore serve as a model for understanding the molecular mechanisms of FSHD and testing new treatments.
Malaria vaccine candidates based on the antigen Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) induce protection but only against parasites that are similar to the vaccine. Researchers have developed a new vaccine that contains four diverse allelic proteins, 3D7, FVO, HB3, and W2mef (AMA1 Quadvax or QV). This vaccine elicits polyclonal rabbit antibodies that are broadly inhibitory against a wide range of parasites. Comparing these antibodies to antibodies from a monovalent, 3D7-specific vaccine, researchers found that the QV antibodies were more effective at inhibiting the invasion of diverse strains of Plasmodium falciparum. They also identified novel inhibition susceptible regions and epitopes on AMA1, which can serve as the basis for improving the antigenic breadth and inhibitory response of AMA1 vaccines. They used the information from these studies to design a new, more effective vaccine that can provide universal coverage against malaria.
In C. elegans embryos, the asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle is important for cell division. The mitotic spindle displaces to one side of the cell after chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate, typically just before anaphase. This displacement is thought to be driven by forces that are generated within the cell. Here, the authors show that the mitotic progression pathway regulates spindle displacement. Specifically, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, and the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) are required for timely spindle displacement. They also show that the APC is a timer for spindle displacement, and that the displacement is delayed until CDK is inactivated by the APC. These findings suggest that the mitotic progression pathway plays an important role in ensuring that spindle components are fully assembled before they begin to move away from the center of the cell.
High-altitude hypoxia (low oxygen levels due to decreased atmospheric pressure) can cause severe stress on the human body. Two places where humans have lived for millennia are the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau. Populations living at these high altitudes have unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations. However, little is known about the genetic basis of these adaptations. In this study, the authors used a genome scan to identify genes that may be involved in adaptation to high altitude. They looked at specific genes and genomic regions that are known to be involved in oxygen metabolism and sensing. By using four different population genetic statistics, they identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in the Andean and Tibetan populations separately. They found that there are different genetic adaptations in the Andean and Tibetan populations. The study provides important insights into the genetic mechanisms responsible for adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia and contributes to our understanding of the genetic and evolutionary architecture of adaptation to altitude.
Scientists have discovered that inverted DNA repeats (IRs) near a DNA break can cause the repair of the break to go wrong and lead to genetic instability. The IRs can form unusual DNA structures that interfere with accurate DNA repair. It has been shown that the length of the spacer between the IRs determines whether they form these unusual DNA structures. IRs with a longer spacer form structures that lead to inverted dimers and chromosome rearrangements, while IRs with a shorter spacer form structures that lead to gene conversion. This study highlights the importance of the choice of DNA repair pathway in maintaining genome stability.
The study investigates the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms to cause infections in Drosophila melanogaster. Biofilms were developed in vivo in the crop of Drosophila. AMPs were induced following oral infection with Pel positive and negative strains. The Pel negative strain, which is more virulent, was more effective in inducing AMPs. The study highlights the ability of P. aeruginosa to induce AMPs in vivo and the potential for biofilms to play a role in infections.
The study by [provide the last name of the first author and the year of publication] used genetic engineering to create mice with the prairie vole version of the vasopressin 1a receptor (V1aR) gene. The study found that replacing the mouse version of the V1aR gene's 5′ flanking region with the prairie vole version did not change the overall pattern of V1aR expression in the brain. However, the study did find that changing the microsatellite region within the 5′ flanking region of the gene could alter the pattern of V1aR expression in the brain. The study also found that these differences in brain gene expression patterns were associated with differences in stress-coping behavior in the forced swim test. The study suggests that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes can contribute to diversity in gene expression, providing a mechanism for generating behavioral diversity both at the individual and species level.
In B cells, transcription of certain parts of their DNA (S regions) generates stable RNA-DNA hybrids that are targeted by a special enzyme called Activation Induced Deaminase (AID). This enzyme then deaminates certain parts of the DNA, which can lead to genetic rearrangements called chromosomal translocations. These genetic rearrangements are thought to be linked to a specific protein complex called THO, which is involved in processing and exporting RNA from the nucleus. When this complex is missing, the DNA is more likely to be damaged and rearranged. Researchers have developed a way to study these genetic rearrangements in yeast, which has helped them understand more about how THO and AID work together to prevent DNA damage and maintain the genome stable.
This study is about how bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli, coordinate the process of cell division with the replication of their chromosomes. This is important because if a cell is not able to divide properly, it cannot reproduce and will eventually die. Previous studies have shown that E. coli coordinate cell division with chromosome replication by positioning the cell division machinery in such a way that it is always near the nucleoid (the region of the cell where the chromosomes are located). However, this study shows that even when the cell division machinery is not positioned near the nucleoid, E. coli can still successfully divide and replicate their chromosomes. This study also provides new information about the role of DNA translocase, FtsK, in this process. It shows that FtsK can pump as much as 80% of the chromosome between daughter cells at a rate of 1700 bp per second. The study also provides evidence that a narrow constriction of the cell is required for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK. This study helps us understand how bacteria coordinate cell division with chromosome replication and provides new information about the role of DNA translocase in this process.
Epitope-based vaccines ( EVs ) are a promising approach to vaccine development. They use small antigenic peptides ( epitopes ) to trigger an immune response, which can protect against infectious diseases or cancer. However, the selection of the best epitopes for an EV is a challenging task. A mathematical framework based on integer linear programming has been developed to efficiently identify optimal sets of epitopes from a user-defined set of candidate peptides. This framework can be used to optimize various immunological requirements, such as population coverage and antigen coverage, and has shown to outperform a simple greedy heuristic and a previously suggested evolutionary algorithm. The integer linear program can be solved very efficiently for all practical problem sizes and the framework is flexible enough to account for variants of the problem.
HIV-1 infections in women mainly occur through vaginal intercourse, where semen containing the virus is deposited on the mucosa. Semen is more than just a carrier of the virus as it contains many biological factors, including cytokines. IL-7, a prominent cytokine found in semen, has been linked to increased transmission and dissemination of HIV-1 infections. A recent study has found that IL-7 enhances virus replication in ex vivo infected cervico-vaginal tissue, as well as in lymphoid tissue explants. This was due to IL-7 preventing apoptosis and promoting the proliferation of CD4+ T cells. The high levels of IL-7 in seminal plasma of HIV-1-infected individuals may be relevant to the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of HIV infection. This study highlights the role of IL-7 in HIV-1 transmission and suggests that it may be a potential target for interventions to prevent HIV infection.
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a virus that can be transmitted by mosquitoes. Mosquitoes use a defense system called RNA interference (RNAi) to fight against viruses. There are two RNAi pathways involved in antiviral responses: the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) and exogenous short interfering RNA (exo-siRNA) pathways. ZIKV-specific siRNAs are produced in mosquitoes and are loaded into the exo-siRNA pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2). The exo-siRNA pathway is thought to be the key mosquito antiviral response mechanism. ZIKV-specific piRNA-sized small RNAs are also detected in mosquitoes, but they lack the characteristic piRNA ping-pong signature motif and are bound to Ago3 but not Piwi5 or Piwi6. The knockdown of Ago2 does not enhance ZIKV replication, and only Piwi4 displays antiviral activity. The expression of ZIKV capsid protein amplifies the replication of a reporter alphavirus, but unlike yellow fever virus capsid protein, it does not inhibit the exo-siRNA pathway. These findings are important in understanding the ZIKV-mosquito interaction and may support efforts to understand the rapid spread of this virus.
Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that typically affects the skin and can spread to other parts of the body. It has been linked to several different species, including Sporothrix schenckii and Sporothrix brasiliensis. In this study, researchers investigated the relationship between different Sporothrix species and the clinical aspects of sporotrichosis observed in an endemic area of Brazil. They found that Sporothrix brasiliensis was associated with more severe infections and a higher risk of dissemination to other parts of the body.
The paper aims to find out how much of the mammalian genome is transcribed and what kind of transcripts are produced. They looked at human and mouse tissues and cell lines to see how much of the genome was transcribed and what kind of transcripts were produced. They used a few different techniques such as single- and paired-end RNA-Seq and tiling arrays. They found that most transcription happens in known exons and ncRNAs, and that most of the extra transcription that happens outside known exons and ncRNAs is actually fragments of pre-mRNAs. They also found that many of the transcripts that happen outside known exons and ncRNAs are associated with open chromatin, which means they are probably functional. They conclude that a lot of the mammalian genome is transcribed, and that there are a lot of different kinds of transcripts, but that most of them are probably functional.
Protein stability is very important for its applications in biotechnology. In this paper, we describe an approach to engineer a more thermostable blue light-absorbing protein called YtvA from the bacterium Aequorea victoria. Firstly, a 250-mutant library was generated using error-prone PCR. Secondly, 73 mutations from the library were predicted to increase the protein's stability using FoldX, a software package based on molecular dynamics simulations. Thirdly, 44 of the 73 mutants were selected for experimental validation based on the free energy calculations, and 13 of them were shown to be more stable than the wild-type YtvA. Finally, a multiple mutant approach was taken to further improve the protein's stability. The most thermostable mutant was a triple mutant N107Y-N124Y-M111F, which increased the protein's melting temperature by 31°C without compromising its fluorescence brightness. This work provides a new approach to engineer more thermostable proteins, which can be widely used in biotechnology.
We examined sand flies in Panama to determine their relationships to each other and their infection status with Leishmania and Wolbachia. We found two species, Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi, that carry Leishmania at high frequency and are likely vectors of the disease. We also found distinct strains of Wolbachia in three species, including Lu. trapidoi.
This article describes how human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivates from its latent state in dendritic cells (DCs). The researchers show that ERK-mediated reactivation depends on the activation of a group of kinases called MSKs, which in turn are activated by CREB binding to the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). They also found that MSK-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. Taken together, these results suggest that CREB binding to the MIEP is necessary for the recruitment of the kinase activity of MSKs to initiate the chromatin remodelling at the MIEP required for reactivation.
This paper is about a protein called NOL11 that is needed for making ribosomes. Ribosomes are small machines inside cells that make all the proteins that our bodies need to work. Without ribosomes, cells cannot make proteins and eventually die. NOL11 is important for making ribosomes in human tissue culture cells, but its role in embryos is not known. In this paper, the researchers studied NOL11 in a type of embryo called a frog embryo. They found that NOL11 is needed for making ribosomes in frog embryos too. They also found that when NOL11 is not there, the embryos have a craniofacial defect. Craniofacial defects are problems with the development of the face and skull. The researchers showed that this defect is due to problems with making ribosomes, not because the embryos are missing NOL11. They also showed that the defect can be fixed by removing p53, a protein that helps cells deal with problems. This paper shows that NOL11 is important for making ribosomes in embryos and that it helps control the development of the face and skull.
A research group developed an efficient diagnostic test for leptospirosis, a widespread zoonotic disease that causes severe symptoms. The test was developed by identifying 16 and 18 antigens that can discriminate between acute and convalescent cases. These novel antigens could potentially be used to develop new diagnostic tests for leptospirosis.
This paper is about the role of a type of defense response called melanization in mosquitoes. Melanization is a process that involves the formation of a black layer around an invading organism. This layer is made of a substance called melanin, which is produced by the insect's body. Melanization is thought to be an important defense mechanism in insects, as it can kill or inhibit the growth of invading microorganisms. However, little is known about how melanization works in mosquitoes. In this study, researchers used a type of mosquito called Anopheles gambiae as a model to study how melanization works in mosquitoes. They looked at how melanization affects a fungus called Beauveria bassiana, which infects mosquitoes. They found that melanization can slow down the growth of B . bassiana, but it does not kill it. They also found that two proteins that are important for melanization in mosquitoes (TEP1 and CLIPA8) are not needed to slow down the growth of B . bassiana. This study provides important information about how mosquitoes defend themselves against fungal infections.
The article describes a study investigating potential mosquito host factors (HFs) that are essential for dengue virus (DENV) infection in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The study evaluated the effectiveness of known mammalian DENV HF inhibitors in blocking DENV infection in mosquitoes, using various treatment methods, including direct injection, sugar feeding, and blood feeding. The results showed that the compound bafilomycin, which inhibits vacuolar H+-ATPase (vATPase), and mycophenolic acid, which inhibits inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), effectively inhibited DENV infection in the mosquito midgut and salivary gland. The study provides evidence for the potential of chemical inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of DENV HFs as a novel method to reduce DENV transmission.
Our study aims to investigate how cell volume affects neuronal dynamics in conditions such as epileptic seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization. We have developed a detailed model of a neuron that incorporates cell swelling and dynamic ion concentrations, as well as oxygen supply, into Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking dynamics. Our study shows that the spontaneous transition between epileptic seizure and spreading depression states can be seen in our model neuron as it swells and contracts in response to changes in osmotic pressure. We also provide a definition for the experimentally described physiological ceiling that separates seizure from spreading depression, as well as predict a second ceiling that separates spreading depression from anoxic depolarization. Our model highlights the neuroprotective role of glial K buffering against seizures and spreading depression, and provides novel insights into anoxic depolarization and the relevant cell swelling during ischemia. We suggest that the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization lie along a continuum of the neuron membrane repertoire, and can be understood only when the dynamic ion concentrations, oxygen homeostasis, and cell swelling in response to osmotic pressure are taken into consideration.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a fungus that causes a serious lung infection called paracoccidioidomycosis. This infection is very common in South America and can be deadly. Researchers have found that the NLRP3 inflammasome, a protein complex that fights off infection, is important for fighting this fungus. The inflammasome is activated when the fungus enters the cells of the body, and it helps the body to fight off the infection. The researchers also found that IL-1β, a protein that helps to fight off the infection, is important for killing the fungus. Overall, the study shows that the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β are important for fighting off P. brasiliensis infections.
Toxoplasma gondii is a type of parasite that affects the brain and is found in the nervous system of many people. In the lab, Toxoplasma can infect both neurons and astrocytes. However, in the body, it is mostly found in neurons. Scientists have a theory that astrocytes can kill Toxoplasma and clear it from the body, and that because neurons cannot do this, they are the primary host for Toxoplasma in the brain. To test this theory, scientists used new technology that could track which cells directly interact with Toxoplasma in the body. They found that neurons are the primary target of Toxoplasma, not astrocytes. This means that neurons may be more important for the survival of Toxoplasma than previously thought.
In this paper, the authors present a simplified model to understand how cells move when they are undergoing a type of movement called lamellipodial motility. The model takes into account the force-balance and myosin transport equations to describe how the actin-myosin network in the cell bulk interacts with the actin growth and membrane mechanics at the boundary to shape, stabilize, and propel the cell. The authors find that when the contractility is weak, the cell is stationary. However, when the contractility is strong, the cell breaks symmetry and moves steadily along either a straight or circular trajectory. Additionally, the authors find that when fast protrusion destabilizes the axial symmetry of the planar myosin distribution or cell shape, the cell exhibits turning behavior. The motile behavior of the cell is also sensitive to conditions of force balance at the cell boundary. Overall, the authors propose a simplified model that can be used to understand the mechanics of lamellipodial motility.
In this paper, we propose a novel method to assess the confidence of interactions in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We use a geometric random graph model to predict new interactions and guide future biological experiments. We have tested our method on a human PPI network obtained from BioGRID and found 251 novel interactions with high confidence scores. Using our method, we have predicted interactions between proteins that share common Gene Ontology (GO) terms. We have also validated some of our predicted interactions in the HPRD database and the newest release of BioGRID. Our approach achieves a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 85%. Our results indicate that geometric random graph models are well suited for assessing the confidence of interactions in PPI networks.
Scientists have found that certain human diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy, are caused by repeats of three specific letters in RNA. These diseases can have different versions of the repeat, and some versions have other versions of the repeat in the opposite direction, called "anti-sense." Scientists have been studying these diseases in mice to understand more about how they work. They found that when both versions of the repeat were present together, they were much more toxic than either version alone. The scientists also found that the two versions of the repeat could interact to make tiny "guards" called RNA molecules, which could target other RNA molecules for destruction. This could make the disease worse. This study suggests that scientists should pay attention to how both versions of the repeat might interact in people with these diseases.
We have investigated the characteristics of Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, a well-known model strain of soft rot bacteria. We have revised its taxonomy and shown that it belongs to the species Pectobacterium wasabiae. We have also characterized several genomic islands and identified novel virulence determinants of SCC3193 that could be important during the latent stage of infection. Our findings have expanded our knowledge about the lifestyle of soft rot bacteria, which causes significant losses of potato crops worldwide.
In this study, we examined the changes in the mitochondrial protein composition in response to dysfunctional cellular states. We used network analysis to analyze gene expression data from human mitochondria. By clustering the quantified proteins into functional modules, we were able to determine the systemic properties of mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two distinct modules with different biological processes. The down-regulated modules were responsible for typical mitochondrial functions, while the up-regulated modules were involved in mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Furthermore, we compared proteomics and transcriptomics data, and found that the cells tried to compensate for mtDNA depletion by coordinately regulating the expression and transport of mt proteins. Our results suggest that mt protein composition changes in response to dysfunctional cellular states and provide a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions.
Scientists have found a new way to estimate the rates of biomolecular processes in vivo based on their in vitro measurements. This method, called "kinetic distance," allows them to compare the kinetics of a multistep process in different environments, such as in vitro and in vivo. By using this method, scientists have been able to predict the in vivo rates of protein synthesis in ribosomes, a key process in gene expression. The predictions were validated by three independent sets of in vivo data. This method is relatively simple and can be applied to any biomolecular process for which they have detailed information about the in vitro kinetics. This is important because it provides a more accurate way to study biomolecular processes in vivo, which is difficult to do experimentally. It could also lead to a better understanding of how different environmental factors affect these processes and how they are regulated within cells.
We have estimated the short-term mutation and recombination rates in Helicobacter pylori, a common cause of stomach infections, by sequencing fragments of DNA from 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates. These isolates came from 34 pairs of sequential samples taken at intervals of 0.25 to 10.2 years, and from 29 individuals whose average age was 45 years. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the rates of mutation, recombination, mean length of recombination tracts, and average diversity in those tracts. Our results indicate that the short-term mutation rate is 1.4×10−6 to 4.5×10−6 per nucleotide per year, and that three times as many substitutions are introduced by recombination as by mutation. We also found that the long-term mutation rate over millennia is 5–17-fold lower, partly due to the removal of non-synonymous mutations due to purifying selection. Our estimates of short-term mutation rates vary dramatically in different bacterial species and can span a range of several orders of magnitude. We therefore recommend that age estimates for bacteria be based on species-specific clock rates. We also note that clock rates for genetic diversity between species should not be used for dating within a species.
In this study, the authors explore the contribution of melanopsin-based photoreception to conventional visual pathways in the mammalian retina. They use new reporter lines to show that melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) have much more extensive projections than previously thought and extend across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is the origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. They continue to show that this input supports extensive physiological light responses in the dLGN and visual cortex in mice lacking rods+cones. Moreover, using chromatic stimuli to isolate melanopsin-derived responses in mice with an intact visual system, they reveal strong melanopsin input to the ∼40% of neurons in the LGN that show sustained activation to a light step. They demonstrate that this melanopsin input supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of these neurons. The authors conclude that melanopsin-based photoreception is a significant source of sensory input to the thalamo-cortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods+cones. This finding identifies mRGCs as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception and indicates that they may support vision in people suffering from retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection affects the immune system, especially in the gut where a large amount of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells reside. These cells play an important role in humoral responses and preventing the spread of microbial antigens from the gut to the rest of the body. In this study, researchers found that HIV-1 infection resulted in a decrease in mucosal memory CD4+ T cells and affected the production of antibodies specific to gut bacteria. They discovered that HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4+ T cell counts had reduced levels of IgG and IgA specific to gut bacteria and an increase in IgM levels. This may contribute to the chronic inflammation seen in HIV-1 infection. The study highlights the importance of CD4+ T cells in maintaining the immune response in the gut and emphasizes the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying immune activation in HIV-1 infection.
Ecosystems can only sustain a certain number of species based on the availability of resources. When a population grows, it must balance out by reducing other populations. In neutral models of biodiversity, all populations change slowly due to random births and deaths. We propose a new model that explains how a sudden and severe reduction in the population of a single species releases resources for the remaining ones, causing diversity waves. During these waves, the abundance of species peaks at the beginning and then decreases exponentially. The population distribution is split into two peaks: one composed of species that recently collapsed or newly introduced species, and another composed of species that have not collapsed yet. This peak structure has a long-term memory, and it results in a scale-free tail of the population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7. We show that this model is robust, and it can handle variations in parameters such as the diffusion between environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.
In this study, the authors investigate how the number of CW-rotating motors affects the tumbling angle of E. coli, a chemotactic bacterium. They extended a previously developed hybrid model of E. coli to take into account the duration of CW-rotation of each motor. The authors find that the tumbling angle depends on the number of CW-rotating motors, which causes a difference in tumbling angles for cells swimming up or down a gradient. This difference in tumbling angles leads to a small but significant increase in the chemotactic efficiency of E. coli. The authors suggest that this additional mechanism of tumbling angle tuning helps E. coli navigate through gradients more efficiently.
The thymus is a vital organ that produces T cells, which play a crucial role in the immune system. Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are a key part of the thymus and provide a unique environment that helps T cells develop. TECs produce substances that help T cells grow and mature, and they also help T cells move from one area of the thymus to another. There are two main types of TECs: cortical TECs (cTECs) and medullary TECs (mTECs). cTECs help T cells become mature, and mTECs help T cells develop into T regulatory cells (Tregs), which are important for regulating the immune system. Mice that lack a functional mTEC compartment develop autoimmune diseases.
We have developed and applied a new computational method to search for potential small noncoding RNA (sRNA) genes in the genome of C. difficile. We then validated these predictions through RNA-seq and 5′-end RNA-seq analysis. We found that 250 sRNA genes, including both IGR and cis-antisense RNAs, were expressed in the strain 630Δerm. Most of the detected sRNAs were novel, and their functions are still unknown. We also identified a large number of CRISPR RNAs and RNA-based regulatory mechanisms in C. difficile. Our study provides a foundation for further functional characterization of these sRNAs in C. difficile.
The liver-specific microRNA miR-122 plays a crucial role in the liver and hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle. However, little is known about how the expression of miR-122 is regulated by HCV infection. In this study, the authors found that the HCV core protein inhibits the terminal mononucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD-2, which results in the downregulation of miR-122 isomers bearing non-templated 3′-end single-nucleotide additions. This downregulation of miR-122 isomers leads to the dysregulation of miR-122 function, which in turn affects HCV replication and translation. Overall, the study demonstrates a novel role of the HCV core protein in regulating viral replication and translation through GLD-2-mediated miR-122 stability control.
Trypanosomes are harmful parasites that cause disease in humans and livestock in Africa. Although certain species seem to have developed resistance to these parasites, there has been no evidence of acquired immunity to natural infections. We found that lions, which are wild African animals, have a pattern of infection rates that could be explained by cross-immunity from other trypanosome species. These findings may help in developing vaccines against the disease, even though the surface proteins of trypanosomes are known to be very complex.
The article presents a study that aimed to investigate the role that mathematical modeling and systems biology could play in molecular medicine and clinical development. The researchers used mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis to explore a working hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility in a model of the coagulation cascade could be used as a basis for target selection in drug discovery. The coagulation cascade is a complex biochemical process that involves a variety of proteins and blood cells that work together to prevent excessive bleeding and promote blood clotting. The model, which was validated using 21 datasets, predicted that fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X (fX/FXa) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. These predictions were supported by both in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence. The results suggest that computationally derived points of fragility of human-relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection in drug discovery, despite model uncertainty.
This article describes a study that investigates the kinetics of using bacteriophages (viruses that kill bacteria) as a type of therapy. Researchers examined the interaction between a food-borne pathogen, Campylobacter jejuni, and a suitable virulent phage in an in vitro system. Phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni readily arise, and researchers tested models for phage-bacteria interactions incorporating phage-insensitive or resistant bacteria. The results showed that even an apparently simplistic model fit the data surprisingly well, and the researchers confirmed that the so-called inundation and proliferation thresholds are likely to be of considerable practical importance to phage therapy. They estimated the thresholds and rate constants directly using a comparison of the fit for each culture, revealing density-dependent features of phage infectivity that are worthy of further investigation. The researchers concluded that insight from empirical studies can be greatly enhanced by the use of kinetic models. They recommend that this study serves as an essential precursor to building a meaningful picture of the kinetic properties of in vivo phage therapy.
In this study, the authors provide the first functional characterization of a Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the snail Biomphalaria glabrata, which acts as an intermediate host for the parasite Schistosoma mansoni. The TLR is called BgTLR and was identified as part of a peptide screen of snail immune cell surface proteins. The authors found that BgTLR is involved in the cellular immune response of the snail following challenge with S. mansoni, and knockdown of BgTLR altered the resistant phenotype of the snail, leading to patent infections in 43% of the normally resistant snails, which shed S. mansoni cercariae one week before the susceptible controls. This study represents the first functional characterization of a gastropod TLR and demonstrates that BgTLR is an important snail immune receptor that is capable of influencing infection outcome following S. mansoni challenge.
The study aims to develop an immuno-epidemiological tool to assess human exposure to mosquito bites of Aedes mosquitoes, which transmit infectious diseases. This tool will be a test to detect the presence of IgG directed against proteins from the salivary gland extracts (SGE) of Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis in human populations. The test was conducted on Tahiti and Moorea islands where these mosquitoes are present, and a cohort of people from metropolitan France, not exposed to these Aedes mosquitoes, was used as a control. The results showed that 98% and 68% of individuals have developed IgG directed against Ae . aegypti and Ae . polynesiensis SGE , respectively. This new immuno-epidemiological tool will help to evaluate the risk of disease transmission and to assess the efficacy of novel vector control strategies in French Polynesia and other tropical settings.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis (TB), is able to infect humans and survive inside our cells thanks to its ability to adapt to the intracellular environment of human macrophages. In this paper, the authors explore how this process happens by studying the metabolic reactions of both the host and the pathogen. They found that Mtb pathogenicity is linked to its ability to regulate the host cell's metabolism, and that this regulation is crucial for the survival of both the host and the pathogen. By studying the metabolic reactions of cells infected with different strains of Mtb, the authors were able to identify the specific host reactions that are targeted, and how these reactions help the pathogen survive. This finding provides a framework for understanding how both the host and the pathogen contribute to the pathology of TB.
Meiosis is a special kind of cell division that produces haploid gametes from diploid cells. To ensure proper division, the chromosomes must pair up and recombine. This process is regulated by proteins like ZHP-3, which is a protein that is required for crossover recombination and meiotic segregation.
The paper discusses a study that looked at the factors affecting the abundance and distribution of the mosquito Aedes albopictus in Rome, Italy. This mosquito is an invasive species that has spread worldwide in recent decades, including to temperate regions of Europe and the United States. In Rome, the mosquito has become a public health concern due to its ability to transmit exotic arboviruses and its aggressive daytime outdoor biting behavior. The study used two datasets to analyze the effects of climatic and socio-environmental variables on the mosquito's abundance and distribution. The results showed an association between highly anthropized habitats and high mosquito abundance in both metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas. The study also found a bimodal seasonal dynamics with a second peak of abundance in autumn, due to heavy rains occurring in the preceding weeks in association with permissive temperatures. These findings provide useful indications to prioritize public mosquito control measures in temperate urban areas where nuisance, human-mosquito contact and risk of local arbovirus transmission are likely higher.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, has a unique cell envelope that is made up of mostly lipids. One group of lipids, called phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM), has been studied extensively because it is thought to be a virulence factor of Mtb. DIM are made of a mixture of long-chain β-diols esterified by multimethyl-branched fatty acids named mycocerosic acids. They are found near the surface of the bacilli and are thought to be part of the mycobacterial pseudo-outer membrane. DIM have been shown to play a role in cell wall permeability and many studies have implicated these molecules in the pathogenicity of Mtb. However, it is not clear how DIM mediate pathogenesis, whether they act as effectors or modify host immune responses. Recent studies have shown that DIM contribute to the initial growth of Mtb in mice by protecting it from the nitric oxide-dependent killing of macrophages and modulating the production of key inflammatory cytokines. This suggests that DIM may be involved in modulating the immune responses of murine macrophages, although the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which DIM participate in the cross-talk between Mtb and macrophages are unclear. Mycobacteria make use of the phagocytic machinery of macrophages to gain access to the interior of the cell and subvert phagosome maturation. At the interface between mycobacteria and macrophages, the complex outermost layer of the mycobacterial cell wall may play a role in facilitating host cell entry. DIM are located in the outer layer of Mtb cell envelope and therefore constitute potential candidates for modulating the initial step of entry into macrophages and for controlling the outcome of bacterial infection. In this study, the authors demonstrate the involvement of DIM in the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb through a mechanism involving plasma membrane reorganisation after bacteria recognition. This modification might enable Mtb to create a protective niche, by preventing phagosome acidification.
Researchers have developed a mathematical approach to describe the behavior of small neural networks with a few tens of neurons, which are an important intermediate level of brain organization. This approach allows for a systematic analysis of the local and global bifurcations of neural activity, and the formation of multiple branching solutions caused by spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This phenomenon is a finite-size effect that reveals previously unexplored differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. The authors found that the most important consequence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking is the ability of small neural networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, which may reduce the detrimental effect of noise correlations on cortical information processing.
In this study, researchers wanted to find out if Leishmania parasites are alive in the blood and other body parts of people who have dermal leishmaniasis. To do this, they used a special type of RNA called 7SLRNA, which is only made by living cells. They found that this RNA was present in the blood cells of people with leishmaniasis, as well as in normal skin and tonsil samples. This suggests that Leishmania parasites are alive and possibly spreading in people with this disease. The study shows that 7SLRNA is a good target for future research on leishmaniasis.
This study aimed to understand the relationship between chromatin features and DNA replication timing in Drosophila. The authors used a machine learning approach called Lasso to analyze a dataset of chromatin feature levels and DNA replication timing in three different cell types of Drosophila. The results showed that combinations of chromatin features are predictive of DNA replication timing. The authors then used a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) to identify a set of features that predict DNA replication timing with high accuracy. The authors also found that the features H3K36me1, H3K27me3, H3K4me1, H3K9me2, and H2BUb are the most important predictors of DNA replication timing. Finally, the authors used these findings to develop a simple model of DNA replication timing that can be generalized to other cell types and potentially used to understand the regulation of DNA replication timing in other organisms.
Dengue fever is a disease caused by the Dengue virus (DENV), which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. The DENV virus has four different serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4), which can cause flu-like symptoms, severe dengue fever, or even death. The largest burden of dengue disease is in tropical and subtropical regions, with an estimated 390 million cases per year. We used a statistical framework to study the spread of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 serotypes in Brazil by looking at complete genome sequences. Our analysis showed that new lineages of these viruses are introduced to Brazil every 7 to 10 years, most likely from the Caribbean region. We also found that the movement of humans and mosquitoes through air travel is a key factor in the spread of dengue viruses, rather than the infestation rates of the mosquito species Aedes aegypti or geographical distances.
The authors are studying how the neural code works in weakly electric fish. Weakly electric fish use electrical signals to sense their environment. They have three different types of sensory maps in their brain that receive input from different parts of their body and respond to different stimuli. The authors have found that all three types of sensory maps have nearly the same correlations between the activities of their neurons. The authors have also used a mathematical model to explain this result. They found that the amount of overlap between the receptive field of the neurons in each map does not determine the correlations. Instead, the authors suggest that the balance between the excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the neurons and the spiking nonlinearity of the neurons are important. The authors also found that the previously published experimental data on differences between the receptive field center-surround organization across the maps gives rise to similar average levels of correlations. Therefore, the authors propose that the similar levels of correlations observed experimentally arise because cells receive similar relative levels of positively and negatively correlated inputs, despite very different RF center-surround organizations.
Sensory neurons are known to show variable responses when they are exposed to the same stimulus repeatedly. These responses are often correlated with each other, but the exact nature of these correlations is not well understood. In this study, researchers investigated how noise correlations between pairs of sensory neurons affect the ability of the population to encode the stimulus. They found that when the noise and signal correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs, encoding performance improves relative to the case where the neurons are independent. However, this improvement is not a necessary condition for good coding performance, as a diverse set of correlation structures can enhance coding even when they do not satisfy this condition. The researchers also showed that the optimal correlation structures must lie on the boundary of the possible set of noise correlations. Finally, they identified conditions under which noise correlations can yield coding performance that is as good as if the neurons had deterministic responses.
In this study, the authors investigated how the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa affects the antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus. The authors found that P. aeruginosa can alter S. aureus's susceptibility to antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner. They identified three independent interactions responsible for antagonizing or potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus. These interactions included the LasA endopeptidase of P. aeruginosa, which potentiates lysis of S. aureus by vancomycin; the ability of P. aeruginosa to facilitate proton-motive force-independent tobramycin uptake, which is a form of potentiation; and the ability of P. aeruginosa to induce multidrug tolerance in S. aureus through respiratory inhibition and reduction of cellular ATP, which is a form of antagonism. The authors found that these factors can vary between clinical isolates and correspond to the capacity of each isolate to alter S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility. The authors also found that vancomycin treatment of a S. aureus mouse burn infection is potentiated by the presence of a LasA-producing P. aeruginosa population. The authors conclude that antibiotic susceptibility is complex and dependent not only on the genotype of the pathogen being targeted but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the infection environment. Consideration of these interactions will improve the treatment of polymicrobial infections.
Dengue fever is a common viral infection that affects millions of people worldwide. It can cause severe complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage, which are associated with a significant decrease in platelet count. Platelets play a critical role in blood clotting and inflammation. Previous research has shown that VWF, a protein involved in blood clotting, binds to platelets in dengue patients and contributes to platelet clearance. In this study, we found that VWF binding to platelets was associated with reduced surface sialic acid in dengue patients, and that this binding process could be inhibited by oseltamivir, a medication that blocks neuraminidase, the enzyme responsible for removing sialic acid. Our findings suggest that VWF binding and platelet desialylation play a role in dengue-associated thrombocytopenia.
This research looks at a type of gene arrangement called "bidirectional gene pairs" in the human genome. These gene pairs are made up of two genes that are next to each other and on opposite strands of DNA, with their transcription start sites being within 1,000 base pairs of each other. The region between their transcription start sites is called a "bidirectional promoter" and it helps control the expression of both genes. These promoters are found repeatedly in the human genome, with over 1,350 examples known. However, the specific biological function of this gene arrangement is not well understood. Researchers have developed a new algorithm to identify and map these promoters using data from a database of spliced expressed sequence tags (ESTs). They have also found evidence that a subset of these promoters, which control genes implicated in certain types of cancer, contain common transcription factor binding sites. This suggests that a disruption in the regulation of these promoters could play a role in the development of cancer.
This study examines the diversity of sex chromosomes in different types of flies. The authors used whole-genome analysis to investigate the sex chromosomes in 37 fly species from 22 different families. They found that the small dot chromosome is repeatedly used as the sex chromosome, possibly reflecting the ancestral karyotype of higher Diptera. The authors also identified species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others in which a different chromosome replaced the dot as a sex chromosome, and others with female heterogamety. Transcriptome analysis showed that dosage compensation has evolved multiple times in flies, consistently through up-regulation of the single X in males. However, the X chromosomes generally show a deficiency of genes with male-biased expression. These species thus provide a rich resource to study sex chromosome biology in a comparative manner and show that similar selective forces have shaped the unique evolution of sex chromosomes in diverse fly taxa.
This study aimed to investigate if there is a link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and microcephaly in the United States. The researchers tested archived blood samples from six mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 mothers who gave birth to healthy babies between 2009 and 2012 in Hawaii. They found that one mother with microcephaly delivered babies tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody and three mothers with microcephaly had ZIKV IgG antibody. There was a trend towards significance with microcephaly for ZIKV IgG antibody positive mothers. They also found that mothers with microcephaly who were positive for ZIKV IgM antibody were more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly. These findings suggest that there may have been cases of ZIKV infection and microcephaly in the United States as early as 2009.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin disease that affects humans and other animals. It is caused by a type of bacteria called Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU). MU can be found in the environment and it is not clear how it is transmitted to humans. To better understand the transmission of MU, researchers have studied the genetic diversity of the bacteria found in humans and the environment. They used a type of DNA analysis called Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) analysis to compare the genetic diversity of MU found in humans and in different water bodies. They also looked at small mammals in the environment to see if they could be reservoirs of MU. They found that MU was present in different types of water bodies and that there were different genetic types of MU found in humans and in the environment. They also found that small mammals could be susceptible to MU infection. The researchers suggest that MU may be transmitted to humans through contact with contaminated water bodies, and that humans may be more likely to become infected if they have contact with MU-contaminated water bodies on a regular basis. The researchers also suggest that small mammals may be a source of MU infection in humans. They suggest that the "OneHealth" approach, which looks at the health of humans, animals, and the environment all together, may be helpful in understanding and preventing the transmission of MU.
Alien species are introduced by humans to new environments, and the number of species introduced can vary over time and location. The causes of this variation are not well understood, but they likely involve a combination of human and environmental factors. To better understand the drivers of variation in alien species richness, we analyzed an extensive new database of alien bird species. We found that the locations of origin and introduction of alien birds, and their identities, were initially driven largely by European colonialism, but recent introductions were a wider phenomenon involving more species and countries, and driven in part by increasing economic activity. We found that, globally, alien bird species richness is currently highest at midlatitudes, and it is strongly determined by the number of species introduced (i.e., colonization pressure). Nevertheless, environmental drivers are also important, with native and alien species richness being strongly and consistently positively associated. Our results emphasize the importance of considering colonization pressure when analyzing alien species richness and highlight the likely ongoing threats to global environments from the introductions of species.
The nucleolus is a visible structure in the nucleus of cells responsible for the synthesis of ribosomes. Ribosomes are necessary for cells to grow and proliferate, and their formation is controlled by various factors. One such factor is a protein called UBF, which was first identified as a co-factor in RNA polymerase I (RPI) transcription. Previous studies have shown that UBF is essential for embryo development beyond morula stage and for the transcription of rRNA genes. However, it is unclear whether UBF is necessary for RPI transcription. In this study, the authors used gene deletion in mouse to confirm that UBF is essential for rRNA gene activity and for embryo development beyond morula stage. They also found that UBF defines the active chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences, and is required for the recruitment of SL1/TIF1B pre-initiation complex and the RPI-Rrn3/TIF1A complex. Unexpectedly, the arrest of rRNA synthesis did not suppress the transcription of other ribosome-related genes. The authors also observed the formation of a large sub-nuclear structure resembling the nucleolar precursor body (NPB) of oocytes and early embryos in cells lacking UBF. This NPB contained rRNA synthesis and processing factors but did not associate with the rRNA gene loci (NORs). Overall, this study provides insights into the role of UBF in RPI transcription, chromatin structure, and ribosome biogenesis.
In the provided article, the authors describe the role of Wingless (Wg) signaling in tissue patterning, including its overactivation in colorectal cancer. The article discusses a recent finding that replacing wild-type Wg with a membrane-tethered form of Wg in Drosophila resulted in viable adults with normal external morphology. However, the authors found that Wg tethering disrupted multiple important roles of Wg during adult intestinal development, including the regulation of target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling crosstalk. These findings support the requirement for the direct, long-range action of Wg in tissue patterning and suggest that its tethering could disrupt normal development and disease.
Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and is known to accumulate cell surface plasmin during disease initiation. However, the role of host activators of plasminogen in this process has not been well understood. In this study, the authors investigated the contribution of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) to invasive GAS disease. They found that the absence of uPA resulted in a significant decrease in virulence of GAS. Furthermore, they discovered that host activators of plasminogen were sufficient to promote cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS during incubation with plasminogen. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of GAS pathogenesis and research aimed at therapeutic targeting of plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.
Scientists have discovered that a protein called CagL is a part of a specialized T4SS (type four secretion system) in the bacteria Helicobacter pylori, which causes gastritis and stomach cancer. The T4SS is required to inject a protein called CagA into the lining of the stomach. The study found that CagL binds to a specific receptor on the surface of gastric epithelial cells to allow for the injection of CagA. The study also found that CagL is necessary for the function of the T4SS, and that it works with two other proteins called CagI and CagH. All three proteins are required for the formation of pili, which are structures that help the bacteria to adhere to the surface of gastric epithelial cells. The study found that CagL and the other proteins contain a conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif that is essential for the function of the T4SS. The findings of this study shed new light on the mechanisms by which H. pylori causes disease.
Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a disease that affects cattle and is caused by a type of bacteria called Mycobacterium bovis. It can cause a lot of damage to the agricultural industry worldwide, costing billions of dollars annually. One way to fight this disease is by vaccinating cattle, but the current vaccine, called BCG, is not very effective. Researchers are trying to make a better vaccine by improving upon BCG, but they need to find ways to know if the vaccine is working. One way they are trying to do this is by looking at the genes that are expressed by the cattle's immune system after being vaccinated. They found that some genes were more expressed in vaccinated-protected cattle than in vaccinated-unprotected or unvaccinated cattle. One of these genes was IL-22, which is a protein that helps the immune system fight off infections. They also found that the pathway related to this gene was the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. They then confirmed that IL-22 was a good predictor of vaccine efficacy by testing it in an independent set of samples. This is important because it can help researchers know if their new vaccines are working and if they can be used to fight bTB in cattle.
In this study, the authors wanted to understand how microtubule organizing centers ( MTOCs ) organize and regulate microtubules in differentiated cells. They found that at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells in Caenorhabditis elegans , there is a non-centrosomal MTOC where both γ-TuRC and AIR-1 localize. However, only AIR-1 was required for the localization of γ-TuRC to the centrosome, but not to the apical ncMTOC. Despite this, microtubules remained organized at the apical ncMTOC upon co-depletion of γ-TuRC and AIR-1. The authors also discovered that MZT-1/MZT1 was a novel protein that was essential in C . elegans and localized to both the centrosome and the apical ncMTOC. However, MZT-1 was only required for the localization of γ-TuRC to the PCM and not to the centriole or the apical ncMTOC. Furthermore, they found that the removal of other known microtubule regulators did not disrupt apical microtubule organization. Finally, the authors found that GIP-1 was only required for the localization of other γ-TuRC components to the apical ncMTOC and not to the centrosome. Together, these results suggest that ncMTOCs may be composed of distinct populations of γ-TuRC-dependent and γ-TuRC-independent microtubules.
Humans are diploid organisms with 23 chromosome pairs, inherited from the mother and father. Most human genomes are sequenced using laboratory methods that do not explicitly phase, or distinguish between the two copies of each chromosome pair. We compared 11 different approaches to phasing human genomes, including laboratory-based methods and computational methods. Our analyses suggest that a hybrid approach combining computational methods with population-based data provides a fast and efficient way to generate highly accurate phase-resolved genomes. We found that the inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can significantly reduce phasing errors. We also identified DNA sequence signatures associated with phasing switch errors, which can inform the choice of computational methods and sequence depth for phasing.
The flagellar type-III secretion system utilizes the energy of the proton motive force and ATP hydrolysis to energize substrate unfolding and translocation, which allows bacteria to move, adhere, and invade host cells. We found that this type-III secretion system can still function in the absence of ATPase activity by mutations that increased the proton motive force and flagellar substrate levels. This indicates that ATPase activity is not essential for type-III protein export and that the flagellar type-III secretion system can function in the absence of the virulence-associated type-III ATPase. Our findings suggest that type-III protein secretion systems are more complex than previously thought and have the ability to operate without ATPase activity.
Bistability, a property in which a system can be in one of two stable states, is found in many biological systems, such as those involved in cell fate specification and cell cycle regulation. However, identifying bistable network topologies is difficult because of the high number of uncertain parameters that need to be considered. Chemical reaction network theory (CRNT) is a mathematical framework that can identify bistable network topologies without knowledge of parameter values. We applied CRNT to reaction network models representing a broad class of small gene regulatory networks consisting of two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins. We found that 90% of the networks surveyed exhibited bistability, including 11 minimal networks. We further identified bistable modules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using experimental protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data. Our results suggest that bistability is a common property of biological systems and that CRNT can be used to identify bistable network topologies and predict their properties without knowledge of parameter values.
Orofacial clefting is a common birth defect that can result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The condition can lead to missing or malformed parts of the lip, palate, or both. Researchers have identified mutations in a gene called HYAL2 that may cause orofacial clefting. This gene encodes an enzyme that breaks down a molecule called hyaluronan, which is important for the development of the heart and palate. The researchers found that mutations in the HYAL2 gene caused the enzyme to become unstable, leading to a decrease in the amount of the enzyme in the body. This, in turn, may cause the palate to not close properly during development, leading to orofacial clefting. The researchers also found that the same mutations in mice caused similar issues with the heart and hearing, which are also present in some people with orofacial clefting.
The inner ear hair cells need tip links to detect sound, which are made of cadherin 23 (CDH23) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15). These links are subjected to sound-induced forces throughout an organism's life and can regenerate to restore hearing function. However, the molecular details of this process are unknown. In this study, researchers used a new microscopy technique to visualize the composition of these links, finding that they have at least two molecular compositions: PCDH15/CDH23 or PCDH15/PCDH15. The mature PCDH15/CDH23 composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of hearing function. This discovery provides a molecular mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells.
Dengue virus is the most common mosquito-borne virus, causing an estimated 100 million infections each year. These infections can range from mild dengue fever to more severe and potentially life-threatening forms of dengue hemorrhagic fever. At the critical phase of infection, around 5-7 days after the onset of fever, symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever become evident. However, the mechanisms that trigger the transition from dengue fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever at this stage are not well understood. To investigate these mechanisms, the authors analyzed the serum of adult dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever patients at the critical and recovery phases of infection using a technique called mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling. They found that 29 metabolites were differentially expressed between the two groups at the critical phase of infection, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. The authors also found that bile acids were significantly higher in the dengue hemorrhagic fever group and were associated with higher levels of liver enzymes, suggesting liver injury. Additionally, the authors found that uric acid, a natural antioxidant in the blood, was significantly lower in the dengue hemorrhagic fever group, which could lead to decreased antioxidant defense and increased oxidative stress. The authors concluded that their findings provide insights into the mechanisms of dengue hemorrhagic fever pathogenesis and may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets for dengue management.
Purine nucleotides are important in cellular metabolism, and a protein called GMPR helps convert GMP to IMP, which is needed to maintain the balance of purine nucleotides. While the function of GMPR has been studied in humans and bacteria, it hasn't been fully understood in parasitic protozoa such as Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African sleeping sickness. In this study, the authors identified GMPR in T. brucei and studied its function. They found that T. brucei GMPR was different from mammalian and bacterial GMPRs in that it had an insertion of a CBS domain, and it was influenced by monovalent cations, ribavirin, and purine nucleoside analogs. These findings suggest that the GMPR reaction in T. brucei is different from that in mammals and bacteria.
Sodium channels help in transmitting electrical signals in nerve cells. Drugs that block the activity of these channels are used to treat various diseases like epilepsy, pain, and arrhythmia. However, there is a lack of understanding about how these drugs work at the molecular level. Researchers used computer modeling to study the binding of two drugs, benzocaine and phenytoin, to the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac. They found that both drugs bind to two likely binding sites, one above the activation gate and one at the entrance to the lateral lipid-filled fenestrations. They also found that drugs can enter the channel through the fenestrations, which has long been proposed. The study provides important insights into the binding and action of these drugs at the molecular level.
The research article presents a study that investigates the role of MyD88 signaling in different cell types during intestinal infection with the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium. MyD88 signaling is important for activating immune responses against pathogens, but its cell type-specific contribution to the host response during intestinal infection is not well understood. To address this question, the researchers used a novel murine knock-in model that allows cell type-specific reactivation of functional MyD88 expression in otherwise MyD88-deficient mice. The study shows that functional MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ mononuclear phagocytes (MNP) is sufficient to activate innate immune responses and induce the early group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC3) response as well as the development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells in response to infection with C. rodentium. In contrast, restricting MyD88 signaling to other cell types, such as macrophages (MO), T cells or ILC3, did not induce efficient intestinal immune responses upon infection. The study also shows that functional expression of MyD88 in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) also partially protected the mice during intestinal infection, which was associated with enhanced epithelial barrier integrity and increased expression of the antimicrobial peptide RegIIIγ and the acute phase protein SAA1 by epithelial cells. Together, the results suggest that MyD88 signaling in DC and IEC is both essential and sufficient to induce a full spectrum of host responses upon intestinal infection with C. rodentium.
Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease that causes river blindness and is spread by blackfly bites. It can be eliminated through mass drug administration (MDA). The Ov16 antibody test is a diagnostic test used to determine if onchocerciasis transmission has been interrupted. This study used a mathematical model to analyze the relationship between the Ov16 antibody prevalence in children and the duration and coverage of MDA, mf prevalence in the population, and the probability of elimination. The study found that better understanding of the dynamics of Ov16 antibody responses is required for accurate interpretation of seroprevalence data and more precise estimation of the endpoint for MDA. The study also demonstrated that the endpoint for MDA will be dependent on baseline endemicity levels, which should be taken into account in guidelines for defining when to stop MDA.
Scientists have found that prion strains can change when they are grown in different environments. For example, when 22L prions were grown in cells in the presence of a drug called swainsonine, drug-resistant variants emerged. Scientists propose that prions are made up of many different types of prions that have different properties. They think that the fittest prions are the ones that survive in a particular environment. Scientists have found that prions become less resistant to swainsonine when they are grown in the absence of the drug. They also found that some prions that were originally swainsonine resistant became swainsonine sensitive when they were grown in cells for a long time. Scientists wanted to find out if it was possible to select for swainsonine-resistant prions even though RML prions, both when grown in the brain or in cells, are swainsonine sensitive. Scientists discovered that it was not possible to select swainsonine-resistant RML prions when they grew them in the PK1 cell line. However, in certain PK1 sublines, they were able to select swainsonine-resistant or even swainsonine-dependent populations. Once established, these populations could be grown indefinitely in PK1 cells in the absence of the drug. Scientists found that the misfolded prion protein associated with swainsonine-dependent prions was cleared more slowly in PK1 cells than the protein associated with swainsonine-sensitive prions. This suggests that likely structural differences of the misfolded prion protein are responsible for the properties of the prions. In summary, scientists have found that prions can adapt to their environment by changing their properties. These adaptations are likely due to changes in the structure of the misfolded prion protein.
In this study, the authors created a comprehensive map of all possible metabolisms that could potentially exist in a given set of environments. They used a computational method called flux balance analysis to predict the viability of each metabolism on each environment, and identified a total of 1024 different phenotypes. The authors found that viable metabolisms with any one phenotype typically form a single network of genotypes that extends far or all the way through genotype space. This suggests that evolutionary innovation in metabolisms is possible through small changes in genotype, and that the structure of metabolic genotype space is conducive to metabolic innovation. The authors suggest that this map could be used to study how changes in metabolic reactions lead to new metabolic phenotypes, and could also be used to identify new targets for drug development.
This study analyzes the genetic diversity and distribution of different haplogroups of Triatoma dimidiata, a vector of Chagas disease, across Mexico and Central America. It compares the genetic diversity and distribution of haplogroups 1, 2, and 3 to their different infection rates with Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite causing Chagas disease, and the prevalence of different Trypanosoma cruzi Discrete Typing Units (DTUs) within each haplogroup. The study also analyzes the population structure of the T. dimidiata complex at different scales, including landscape, sub-regional, regional, and continental levels. The study provides evidence that haplogroup 1 has a significant difference in the distribution of DTUI and DTUVI infections compared to haplogroup 2 and 3. It also provides evidence for differential T. cruzi infection frequency and DTU specificity among haplogroups, which is important for understanding the vector capacity of T. dimidiata haplogroups. Overall, the study highlights the importance of analyzing the genetic diversity and distribution of T. dimidiata haplogroups at different scales to better understand the dynamics of Chagas disease transmission.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a disease caused by a virus spread by rodents, such as rats and mice. This disease has occurred mainly in China, where it is a public health problem. In this study, researchers looked at the relationship between environmental factors, rodent species, and the occurrence of HFRS in Chenzhou, a city in Hunan Province, China. They used field surveillance data from rodent hosts for hantavirus, the environmental data from satellite images and meteorological stations, rodent-to-human transmission rates, and the impacts of the environment on the rodent community composition to determine this relationship. The study included 709 cases of HFRS. The researchers found that different rodent species played different roles across different land types. The rodent community composition was also associated with environmental variability. They also found that cultivated land was predicted to represent the highest risk for HFRS incidence. The study provides important information for the prevention and control of HFRS.
Costello syndrome (CS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by postnatal growth retardation, short stature, developmental delay, and an increased risk of tumors. The majority of CS cases are caused by a mutation in the HRAS gene, which encodes a protein that helps control cell growth. One particular mutation in the HRAS gene, p. Gly12Val, is known to cause a severe form of CS. In this study, the authors discovered a new mutation in the HRAS gene that was causing CS in a 12-year-old boy. They found that this mutation caused exon 2 of the HRAS gene to be skipped when the gene was being processed in the body. They also discovered that this skipping was due to the disruption of two splicing regulatory elements in exon 2. They confirmed this finding by using genetically engineered mice and human cells. The authors then went on to show that a different type of genetic alteration, a splice-switching oligonucleotide, could cause the same skipping of exon 2 in human cells. This oligonucleotide could potentially be used in the future as a therapy for treating certain types of cancers that are caused by mutations in the HRAS gene.
This study shows that a protein called METTL3 is important for the development of the cerebellum in mice. METTL3 is part of a complex that adds a chemical group called m6A to RNA molecules. This modification helps control how long RNA molecules last and how they are spliced. Without METTL3, the developing cerebellum is smaller and there is more cell death. This is likely because the RNA molecules in the developing cerebellum have extended lifetimes and are spliced incorrectly, leading to problems with cell differentiation and survival. This study highlights the importance of m6A modifications in the development of the central nervous system.
This study looked at transcription factors, proteins that turn genes on or off, and how they work together in embryonic stem (ES) cells. These stem cells are like blank slates that can turn into any kind of cell in the body. The study found that some transcription factors bind to the same parts of the DNA in ES cells and in early embryos. They also found that the combination of several transcription factors binding to a part of the DNA is more likely to turn a gene on than when just one transcription factor binds to it. The study also found that some parts of the DNA that transcription factors bind to are used to turn genes on in many different types of cells and at different stages of development. This suggests that these parts of the DNA are important for basic cell functions and may be harder to change. Overall, this study provides new insights into how transcription factors work together to regulate gene expression in ES cells and early embryos.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) can be caused by a genetic abnormality called a reciprocal translocation. This translocation creates a fusion protein called AML1/ETO that causes AML by preventing blood cells from maturing properly. The fusion protein also affects the function of another protein called AML1, which is needed for blood cell development. AML1/ETO may also work with another protein called HEB to cause AML. In this study, researchers used advanced lab techniques to analyze how AML1/ETO binds to DNA and affects the function of other proteins. They found that AML1/ETO binds to DNA in a way that is similar to AML1, but it also affects HEB in a way that helps it bind to DNA more efficiently. This finding provides a better understanding of how AML1/ETO causes AML and suggests that it may be important to consider both AML1 and HEB when developing treatments for this type of leukemia.
Scientists have discovered that a protein called histone acetyltransferase HAT2 in the parasite Leishmania donovani is essential for the survival of the parasite. HAT2 regulates gene expression by activating certain genes at specific stages of the cell cycle. These findings provide new insights into the gene regulation mechanisms in Leishmania parasites.
The study investigates how people infer on the intentions of others and how their decision-making process is influenced by these inferences. The researchers used computational modeling to analyze behavioral data from an economic game where two players interacted with each other. One player made a decision based on probabilistic information displayed in a pie chart, while the other player gave an additional recommendation to the first player. The incentives of the second player to give helpful or misleading advice changed over time, which required the first player to detect these changes and adapt their decision-making accordingly. The researchers identified two components in the players' decision-making process: (1) how players updated their beliefs about the reasons for the advisor's behavior, and (2) how these updated beliefs influenced their actual decisions. They created a set of 12 different models to represent these two components and fitted these models to the players' behavior using Bayesian model inversion. The study found that the players inferred on the volatility of the advisors' intentions and used this information to optimize their predictions about the validity of the advice. The players were more likely to rely on the advisor's recommendations when they believed the advisors' intentions were currently stable. The study also found that the players' interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) scores, explicit ratings of the advisors' helpfulness, and the advisors' self-reports on their chosen strategy were predicted by the Bayesian framework presented in the study. Overall, the results suggest that humans use a hierarchical generative model to infer on the changing intentions of others, use this information to inform decision-making in social interactions, and integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework presented in this study can be used to quantify individual differences in these mechanisms from simple behavioral readouts and may prove useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition.
Scrub typhus is a bacterial infection that is endemic in parts of Asia, including South Korea. It is usually a rural disease, but some cases have been seen in urban areas like Seoul. We found 88 cases of scrub typhus in Seoul between 2010 and 2013, and studied the clinical features of these patients. We also collected chigger mites from different locations in Seoul and found that the main vector of scrub typhus in the city is a type of chigger mite called Helenicula miyagawai. These mites were found in high numbers in the Gwanak mountain in southern Seoul. The patients who were infected with the bacteria that causes scrub typhus had mild clinical features. We identified the presence of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul, and recommend that this disease be considered as one of the differential febrile diseases and a target for prevention in non-endemic areas.
The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway is a natural defense mechanism against viruses and transposons in living organisms. In this process, small RNA (sRNA) molecules guide the Ago protein to its target RNA, leading to its degradation. The stability of sRNA molecules in RNAi pathways is regulated by a process called methylation. In this study, the authors describe the effects of a protein called HENN-1 on the different RNAi pathways in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that HENN-1 is involved in the 26G and 21U RNA pathways, but not the miRNA pathway. The stability of 21U RNA, the C. elegans piRNAs, is only mildly affected by loss of methylation, and introduction of artificial 21U target RNA does not further destabilize non-methylated 21U RNAs. In contrast, most 26G RNAs display reduced stability and respond to loss of HENN-1 by displaying increased 3′-uridylation frequencies. The authors also identified that specifically ERGO-1–bound 26G RNAs are modified by HENN-1, while ALG-3/ALG-4–bound 26G RNAs are not. The authors suggest that HENN-1 may be involved in the degradation of target RNA molecules by the Ago protein. They also found that loss of HENN-1 does not cause a significant change in global gene expression. However, the authors suggest that the effects on global gene expression are indirect and that HENN-1 may be involved in the process of RNAi. Overall, the study provides important insights into the function of the HENN-1 protein in the RNAi pathway.
This study investigates the role of Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and FUT8 in the human plasma N-glycan levels. It shows that HNF1α and its downstream target HNF4α regulate the expression of key fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes. The study also shows that HNF1α is necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells. These findings reveal a new role for HNF1α as a master transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in the fucosylation process. The mechanisms have implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, protein folding, and the development of cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders. Glycosylation is a process that adds sugars, such as fucose, to proteins, which can change the structure and function of the proteins. However, it is not directly encoded by genes and the processes that regulate it are poorly understood. This study provides new insights into the genetic regulation of glycosylation, which has implications for the treatment of various diseases.
Centromeres are important regions of the genome that help connect the genome to the cytoskeleton, allowing chromosomes to move on the spindle during cell division. In some organisms, including plants, centromeric DNA does not play a key role in organizing functional kinetochores. Instead, centromeres are marked by specific epigenetic features, including a histone H3 variant called Centromeric Histone H3 (CENH3) and RNA molecules that help recruit and stabilize CENH3. In this study, researchers looked at a protein called Centromere Protein C (CENPC) that has a key role in centromere recognition and maintenance. They found that a region within CENPC, called exon 9–12, is responsible for binding both DNA and RNA. They also showed that RNA helps facilitate the binding of CENPC to DNA in vitro. These findings suggest that CENPC and RNA are part of a template that helps direct CENH3 to newly replicated centromere DNA. This is important because it provides a biochemical mechanism for the involvement of RNA in centromere specification, and it suggests that CENH3 and CENPC work together in a self-reinforcing process to replicate the content and position of centromeres.
The article explores the role of the placenta in determining postnatal body size, which may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity. Researchers have identified variants associated with birth weight (BW), childhood obesity (CO) and childhood BMI (CBMI) through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Placenta eQTLs (gene expression quantitative trait loci) were then examined to determine if they contribute significantly to these anthropometry outcomes. The results showed that placental eQTLs are significantly enriched for BW, CO, and CBMI GWAS loci. Importantly, only placental eQTLs contribute significantly to both anthropometry outcomes at birth (BW) and childhood phenotypes (CO/CBMI). Eight, six, and one transcripts were found to colocalize with BW, CO, and CBMI risk loci, respectively. Overall, this study reveals that placental transcription in utero likely plays a key role in determining postnatal body size, and as such may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity.
The paper describes a study on post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a condition that occurs after successful treatment of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). PKDL is a skin condition that is not life-threatening but can be disfiguring, leading to social stigma for the affected individuals. The study was conducted in a VL-endemic area of West Bengal, India, to determine the prevalence of PKDL and to compare three methods for diagnosing PKDL: microscopic examination of skin lesions, rapid diagnostic test (RDT), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The study found a prevalence of PKDL of 27.5% among those who had previously been treated for VL. PCR was found to be the most sensitive method for diagnosing PKDL, followed by microscopic examination and RDT. The study also looked at the pattern of regression of skin lesions following treatment, and found that while some lesions disappeared quickly, others took longer and some even reappeared after 1.5 years. The study concludes that a combination of active surveillance and molecular testing is necessary to accurately diagnose PKDL and that a well-designed study with a larger sample size is needed to determine whether PKDL patients are still infected after treatment and to determine the optimal length of treatment.
This is an important paper about how bacteria can change their behavior in response to signals from other bacteria. The paper focuses on a bacterium called Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes pneumonia and other respiratory infections. The paper describes a system that allows bacteria to sense each other's presence and coordinate their behavior in response. This system is based on molecules called auto-inducers that are released by the bacteria and bind to their cells to activate certain genes. The paper explains how the bacteria use this system to coordinate their behavior in response to stress. It also describes how the bacteria use a system called competence to exchange genetic information. The paper explains how these two systems work together to allow bacteria to change their behavior in response to each other.
In this paper, the authors have developed a new method to study the process of translocation of HPV16 L2 protein from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the nucleus of the host cell. They used a system based on subcellular compartmentalization of the enzyme BirA and its cognate substrate to detect membrane translocation of L2-BirA from incoming virions. The authors found that L2 translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis. Cell cycle arrest causes retention of L2/vDNA at the TGN; only release and progression past G2/M enables translocation across the limiting membrane and subsequent infection. Microscopy of EdU-labeled vDNA revealed a rapid and dramatic shift in vDNA localization during early mitosis. At late G2/early prophase, vDNA egresses from the TGN to a pericentriolar location, accumulating there through prometaphase where it begins to associate with condensed chromosomes. By metaphase and throughout anaphase, the vDNA is seen bound to the mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into both daughter nuclei. Mutations in a newly defined chromatin binding region of L2 potently blocked translocation, suggesting that translocation is dependent on chromatin binding during prometaphase. These findings suggest that translocation is necessary for viral DNA to enter the nucleus and replicate, and that the tropism of HPV for mitotic basal keratinocytes is explained in part by the ability of HPV to functionally couple the penetration of limiting membranes to cellular mitosis.
The article presents a method to measure the transmissibility of one strain of a pathogen compared to another strain. This is important in several contexts, such as influenza strains competing for hosts in the human population, new influenza strains that have pandemic potential, and the potential impact of a neuraminidase inhibitor (NIA) on influenza transmission. The method is applied to data from experiments where animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains, and the mixture is observed over time and over multiple generations of transmission. The article demonstrates the method using ferret transmission studies and provides an estimate of the size of the transmitted inoculum. The article also suggests how to optimize experimental design for assessing transmissibility and provides a mathematical framework for capturing key characteristics of transmission. Finally, the article provides an estimate of the number of successfully infecting units transferred from the donor to recipient.
The plant hormone abscisic acid ( ABA ) plays an important role in plants' growth and development as well as their response to various environmental stresses. Plants use both light and ABA as signals to control how they grow and develop. However, it is not well understood how plants use these two signals together to better adapt and survive. In this study, we found that BBX21, a protein that helps plants grow and develop in response to light, is also involved in ABA signaling. Our genetic data show that BBX21 may act upstream of several ABA INSENSITIVE ( ABI ) genes and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 ( HY5 ), a protein that helps plants grow and develop in response to light. We further show that BBX21 negatively regulates ABI5 expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. In addition, ABI5 is a protein that directly activates its own expression. However, BBX21 negatively regulates this activity by directly interacting with ABI5. Our study shows that BBX21 helps plants coordinate the signals from light and ABA, and that BBX21, HY5, and ABI5 work together to help plants adapt and survive.
The Mediator is a complex of proteins that is associated with RNA polymerase II and is essential for transcription. The yeast Mediator has 25 subunits, which are organized into four modules: Head, Middle, Tail, and Kinase. The core Mediator (Head, Middle, and Tail) has a positive role in transcription, while the Kinase domain mainly functions in repression. Mediator interacts with gene-specific transcription factors and RNA polymerase II and mediates polymerase-activator interactions and formation of the pre-initiation complex. In addition to activated transcription, Mediator also stimulates basal transcription. Mediator subunits regulate adhesion in a distinct manner between yeasts S. cerevisiae and C. albicans.
The antibiotic resistance of bacteria in biofilms is much higher than that of their planktonic counterparts, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes many infections in humans. In this study, we used a complex, mixed population of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in biofilm and planktonic growth conditions, with and without tobramycin, to measure the contribution of each gene to antibiotic tolerance. We found that large sets of mutations contribute to antibiotic tolerance in the biofilm or planktonic state only. Our findings provide important insights into the differences between biofilm and planktonic antibiotic tolerance and offer a foundation for developing new therapeutics against biofilm-associated infections caused by P. aeruginosa.
Finding the best model to describe a complex system that has many interacting parts is difficult. There are many different ways to create such a model, and it can be hard to know which one is the best. Scientists often use mathematical models to help with this problem, but it can still be hard to decide which model is the best. In this paper, we present an algorithm called Flexible and Dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection (FAMoS) that can help with this problem. The algorithm works by searching through all the possible models and using a new method called non-local search to make sure that it doesn't get stuck in a local minimum. We tested the algorithm on simulated data and found that it works well and is flexible enough to handle different types of models. We also used the algorithm to analyze experimental data on the proliferation of T cells in different environments. We found that the proliferation of T cells is different in 2D suspension and 3D tissue-like cultures, which shows that our algorithm can find important differences in the data. Overall, our algorithm is a useful tool for data-driven analysis of complex systems.
Chagas disease is a severe illness caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. The National Program for Chagas Disease was implemented in Bolivia in 2006 to reduce the number of infections by controlling vectors. In 2012, the treatment with benznidazole (BNZ) was started in school-age children living in areas with certified vector control. In this study, we conducted a 12-month follow-up of these children and took seven blood samples. We used serology, conventional diagnostic PCR (cPCR), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to test the effectiveness of the treatment. We also analyzed the levels of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines. After 12 months, we found that approximately 11% of the children showed non-reactive results on both cPCR and qPCR, 42% showed ambiguous results, and 47% showed reactive results. We also found that the levels of IL-17A were significantly higher in seropositive children before the treatment compared to age-matched seronegative children. However, these levels decreased to normal levels one year after the treatment. Moreover, we found that IL-17A levels were positively correlated to parasite counts detected by qPCR. Finally, we found that IL-17A levels of non-reactive subjects were significantly higher than those of reactive or ambiguous subjects, suggesting that IL-17A might be a useful biomarker for determining the reactivity to BNZ treatment.
The article describes the Correia element, a type of miniature inverted repeat transposable element found in the genome of Neisseria meningitidis, a bacterium that causes bacterial meningitis and septicemia. The article explains that the Correia element is a type of transposon that is responsible for some of the genetic variation in the bacterium. The article describes the various ways in which the Correia element can change gene expression patterns and alter host physiology. The article also explains that the Correia element has the potential to act as a promoter for gene expression, and provides examples of genes that are transcribed from the Correia element. The article discusses the importance of understanding the function of the Correia element in order to better understand the pathogenesis of meningococcal disease.
In filamentous fungi, development and secondary metabolism are closely linked. Two proteins, VeA and LaeA, have been shown to be central to coordinating these processes in a handful of fungi, such as the Eurotiomycetes Aspergillus spp. and the Sordariomycetes Acremonium chrysogenum and Fusarium spp. VeA is a positive regulator of sexual development and a negative regulator of asexual development. LaeA is a negative regulator of secondary metabolite production. In this study, the orthologs of VeA and LaeA in the plant pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus, ChVel1 and ChLae1, were identified. Their mutants were constructed to study their role in secondary metabolism and virulence. It was found that ChVel1 and ChLae1 regulate T-toxin production, virulence to the host, and oxidative stress tolerance. They also positively regulate sexual development and repress asexual development and expression of melanin biosynthesis genes. However, their regulation of extracellular siderophore production was not altered. These findings suggest that ChVel1 and ChLae1 are key regulatory proteins in C. heterostrophus that coordinate secondary metabolism and virulence.
Researchers used computer simulations to study how ions move through the selectivity filter of bacterial NavAb channels. They discovered that two or three potassium ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter in the presence of an applied force pushing inward, but not when pushing outward. The block occurs in a local minimum on the free-energy landscape of two potassium ions. In contrast, three sodium ions can move together through the selectivity filter as a unit in a "knock-on" mechanism, and there is no local minimum for the block state of sodium ions. The researchers found that the work required to break the potassium block is equivalent to large applied potentials measured experimentally for bacterial Nav channels. This shows how including non-equilibrium factors in the simulations can provide more detailed information about ion selectivity mechanisms than crystal structures or equilibrium free-energy landscapes alone.
Rabies is a disease that affects the brain and is caused by a virus that spreads from animal to animal. There are two types of rabies: furious and paralytic. In furious rabies, the virus spreads rapidly to the brain, while in paralytic rabies, the virus spreads more slowly. To understand how the virus spreads in both forms of the disease, researchers have examined the brains of animals that have died from rabies. They have found that in paralytic rabies, there is less damage to the brain than in furious rabies. The researchers think that this may be because the virus spreads more slowly in paralytic rabies, giving the body time to respond and fight the infection before it gets to the brain.
Insulators are DNA sequences that regulate interactions between promoters and enhancers. They prevent inappropriate enhancer/promoter communication and are believed to play a key role in the genomic organization of transcriptional regulation. These insulators can be associated with the binding of certain proteins. In Drosophila, a protein called CTCF was recently identified as a new enhancer-blocking protein. The authors of this study used chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites in the Drosophila genome. They found that CTCF binding sites precisely match the locations of known insulator elements in the Bithorax complex. Furthermore, the authors identified three additional presumptive insulator elements based on the locations of CTCF binding sites between the regulatory regions of the Hox genes. They also found that the CTCF binding-site consensus sequence in Drosophila is similar to that found in vertebrates, which suggests that CTCF may have similar functions in both organisms. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the role of CTCF in regulating gene expression in Drosophila.
The authors of the study have provided a detailed mechanism for an induced-fit process at atomic resolution. They used a slow, tight binding inhibitor-enzyme system, actinonin-peptide deformylase, to capture intermediate conformations and final bound complexes. The authors have shown that the free enzyme is in an open conformation, and actinonin induces transition of the enzyme into a closed conformation. There is no evidence for the occurrence of a closed conformation in the apostructure of the open enzyme, which makes the closed form fully compatible with an induced-fit model. Moreover, using several rationally designed point mutants of the enzyme, ligand-induced intermediate states were trapped. These conformations recapitulate physical states that the WT enzyme must pass through during its overall transition from the apo-enzyme to the E:I* complex. The authors propose that induced fit also contributes to efficient catalysis.
The thalamus is an important brain region that relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex. Most of the information that enters the thalamus comes from the sensory organs, but there is also feedback from the cortex to the thalamus. This feedback is thought to be important for controlling the overall gain and filtering of sensory information as it passes through the thalamus. However, the exact mechanisms by which the feedback from the cortex affects the thalamus are not well understood. In this study, we used computer simulations and experiments to study the impact of cortical feedback on the transfer of sensory information through the thalamus. We found that the transfer efficiency of sensory information depends on three main factors: the number of thalamic cells involved in the processing, the statistics of the cortical input, and the level of correlation between thalamic cells. Our results suggest that the transfer efficiency of thalamic cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. This finding could have important implications for understanding how attention and awareness affect the processing of sensory information in the brain.
The biological roles of methylation beyond at the C5-position of cytosines in CpG dinucleotides are not well understood. We have found that the putative DNA demethylase NMAD-1 plays a critical role in regulating meiosis in C. elegans. NMAD-1 mutants have reduced fertility due to defective chromosomal segregation. We have also found that nmad-1 mutant worms have disorganized nuclear staging, and mislocalized cohesin complex at the diplotene and diakinesis stages, and improperly condensed, fused, or lost by the end of diakinesis. The RNA sequencing of nmad-1 germline revealed reduced induction of DNA replication and DNA damage response genes during meiosis, which was coupled with delayed DNA replication, impaired DNA repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing oocytes. Moreover, the majority of TOP-2 binding to chromatin depends on NMAD-1. These results suggest that NMAD-1 functions at DNA replication sites to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common and harmful virus that can cause disabilities in newborns and serious health problems in people with weakened immune systems. In order to understand how HCMV infection works, scientists have looked for cellular proteins that help the virus infect cells. In this study, they found a new protein called adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) that is important for HCMV infection in both epithelial cells (such as skin cells) and fibroblasts (such as lung cells). The researchers discovered that APMAP helps HCMV enter cells by interacting with glycoprotein complexes on the virus and transporting the virus into the cell. The researchers also found that APMAP is needed for the virus to take over the cell's machinery and make new viruses. This study provides new information about how HCMV infection works and may help scientists develop new ways to prevent or treat the virus.
Scientists have developed a model to understand how lineage commitment decisions are made in hematopoiesis. They have found that cytokines can have a strong influence on lineage commitment decisions by providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment. This is achieved through positive receptor feedback loops that induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation. The researchers have used a minimal model that combines cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic elements of regulation to understand how both instructive and stochastic events can inform cell commitment decisions in hematopoiesis. The results of the study support both the instructive and stochastic theories of commitment.
The Bunyaviridae family contains many viruses with RNA genomes and are divided into five genera: Hantavirus, Orthobunyavirus, Nairovirus, Phlebovirus, and Tospovirus. Over 350 bunyaviruses have been identified and many of them are zoonotic and have emerged as major human pathogens. Oropouche virus (OROV) causes Oropouche fever, La Crosse virus (LACV) causes severe encephalitis and aseptic meningitis mostly in children, and Schmallenberg virus (SBV) causes severe and often fatal infections in newborn sheep, cattle, and goats.
Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, particularly in Asia. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS), three strongly associated genetic variants were identified: rs11024102 in PLEKHA7, rs3753841 in COL11A1, and rs1015213 located between PCMTD1 and ST18 on Chromosome 8q. These variants explained less than 2% of PACG risk, so we looked into other methods to identify more genes that underlie PACG susceptibility. We chose to study smaller anterior segment dimensions, which are a hallmark of PACG, with a focus on anterior chamber depth (ACD), the cardinal feature associated with increased susceptibility to PACG. Eyes with an ACD of less than 2.8 mm are more likely to develop angle closure and glaucomatous optic neuropathy. ACD is a quantitative trait that displays high heritability and can be considered an endophenotype for PACG. We conducted a genome-wide association study on a total of 5,308 individuals of Asian descent and identified a sequence variant within ABCC5 (rs1401999) associated with an increase in risk of PACG. This association was strengthened when a sub-group of controls with open angles were included in the analysis. Our findings suggest that genetic variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions may play a role in PACG risk.
We have identified two examples of cis-regulatory elements conserved between deuterostomes (humans, mice, and zebrafish) and protostomes (sea urchin, owl limpet, and sea hare). These elements were identified through a comparative analysis of human and mouse cis-regulatory elements to all available bilaterian genomes. By comparing the regulatory sequences of known transcription factor binding sites, we identified two examples of conserved enhancers that drive the expression of developmental genes in both deuterostomes and protostomes. These elements were then tested through transient transgenic enhancer assays in zebrafish and sea urchin, confirming their function as enhancers in both clades. Overall, our study provides the first examples of conserved regulatory elements between deuterostomes and protostomes, highlighting the conservation of developmental regulatory circuits throughout evolution.
Influenza viruses are constantly changing and evolving, leading to new strains that are different from the ones seen before. Influenza vaccines are designed to protect against these new strains, but they are not always effective. The study looked at influenza A virus in humans and found that vaccine-induced immunity had little impact on the intrahost diversity of influenza virus in natural infection. This means that vaccine-induced immunity may not be a major contributor to antigenic drift at local scales.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a severe and often fatal disease caused by the Leishmania parasite. It can be difficult to treat and a new vaccine is needed. Previously, we showed that live attenuated LdCen-/- parasites induced a strong protective innate and adaptive immune response in young mice. In this study, we investigated the immune response in aged mice infected with LdCen-/- parasites. We found that LdCen-/- parasites induced strong innate and adaptive immune responses in both young and aged mice, but the adaptive response was lower in the aged mice. Despite this, LdCen-/- immunization was still protective against virulent L. donovani infection in the aged mice, but not as effectively as in young mice. Our results suggest that LdCen-/- immunization can be a promising vaccine candidate for VL, even in aged populations.
The article describes a study that aimed to investigate the underlying causes of the differences in biophysical and clinical properties between enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs). The authors generated chimeras at the capsid-level between EV-D68 (a respiratory EV) and EV-D94 (an enteric EV), and performed functional assays to determine the role of capsid proteins in determining acid sensitivity, optimal growth temperature, tissue tropism, and innate immune response. The study showed that capsid proteins are important determinants of these key properties of EVs, and that these proteins can be exchanged between different EV species to generate chimeric viruses with unique properties. These findings could aid in the development of antiviral treatments or vaccines for EVs.
In this article, researchers investigated the fate of an antibody (IgG) that was bound to a viral antigen on the surface of HSV-1-infected cells. The researchers found that the antibody-antigen complex was endocytosed with gE-gI, a transmembrane Fc receptor on the surface of infected cells. Once inside the cells, the antibody-antigen complex dissociated from gE-gI at acidic pH, resulting in lysosomal localization of the antigen. This finding suggests that gE-gI may help HSV-1 evade IgG-mediated immune responses by clearing host IgG and viral antigens from the cell surface.
The aim of this study was to investigate the secretome of E. granulosus PSCs, a pathogenic stage of this parasite that is responsible for causing cystic hydatid disease in humans. We found that the secretome of PSCs is highly diverse and contains a wide range of ESPs. Many of these ESPs are involved in metabolic processes, such as glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and protein degradation, suggesting that PSCs may rely on these pathways to adapt to the host environment. Additionally, we identified a number of ESPs that are involved in immune regulation, including several that target the host immune system. These findings suggest that ESPs released by PSCs may play a role in the pathogenesis of CHD and could be potential targets for intervention.
In this study, the researchers found that the oxidation of a specific methionine residue in a protein called NirA in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans can affect the transcriptional competence of the protein. Specifically, when NirA is in its active form and in the presence of nitrate, this methionine residue is oxidized, which leads to its nuclear export and a loss of transcriptional activity. However, in the absence of nitrate, this methionine residue remains reduced, allowing NirA to be active and to remain in the nucleus. The researchers propose that a central domain of NirA interacts with a C-terminal activation domain, which regulates the accessibility of the NES based on the oxido-reduction status of the methionine residue.
Sodium channels are important for our bodies to function properly, and they need to have very specific properties to work properly. These properties are determined by their genes. In this article, we analyze the genes for nine different types of sodium channels in mammals and find that they have very similar properties. We suggest that this is because the properties of these channels need to be very specific to work properly. We also find that the different types of sodium channels are adapted to work in different parts of the body. These findings help us understand how these channels evolved to have the specific properties they do.
A new structure-based approach is being used to develop antiviral drugs targeting influenza virus polymerase, which is a protein found in the nucleus of infected cells and is responsible for replicating and transcribing the single-stranded RNA genome of the virus. The cap-snatching mechanism of the polymerase involves the binding of host cell pre-mRNAs with their 5′ cap structure to the PB2 subunit, followed by the cleavage of the pre-mRNAs by the endonuclease activity of the PA subunit. The short capped oligomers then serve as primers for transcription of the viral mRNAs. The endonuclease domain of the PA subunit was studied using X-ray crystallography to determine its structure in complex with four different inhibitors, including 2 , 4-dioxobutanoic acid compounds and a green tea catechin. These compounds are reported to have IC50s in the range of 20 to 30 µM and have been shown to directly inhibit the endonuclease activity of the polymerase, thus stalling viral transcription and replication. The structures provide in detail how these compounds bind directly to the metal ions in the active site and interact with a number of residues in the active site, some of which change conformation upon ligand binding. This three-dimensional knowledge of the ligand interacting residues and the regions of plasticity of the active site is critical for the optimised design of modifications to existing inhibitors or for the structure-based design and optimisation of novel inhibitors that effectively block endonuclease activity.
The study aimed to create polyspecific antivenom for three medically important snakes that cause a lot of harm in Asia. To achieve this, four horses were immunized with a mixture of the venoms from the three snakes. The antisera produced from these immunizations neutralized the toxins of the three snakes and had much higher potency than the QSMI monospecific antisera. This protocol can be used to produce potent polyspecific antisera against other snake species as well.
A recent paper from my lab has discovered that a protein called SseI is required for Salmonella to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. This protein, which is part of a type of protein called a secreted effector, is translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system ( T3SS ). The SseI protein binds to a host protein called IQGAP1, which helps regulate cell movement. By inhibiting normal cell migration, SseI helps the Salmonella to stay inside the host cells and avoid being killed. The paper also found that SseI reduced the migration of DC (dendritic cells) in the spleen in vivo, which reduced the number of DC and CD4+ T cells in the spleen. This is a novel mechanism by which an intracellular pathogen manipulates host cell migration to dampen the ability of the host to clear systemic bacteria.
Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a type of S. aureus that causes severe diseases in healthy people, and is more virulent than hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). The exact cause of this increased virulence is unknown. In this study, researchers have discovered that the psm-mec gene, located in a mobile genetic element called SCCmec of HA-MRSA, but not in CA-MRSA, produces a type of RNA that suppresses the expression of agrA, a positive transcription factor for the PSMα gene, which encodes a cytolytic toxin. The researchers found that 25% of 325 clinical MRSA isolates had a mutation in the psm-mec promoter that attenuated transcription, and 9% had no psm-mec at all. In most of these strains, the absence of psm-mec caused an increase in PSMα expression compared to strains carrying an intact psm-mec. Deleting psm-mec from HA-MRSA strains carrying an intact psm-mec increased the expression of AgrA protein and PSMα, and virulence in mice. These findings suggest that the psm-mec gene suppresses MRSA virulence by inhibiting agrA translation, and the absence of this gene in CA-MRSA contributes to its high virulence.
The study aimed to develop an animal model for dengue virus (DENV) infection that would recreate the enhanced disease severity observed in humans when they are born to DENV-immune mothers and subsequently infected with a heterologous or homologous DENV serotype. The study used type I IFN-receptor-deficient A129 mice, which have an intact IFNγ signaling pathway. 5-week-old A129 mice born to DENV1-immune mothers were infected with DENV2, resulting in enhanced disease severity characterized by death, increased viremia, and severe liver damage. Anti-TNFα therapy protected the mice from the enhanced disease severity, while blocking IL-6 did not impact the virus titers or disease outcome. The study suggests that the A129 mouse model could be used to evaluate the efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates for dengue.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease that affects humans and animals and is caused by a parasite called Leishmania infantum (syn. Leishmania chagasi). In the Americas, VL is a zoonosis that is transmitted to humans by sandflies. Sandflies are the main vector of the parasite, and some other animals, such as dogs, foxes, and opossums, are also potential reservoirs of the disease. Humans who are exposed to the disease can develop a range of symptoms, from asymptomatic forms to severe visceral involvement, with a fatal outcome in some cases. The diagnosis of VL is usually made through delayed hypersensitivity tests, such as the Montenegro skin test, or immunological techniques, such as the Indirect fluorescent antibody test, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or the direct agglutination test. There is a lack of effective surveillance systems in most countries, which makes it difficult to estimate the burden of the disease. Despite the limited information about the risk factors for VL, some factors have been identified that are associated with infection by Leishmania infantum. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 studies conducted in the Americas found that male sex, younger age, and the presence of dogs at home were associated with VL in humans. However, the results of the studies varied widely, and there is a need for more research to better understand the factors associated with VL and to develop more effective and well-targeted control measures.
The paper is about a type of bacteria called Francisella tularensis that can cause a very serious form of pneumonia called acute pulmonary tularemia. The paper suggests that the immune system's response to the bacteria plays a key role in determining whether someone will survive or die. The authors found that the immune system's response to the bacteria can lead to the failure of immune cells to properly function, which can cause damage to the lungs and ultimately lead to death. They suggest that this failure may be due to the presence of immature immune cells, which are not able to properly fight the bacteria. They also found that mice that are transferred with specific immune cells are more likely to die from the infection. These findings may have important implications for understanding how to treat people with this type of infection.
The Asian tiger mosquito (Ae. albopictus) is an invasive species that has spread rapidly around the world, potentially due to the transportation of mosquito eggs by humans. This mosquito species is a vector of medically important viruses, including chikungunya (CHIKV), dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV), which can cause serious health problems in humans. In this study, we combined classical population genetics analyses and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approaches to infer the demographic history of Ae. albopictus populations from representative countries in the Southeast Asian native range and in more recently colonized areas. By examining the genetic makeup of these populations, we were able to identify the origins of Ae. albopictus populations from Southeast Asia (China, Thailand, and Japan), the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Basin, the Pacific Ocean islands, and North America. Our findings can help predict the risk of vector outbreaks and inform efforts to mitigate the spread of this invasive species.
Scientists have been studying the process of acute infection, which is when a bacterial pathogen enters the body and causes a rapid infection. However, much less is known about chronic infections. These are infections that can last for months or years and do not spread to other parts of the body. In this study, scientists wanted to understand what genes and functions make Pseudomonas aeruginosa fit to survive in chronic wound infections. They found that clinical isolates from human chronic wounds were often missing some of the genes that help the bacteria cause infections and form biofilms. However, many other genes that help the bacteria make energy and survive in low oxygen environments were important for their survival in wounds. These findings may help scientists develop new treatments for chronic infections.
Bancroftian filariasis is a mosquito-borne parasitic disease that affects approximately 100 million people worldwide. It is estimated that 40 million of these people suffer from the chronic disfiguring manifestations of this disease, including 27 million men with testicular hydrocele, lymph scrotum, or elephantiasis of the scrotum. Hydrocele is the most frequent clinical manifestation of bancroftian filariasis. In tropical and subtropical regions, up to 40% of adult males are reported to have testicular hydrocele. The genital pathology caused by bancroftosis is impressively debilitating and economically punishing for huge numbers of adult males throughout endemic countries. The mechanism behind the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the vaginal cavity of the testicle, known as acquired hydrocele, is unbalanced between the secretory and absorptive functions of the layers of the tunica vaginalis. Surgery using different techniques is the standard treatment form for chronic hydrocele, regardless of the etiology. However, the goal of the surgery is to expose the secretory surface of the tunica vaginalis to the absorbing surface of the scrotal wall. In this study, researchers evaluated the occurrence of lymphangiectasia in the scrotal contents, the morphology and consistency of the testicles, and hydrocele recurrence using the complete excision of the tunica vaginalis in hydrocele patients living in a bancroftian filariasis endemic area.
Trichinella spiralis is a parasitic nematode that causes trichinellosis, a disease that affects all continents except Antarctica. During chronic infection, T. spiralis larvae infect skeletal myofibres, disrupting their differentiation state. An activity-based probe, HA-Ub-VME, was used to identify deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activity in lysate of T. spiralis L1 larvae. Results were analysed by immuno-blot and immuno-precipitation, identifying a number of potential DUBs. Immuno-precipitated proteins were subjected to LC/MS/MS, yielding peptides with sequence homology to 5 conserved human DUBs: UCH-L5, UCH-L3, HAUSP, OTU 6B, and Ataxin-3. The predicted gene encoding the putative UCH-L5 homologue, TsUCH37, was cloned and recombinant protein was expressed and purified. The deubiquitinating activity of this enzyme was verified by Ub-AMC assay. Co-precipitation of recombinant TsUCH37 showed that the protein associates with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including the yeast Rpn13 homologue ADRM1. In addition, the UCH inhibitor LDN-57444 exhibited specific inhibition of recombinant TsUCH37 and reduced the viability of cultured L1 larvae. This study reports the identification of the first T. spiralis DUB, a cysteine protease that is putatively orthologous to the human protein, hUCH-L5. Results suggest that the interaction of this protein with the proteasome has been conserved throughout evolution. This family of enzymes in T. spiralis may be important for the survival of the parasite and similar inhibitory compounds may provide useful tools for further investigating the role of the Ub/proteasome system in T. spiralis infection.
A study was conducted to find new drugs to treat Chagas disease, a tropical disease caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. The parasite is transmitted through the bites of a type of bug. Current treatments for Chagas disease can cause side effects and are only effective during the acute phase of the disease. A protein called cruzipain is a target for new drug development because it is important for the life cycle of the parasite and can be targeted by drugs. The study tested three compounds based on two different types of scaffolds to see how well they worked as drugs. The two compounds that worked the best were tested against the parasite and against a protein called cruzain, a form of cruzipain that is easier to study. It was found that the two best compounds worked better against the parasite than against cruzain, suggesting that they have a polypharmacological profile, meaning they work on more than one thing at the same time. This is good news because it means that the drugs will likely work better in the body.
We report the construction of a high-resolution physical map of the maize genome. We used a combination of different sequencing, mapping, and assembly techniques to create the map. The map was anchored to genetic markers and is composed of 523 BAC contigs representing 244.9 Mb of the genome. We also developed a software tool to compare our physical map with the rice genome, which allowed us to identify 52 major collinear blocks between the two genomes. Our analysis suggests that the progenitors of maize had 10 chromosomes, which underwent breakage and fusion to form the 10 maize chromosomes after allotetraploidization. We also identified 28 homoeologous regions in the maize genome and predicted their ancestral chromosomal structure. Our results provide new insights into the evolution of the maize genome and its ancestral genomes.
The article describes a new method to create infectious protein particles in the lab that mimic a disease that affects the brain called spongiform encephalopathies. These protein particles are called prion proteins and are responsible for this disease. The method, called protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), has been used to create infectious prion proteins in the past. However, the authors wanted to see if it was possible to create these particles without using brain samples as the starting material. They used PMCA to create new prion proteins in the lab and then tested them on animals to see if they caused disease. The authors found that they could create new prion proteins in the lab and these proteins were infectious when injected into animals. This new method provides a way to study the proteins that cause spongiform encephalopathies without needing to use brain samples, which can be difficult to obtain.
We present a new type of neural model that estimates the angular velocity (AV) of a bee while flying. This model is different from the previously known model for visual odometry and corridor-centering. Our model fits electrophysiological data and is tested against behavioral data. We found that the AV response can be considered an extension to the optomotor response. We tested the model's performance in a virtual environment against data from real experiments.
The paper reports the outcome of infection by a parasite called Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, which causes sleeping sickness. It was previously thought that the only outcome was death, but this study used new and specific tests to follow 50 people in Ivory Coast who had been diagnosed with sleeping sickness in 1995-1996. Of these 50 people, 11 refused treatment. Out of these 11 people, 10 were found to be free of parasites in the blood using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 2009. Seven out of these 10 people were also found to have decreasing levels of antibodies to the parasite in 2009, meaning they had become "tolerant" to the parasite. This study shows that alternative progressions of sleeping sickness are possible, including a "parasite-free" and "asymptomatic" infection, and a "spontaneous resolution" of the infection. These findings are important because they suggest that human "trypanotolerance" may exist, and that further research is needed to understand this phenomenon.
The relationship between ionizing radiation and the development of cancer is not well understood. Some researchers suggest that radiation-induced mutations may not be the only factor involved. Instead, radiation may also lead to the selection of p53-deficient cells, which have a survival advantage in response to radiation-induced stress. This selection can lead to greater expansion of p53-deficient cells and an increased risk of lymphoma development. This study found that ionizing radiation led to the selection of p53-deficient cells and an increased risk of lymphoma development.
Helminth parasites, including schistosomes, have been shown to protect against inflammatory diseases in humans and animal models. However, the mechanisms behind this protection are not well understood. In this study, we investigate the role of a specific protein called SmKI-1 in schistosome development and inflammatory disease protection. We found that SmKI-1 inhibits neutrophil migration and function by blocking neutrophil elastase activity, a protease involved in inflammation. We also showed that SmKI-1 is essential for schistosome survival in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that SmKI-1 may be a promising therapeutic molecule for treating inflammatory diseases.
The article describes a new method for predicting the 3D structure of large proteins that are embedded in cell membranes. These proteins are called eukaryotic transmembrane helical (TMH) proteins and perform important functions in cells, but their structures are difficult to characterize because they are embedded in cell membranes. The new method is based on comparing the protein to other proteins that have similar functions, and then making changes to the structure of the protein to improve its accuracy. The method has been tested in two blind prediction contests and in a benchmark of 50 different protein pairs. The results show that the method can significantly improve starting templates, and achieve near-atomic accuracy in predicting membrane-embedded regions. The method should be useful for designing new proteins with novel functions for use in systems/synthetic biology applications.
In this study, researchers found that Listeria monocytogenes, a bacteria that causes the foodborne illness listeriosis, has a new survival strategy during infection. When in human hepatocytes or trophoblast cells, L. monocytogenes switches from its active, motile lifestyle to a stage of persistence in vacuoles. This stage allows bacteria to survive in the host without causing disease, which may explain why listeriosis is relatively rare despite being ubiquitous in the environment. Researchers discovered this stage by studying the effects of gentamicin on infected cells, and found that high doses of gentamicin did not trigger the formation of LisCVs but selected for vacuolar and VBNC bacteria. Together, these results provide new insights into the ability of L. monocytogenes to evade the host's immune system and persist in the body.
The study investigates how the brain processes sequences of different tones that are organized in repeating ABA-triplets and how our perception of these triplets can change over time. The study combines neuromechanistic modeling and psychoacoustic experiments to investigate the nature of these changes and to characterize the effects of manipulating stimulus parameters. The model used in the study is designed to mimic the way neurons in the brain process the different tones in the ABA-triplets, and the model predicts that manipulating the frequency difference between the two tones should affect the dominance of the stronger percept. The study confirms the predictions of the model through behavioral experiments and further refines the model to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The results of the study provide a platform that can be extended to consider other stimulus conditions.
The study aims to find out the antigens that cause allergic reactions in people with schistosomiasis. This will be done by using a wheat germ lysate translation system to quickly make parasite proteins, which will then be tested for allergic reactions using a human basophil cell line. The results of this study can help researchers understand how allergies to parasites work and how to make better vaccines.
The paper you are referring to is an interesting study about the effects of transposable elements (TEs) on the reproductive success of hybrid organisms. The authors of the study show that TEs can be activated in the offspring of hybrid crosses, causing germline damage and sterility. The activation of TEs can occur when the TE families present in the father's genome are not matched with a corresponding pool of corresponding TE silencing piRNAs provided by the mother. The authors used the D . virilis syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis as a model to study the effects of divergence in the TE profile between parents on offspring. They found that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germline TE expression when comparing genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses and these differences are transmitted to the next generation. Moreover, the authors found that chronic and persisting TE expression coincides with increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. The authors also showed that gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents that arise through polymorphic TE insertions. Overall, these results support a model in which early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of both TE and gene expression in the germline that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of TEs in reproductive isolation and the evolution of species.
Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic condition characterized by mental retardation. It is caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene. The FXTAS variant of FXS is characterized by movement problems, such as tremors and ataxia, as well as cognitive impairment. It is caused by a repeat of three nucleotides, CGG, that results in the production of an abnormal form of the FMR1 protein. In FXTAS, the CGG repeat is smaller than in FXS, which results in the production of some normal protein, but the repeat is still large enough to cause problems. It is thought that the abnormal RNA produced by the CGG repeat is responsible for the symptoms of FXTAS. However, the mechanism by which the RNA is produced in greater quantities is unknown. Here, researchers used fruit flies and human cells to study the mechanism by which the CGG repeat leads to greater production of the abnormal RNA. They found that the CGG repeat causes changes in the structure of the DNA and the surrounding proteins in the nucleus, which in turn lead to increased production of the abnormal RNA. They also found that drugs that can alter the structure of the DNA and the surrounding proteins can reduce the production of the abnormal RNA. These results provide new insights into the causes of FXTAS and suggest that drugs that can alter the structure of DNA and the surrounding proteins could be used to treat this condition.
Chronic viral infections, such as HIV and HCV, affect millions of people worldwide. Host genetic factors can impact the immune response and viral clearance. Studies have shown that certain HLA class I alleles or specific HLA alleles (HLA B*5701 and HLA B*2701) can enhance CD8 T cell responses and reduce viral loads during HIV infection. Similarly, HLA alleles have also been associated with clearance of HCV infection. In both humans and animal models, the ability to maintain a functional CD8 T cell response is critical to controlling viral replication. However, constant CD8 T cell stimulation during chronic viral infection can lead to CD8 T cell exhaustion, where antiviral CD8 T cells lose their effector functions and prevent effective clearance of infection. CD4 T cells also play a crucial role in controlling viral infection. During chronic viral infection, CD4 T cells can convert from a Th1 phenotype to a Tfh phenotype, which is not critical for viral clearance. Murine models have been used to study the contribution of MHC alleles versus host genetic background on mouse strain susceptibility to infection. In this study, the contribution of MHC alleles versus host genetic background was examined during chronic LCMV Cl-13 infection. The results indicate that increasing MHC diversity allows for a broader CD8 T cell response that can more rapidly control viral infection. However, F1 mice with a H-2bxd haplotype on different genetic backgrounds exhibited differences in CD8 T cell exhaustion and CD4 T cell subset distribution, resulting in differences in viral control and disease susceptibility. Unexpectedly, H-2bxd mice on a C57BL background succumbed to LCMV Cl-13 infection in a T-cell- and IFN-γ-dependent manner. Thus, both MHC haplotype and genetic background together influence host resistance to CD8 T cell exhaustion and disease susceptibility following LCMV Cl-13 infection.
Anthrax is a serious disease caused by a bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. It mainly affects animals, but it can also cause problems in humans. Anthrax is widespread in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America, and it is considered a global public health threat due to its potential use for bioterrorism. In China, anthrax is more common in northern and western provinces, such as Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Qinghai. To better understand the genetic diversity of B. anthracis in China, researchers analyzed 106 strains from these provinces using two different methods: canonical single-nucleotide polymorphisms (canSNP) and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). They found five different sublineages of B. anthracis in northwestern China, including A . Br . 001/002 , A . Br . Vollum , A . Br . Aust94 , A . Br . Ames and A . Br . 008/009 , and all of these sublineages were found in Xinjiang province. The strains collected from anthrax outbreaks in recent years were classified into three different subgroups: A . Br . 001/002 and A . Br . Ames. The researchers also found that the geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations in northwestern China is gradually becoming more balanced. Their findings provide important information for preventing and controlling anthrax in China.
The article describes how a protein called resistin-like molecule (RELM) beta, which is produced by a type of gut cell called goblet cells, helps defend the gut against infection by the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium. When the bacterium infects the gut, it causes the goblet cells to produce more RELM beta, which then attracts immune cells to the infected area to fight the infection. The article also describes how RELM beta promotes the growth of new gut cells, which helps replace the old ones that were infected by the bacteria and are no longer able to function. Without RELM beta, the immune response to the infection was reduced, and the infected cells died off more quickly, which led to more severe damage in the gut.
The paper discusses the process of translation initiation in positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the Caliciviridae family, such as Norovirus. These viruses use a non-canonical mechanism of translation initiation, bypassing the usual step of binding to the cap-binding protein eIF4E. Instead, they use the large C-terminal fragment of eIF4G to initiate translation of their RNA. The paper presents evidence that murine norovirus (MNV) VPg binds to the middle fragment of eIF4G (4GM) via a conserved stretch of ~20 amino acids at the C terminus of MNV VPg. The authors used a combination of pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal titration calorimetry to demonstrate this interaction. They also found that the MNV VPg-eIF4G interaction is non-overlapping with the binding site for eIF4A on eIF4G. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of norovirus translation initiation and identify a potential target for antiviral drug development.
Gene clusters are groups of related genes found on a bacterial chromosome. Different theories have been proposed to explain how and why these clusters form. These include the selfish operon model, which suggests that clustered genes are more easily transferred between species, and the persistence model, which states that clustering helps prevent the disruption of genes. A new computational model has been developed to study how gene clusters can evolve, and it has found that clustering is most likely to occur when there are few genes, a large population, and a high rate of horizontal gene transfer. The selfish operon model is still a plausible explanation for the evolution of gene clusters, although it requires certain conditions to be met.
Malaria is a serious illness caused by parasites that infect red blood cells. These parasites bind to specific receptors in the body to cause different diseases, including cerebral malaria and pregnancy associated malaria (PAM). PAM is a dangerous condition that affects pregnant women and their fetuses. The parasites that cause PAM bind to a different type of receptor than those that cause other malaria diseases, called chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). This binding happens in the placenta, which causes massive sequestration of infected red blood cells in this organ. The parasite-encoded variant surface antigen VAR2CSA is responsible for binding to CSA. This antigen is unique because it is the only one that binds to CSA and it is found in almost all parasite strains. In non-pregnant individuals, there are high levels of antibodies that react with VAR2CSA. However, in pregnant women, there are high levels of antibodies that react with VAR2CSA only in women who have previously been pregnant. This suggests that VAR2CSA might be subject to a unique regulatory mechanism that does not apply to the rest of the VAR gene family. Recent studies have shown that there is a unique 5′ regulatory region called UpsE that contains a 360 bp upstream open reading frame (uORF) that ends 269 bp 5′ of the translational start site. This uORF is conserved across P. falciparum isolates and in P. reichenowi, indicating that it is under similar selection pressure as the rest of the gene. uORFs have recently emerged as novel regulators of eukaryotic translation, acting as repressors of protein synthesis via several different mechanisms. The presence of a uORF in the 5′ untranslated region of VAR2CSA suggests that this element might function to prevent translation of VAR2CSA mRNA in situations where the ligand for the encoded PfEMP1 is not available. To test this hypothesis, researchers used reporter gene constructs in transiently transfected and stably transformed parasites to show that the uORF indeed represses mRNA translation. However, they also showed that it is possible to select parasites that have reversed this repression and actively translate the mRNA. These data suggest that an additional level of regulation controls expression of the PfEMP1 variant associated with pregnancy associated malaria, perhaps to prevent its expression at times when no placenta is available for binding.
Dengue viruses can cause different severity levels of the disease, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening shock and hemorrhagic fever. Host responses may be the cause of different severity levels of dengue infection, and these host responses can be reflected in the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells. In this study, we compared the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood from 34 children with different severity levels of dengue infection in Nicaragua. We found that the transcriptional profiles of dengue patients with shock were distinct from those with hemorrhagic fever, and that the profiles of dengue patients with hemorrhagic fever were distinct from those with dengue fever. We also conducted a meta-analysis of our dataset and other existing datasets of dengue expression profiling to identify common themes and differences. Our findings provide important insights into the different severity levels of dengue infection and could be used to improve the prediction of disease manifestations.
A recent study by the authors investigates how viruses infect new hosts. They used a natural parasite of mice, Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), which is closely related to the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV). The authors discovered that MuHV-4 binds to heparan sulfate (HS) on the surface of the olfactory neuroepithelium in mice and infects the neuronal cilia, leading to infection of either neurons or glial cells. They also found that HS is only found on the apical neuronal cilia, not on the basolateral surface, which is where most epithelial cells display it. Therefore, the authors suggest that MuHV-4 binds to the apical surface of the olfactory neuroepithelium and uses the neuronal cilia to enter the underlying glial cells. This finding provides important information on how viruses enter new hosts, and can help us better understand how viruses spread and infect people.
Salmonella is a common gastrointestinal pathogen. It is able to invade and survive inside epithelial and phagocytic cells, respectively, by inducing virulence programs under specific conditions. In this study, researchers have discovered a new regulatory circuit that controls the expression of SPI-1 genes by CRP-cAMP. They have found that CRP-cAMP represses the expression of SPI-1 genes in the middle of the logarithmic growth phase. Genetic analyses revealed that CRP-cAMP modulates the level of HilD, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion. This regulation occurs at the post-transcriptional level and requires the presence of a newly identified regulatory motif within the hilD 3’UTR. The researchers also demonstrated that Spot 42, a small RNA, targets the 3’UTR of the hilD transcript to regulate its expression. Their findings suggest that the hilD 3’UTR acts as a hub for post-transcriptional control of Salmonella invasion gene expression.
Scientists are trying to understand why certain diseases, like Huntington's disease, affect specific tissues, even within the same person. They discovered that the expansion of a type of DNA structure called trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) causes these diseases, but the TNRs become unstable and expand even more in certain tissues. They studied mice that have TNRs in their DNA to see if transcription, the process of making a copy of DNA, could cause this instability. They found that the mice had more TNR expansion in a tissue that was affected by the disease and that transcription was happening in this tissue. This suggests that transcription is involved in the instability of TNRs and may be a reason why certain tissues are affected by these diseases.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the most dangerous enteroviruses, and we don't know why. In this study, researchers analyzed the genetic features of EV71 in an immunocompromised patient who had the virus in different parts of their body. They compared the genomes of the virus from the patient's respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous system, and blood specimens. They found three mutations that occurred within five days: one in VP1, one in 2B, and one in 3D. They made infectious clones with these mutations and found that the mutation in VP1 helped the virus replicate better in a particular type of brain cell. They also found that this mutation was often associated with a second mutation in a different part of VP1 in those brain cells. They made a 3D model of the virus with the mutations and found that the mutations did not change the structure of the virus, but they might change how the virus interacts with brain cells. In summary, this study found that a specific mutation in VP1 of EV71 helps the virus replicate better in certain brain cells and might contribute to the virus spreading to the brain.
In the study, the authors present a detailed analysis of the ComRS pathway, which is a key regulator of natural transformation (competence) in the genus Streptococcus. The ComRS pathway is activated by the binding of XIP, a secreted peptide, to a receptor called ComR. The authors first used a test-bed assay to measure the activity of different ComR proteins in response to cognate and heterologous XIP peptides in vivo. They found that ComR proteins from different species have distinct levels of specificity for XIP. They then solved an X-ray crystal structure of ComR from S. suis to further understand the interaction with XIP and search for structural features that may explain XIP recognition. Using the structure as a guide, they probed the apo conformation of the XIP-binding pocket by site-directed mutagenesis, both in test-bed cultures and biochemically in vitro. They found that the pocket is lined by a variable and a conserved face, where residues of the conserved face contribute to ligand binding and the variable face discriminate among XIP peptides. Together, their results not only provide a model for XIP recognition and specificity, but also allow for the prediction of novel XIP peptides that induce ComR activity.
The authors used the yeast Candida albicans as a model to study the properties of centromeric DNA during replication. They discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome. Furthermore, they showed that the replication of centromeric DNA is correlated with the replication timing of the entire chromosome, and that the timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position.
Back pain is the #1 cause of disability worldwide, but not much is known about its biology. In this study, researchers used a special technique called genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find genetic markers associated with chronic back pain (CBP). They combined data from 16 different studies to increase the number of people and genetic markers studied. They found a genetic marker associated with CBP in SOX5. This genetic marker was also found in a replication study of another large dataset. They also found two other genetic markers that showed genome-wide significance in a joint meta-analysis.
This study aims to estimate the cost and Disability Adjusted Life Year ( DALY ) burden of Taenia solium cysticercosis in the West of Cameroon, which is an important but neglected zoonotic disease of man and pigs. The study estimates that 50,326 people have neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy, which is 1% of the local population, and 15,961 pigs have been diagnosed with cysticercosis, which is 5.6% of the local pig population. The total estimated annual costs due to T. solium cysticercosis in the West of Cameroon are €10,255,202, of which 4.7% are due to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% to direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis. The monetary burden per case of cysticercosis is €194, and the average number of DALYs lost is 9.0 per thousand persons per year. The study shows that the estimated cost and number of DALYs lost probably underestimate the real values because the estimations have been based on epilepsy as the only symptom of cysticercosis. The estimated number of DALYs lost due to the disease is higher than estimates already available for some other neglected tropical diseases. This study provides important information on the burden of T. solium cysticercosis and can help in developing more effective strategies for the control of this disease.
The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus produces a lot of RNA molecules that are not translated into proteins. Researchers have found that some of these RNAs have a C-rich sequence that suggests they regulate other RNAs. One of these RNAs, called RsaA, controls the production of MgrA, a protein that regulates the growth and development of the bacteria. By forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and a loop-loop interaction within the coding region of the target mRNA, RsaA represses the translation of mgrA mRNA. This leads to changes in the way the bacteria form biofilm and synthesize their capsule, which makes them more vulnerable to being killed by immune cells. Experiments with mice showed that RsaA attenuates the severity of acute systemic infections and enhances chronic catheter infection. Overall, RsaA plays an important role in the way S. aureus interacts with the host immune system.
The process of uncoating, or disassembling, the HIV-1 capsid is an important step in the infection of target cells. This step is poorly understood, but it is critical for the successful establishment of a life-long infection. In this study, the authors use a novel strategy to visualize the uncoating process using a fluorescently tagged form of a protein called cyclophilin A (CypA-DsRed). By imaging individual virions, the authors show that CypA-DsRed remains associated with the core of the virus after permeabilization/removal of the viral membrane. They also show that CypA-DsRed and the capsid protein (CA) are lost concomitantly from the cores in vitro and in living cells. The authors also show that the majority of single cores lose CypA-DsRed shortly after viral fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. These findings provide new insights into the poorly understood process of uncoating and may help in the development of new antiviral drugs.
This paper is about the complexity and organization of prokaryotic DNA. The authors analyze the information content of oligonucleotides, which are short chains of nucleotides, and investigate how this information varies depending on the size of the oligonucleotide. They find that there is a lot of information carried by oligonucleotides up to 6 nucleotides long, but little additional information beyond that. They also analyze the DNA composition of different parts of the genome, and find that there is more AT content in non-coding regions compared to coding regions, which may be related to DNA curvature. Finally, the authors compare the DNA composition of different groups of prokaryotes, and find that GC-rich prokaryotes have a less random DNA composition than AT-rich prokaryotes.
Researchers have studied recombination in human hotspots, which are areas where recombination occurs more frequently than in other parts of the genome. They have found that certain factors, such as the protein "PRDM9" and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), can influence the initiation of recombination at these hotspots. However, little is known about how other factors act downstream of recombination initiation. To address this, the researchers analyzed both CO and NCO recombinant molecules in sperm DNA at six highly active hotspots. They looked for disparity in the transmission of allelic variants, which could be indicative of cis-acting influences. At two of the hotspots, they identified a novel type of biased gene conversion acting solely on the NCO class of recombinant. This bias favors strong (GC) over weak (AT) base pairs, and is not predicted to lead to hotspot attenuation but represents a previously unappreciated yet significant source of meiotic drive operating in the human genome.
The paper describes a computational method to associate chemicals and diseases, or chemicals and specific proteins. This method uses a combination of different data sources, such as gene expression data from toxicogenomics studies, chemical structures, and protein-protein interaction data. The paper also provides examples of unexpected chemical-protein associations and disease associations that were found using this method. These associations are supported by references to scientific literature. The paper highlights the importance of this method in understanding the effects of chemicals on human health and in identifying potential targets for drug development.
This study aimed to develop a model that could accurately predict the responses of neurons in the primary auditory cortex of ferrets to natural sounds. The study built on previous research that used the receptive field (RF) model to describe how the best-fitting linear transformation of a stimulus is translated into a neural response. However, the study found that this model was limited in its ability to capture the complexity of cortical processing, particularly in response to natural stimuli. The researchers developed a new model called the network receptive field (NRF) model, which is composed of a hierarchical feedforward network of up to 7 non-linear units. The NRF model can better predict neural responses to auditory stimuli than the RF model, and it reveals distinct non-linear properties such as gain control and conjunctive feature selectivity. Conjunctive feature selectivity refers to the ability of a neuron to respond when certain features are present together, but not in isolation. The study found that conjunctive feature selectivity is important in allowing neurons to show increased selectivity to specific complex spectrotemporal structures, which may be critical for sound recognition. The NRF model is easily interpretable in a physiological context and provides a valuable approach for understanding the neural computations underlying perception.
The mammalian circadian system is a biological clock that regulates our daily sleep-wake cycle, metabolism, and other activities. This clock is made up of transcription factors called clock proteins, including BMAL1 and CRY1/2. These proteins operate in feedback loops to drive rhythmic expression of genes, or "clock genes", that control the daily rhythm of our biological activities. However, the exact mechanism by which these clock proteins regulate the clock is not well understood. In this study, the authors discovered that CRY1/2 represses the activity of a protein kinase called CK2, which phosphorylates BMAL1. This phosphorylation is important for the proper functioning of the clock. The authors propose a model for how CRY1/2 and CK2 work together to regulate the clock. They suggest that CRY1/2 represses CK2 activity, which in turn regulates the phosphorylation of BMAL1. This negative feedback loop is an integral part of the clock's feedback mechanism, which helps to keep the clock running smoothly.
This article describes how bacteria called Salmonella enterica adapt to survive in the harsh environment of bile, a fluid found in the liver and small intestine that has antibacterial properties. The article explains that Salmonella can adapt to survive higher concentrations of bile by changing the way they express certain genes, and that this adaptation can be achieved by growing them in the presence of sublethal concentrations of bile before they are exposed to lethal concentrations. The article also mentions that not all Salmonella cells need to adapt to survive in bile, as some cells can become bile-resistant without any prior adaptation. These bile-resistant cells may be rare and may exist because of random mutations or activation of certain genes. The article highlights the importance of studying how bacteria adapt to their environment and the potential relevance of these adaptation mechanisms for understanding how Salmonella colonizes and infects the liver and small intestine.
The E. coli genome is compacted into domains, which are separated by barriers to prevent the mixing of different domains. The domains are maintained by a combination of gyrase, the MuB protein, IHF, Fis, HU, and DNA-protein interactions. The prophage Mu forms a stable domain that is maintained by the strong gyrase site (SGS) at the center of Mu, the MuL end, and the MuB protein. The Mu domain is observed at two different locations on the genome. By contrast, the prophage λ does not form a stable domain. The formation of the Mu domain is promoted by low-level transcription from two Mu promoters. It is believed that the domain promotes the topological requirements for transposition and brings the Mu ends into close proximity. The domain may also benefit the host by helping to maintain the prophage in the long-term.
The study aimed to understand the dynamics of Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) gametocyte infections in children in Papua New Guinea (PNG) after being treated with blood-stage antimalarials with or without primaquine (PQ). The study found that PQ treatment significantly reduced the risk of recurrent Pv blood-stage infection, Pv episode, and Pv gametocyte carriage by 82%, 75%, and 73%, respectively. Additionally, the study found that Pv gametocyte density was higher in episodes caused by relapses than those caused by new infections. The study also found that PQ treatment had a long-term effect on Pf gametocytaemia, but not on Pv gametocytaemia. Overall, the study highlights the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment in controlling Pv transmission.
In this study, the authors developed a mathematical model to analyze the cycling of the Rho family of GTPases between membrane and cytosol. Their hypothesis is that the details of GTPase cycling are key to the differential upstream regulation of these biochemical switches. The authors developed a modeling framework to analyze experimental data for these systems. This analysis can reveal details of GTPase cycling and help distinguish between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and direct association-dissociation of GTPase with membrane molecules. The authors used this methodology to analyze glucose stimulated Rac cycling in pancreatic β-cells. Their charts are used to illustrate the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities between GTPases and membrane and/or GDI on the amount of membrane bound GTPase. The authors suggest that their analysis could be used as a guide in assessing how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios.
Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by worms that live in the intestines or urinary tract. The World Health Organization (WHO) wants to eliminate this disease as a public health problem by treating people with a medicine called praziquantel. In order to determine how much of the population needs to be treated, it is important to know how many people are infected. The infection is usually found in children aged 5-14, but adults can also be infected. Treatment is usually given to children, but treating only children may not be enough to eliminate the disease. To determine the best treatment strategy, researchers are using a mathematical model to study how different age profiles of infection in adults can impact the recommendations of the WHO. They found that for moderate prevalence regions, treating only children may be enough to eliminate the disease. However, for high prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adults need to be treated as well. Therefore, the researchers recommend collecting infection data from a broader age range, including adults, to accurately determine the best treatment strategy for a region. They also recommend collecting other data, such as individual adherence to treatment, to determine the progress of the treatment strategy.
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a neurological disorder that causes seizures. Surgery is sometimes performed to remove the parts of the brain that are thought to be causing the seizures. However, this procedure is not always successful. In this study, researchers used a computer model to predict how surgery would affect seizures in patients with TLE. They used data from MRI scans to create a model of each patient's brain, which allowed them to predict where seizures would start and where they would spread. The researchers found that patients with TLE were more likely to have seizures than healthy controls, and that certain parts of the brain were more likely to start seizures. They also found that surgery that removed these parts of the brain could lead to fewer seizures.
This article is about how a protein called vIRF-1 from a virus called Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) blocks the ability of cells to die in a process called apoptosis. HHV-8 uses several strategies to do this, one of which is by inactivating a protein called Bim. Bim is a protein that helps to promote apoptosis, so by blocking it, HHV-8 can help itself to replicate. The authors of this article discovered that vIRF-1 directly interacts with Bim and that this interaction helps to keep Bim out of the nucleus of the cell, where it can't do its job. They also found that blocking this interaction can make Bim more effective at killing the cell. This suggests that targeting this interaction could be a good way to stop HHV-8 from replicating.
The lung is a delicate organ that plays a crucial role in protecting the body by fighting off harmful pathogens that are inhaled in our daily lives. This fighting action is accomplished by a complex group of immune cells that work together to balance rapid and efficient microbial clearance with protection of the lung. When the balance between immune surveillance and lung protection is upset, the result is lung damage caused by pathogens. This damage can lead to acute lung injury, which in severe cases can be fatal. A recent study has shown that an epithelial protein called αVβ6 integrin is crucial for the body to maintain the delicate balance between immune surveillance and lung protection. The study found that mice lacking this protein were protected from influenza virus-induced disease and had a lower mortality rate. Mechanistically, the study found that αVβ6 integrin controls the homeostatic lung interferon response. When this protein is missing, the interferon response is constitutively active, giving the host an advantage over the spread of the virus. This protective phenotype was reversed by exogenous TGF-β1 or elimination of the type I interferon receptor, suggesting that αVβ6 integrin controls a communication system between lung epithelia and immune cells through a TGF-β-dependent mechanism. These findings have important implications for the management of acute lung injury and suggest that transient inhibition of αVβ6 may be a potential therapy.
Leishmaniasis is a group of diseases caused by a parasite that can infect the skin or other organs. It affects over 398 million people worldwide, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. Leishmania ( Viannia ) braziliensis is the most common type of leishmaniasis in the Americas, causing ATL, which affects the skin and/or mucous membranes. This study analyzed data from 733 patients with suspected ATL who were evaluated at a reference center in Argentina from 2006-2015. The researchers found that LST, a support tool for diagnosis, can be used effectively in the diagnosis of ATL even in endemic areas. LST is a test that measures the immune response to Leishmania antigens injected intradermally and is based on delayed-type hypersensitivity responses. It can help doctors diagnose leishmaniasis and is a useful tool in the management of suspicious cases. This study provides evidence for the usefulness of LST in the diagnosis of ATL and highlights the need for further research on this topic.
The article describes how scientists used a new technique to study changes in how genes are regulated when human macrophages are exposed to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). OxLDL is a type of cholesterol that has been linked to the development of heart disease. The scientists found that oxLDL changes the way certain genes are controlled and that these changes are linked to an increased risk of heart disease. They also found that a specific genetic variation, which has been linked to heart disease in the past, affects the way one of these genes is controlled and this may contribute to the increased risk of heart disease associated with that genetic variation. This study provides new insights into how certain genetic variations increase the risk of heart disease.
Malawi is a country in Africa that has a high number of people with a disease called trachoma. Trachoma is an eye disease caused by a bacterium that can cause blindness. To reduce the number of people with trachoma, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a plan called the SAFE strategy, which includes four components: antibiotics, facial cleanliness, environmental improvement, and surgery. The WHO recommends that in some places where trachoma is prevalent, the antibiotics should be given to everyone in the area. This is known as mass drug administration (MDA). The WHO also recommends that in some places where the prevalence of trachoma is high, it should be measured in smaller areas called sub-districts. However, measuring the prevalence of trachoma in smaller areas can be difficult and costly. In this study, the WHO and the Malawi government decided to give antibiotics to everyone in eight Malawi districts with a high prevalence of trachoma. They then measured the prevalence of trachoma in these districts after the treatment. The results of the study show that in all eight districts, the prevalence of trachoma in children aged 1-9 was reduced to less than 5%. This means that the SAFE strategy can help reduce the prevalence of trachoma in large areas with high prevalence of trachoma.
The immune system of plants, like humans, uses special proteins called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect invading pathogens. When a pathogen is detected, the plant immune response is triggered, which includes cell death, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and changes in gene expression to limit the spread of the pathogen. Some plant NLR proteins, which are important for the immune response, are activated by pathogen effectors, which are molecules produced by the pathogen to interfere with the host immune system. These activated NLR proteins trigger complex signaling mechanisms, which involve multiple proteins and subcellular compartments. To better understand these mechanisms, researchers have studied Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant for plant immunity research. In particular, they have focused on six closely related Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) that are involved in the immune response triggered by NLR proteins RPS2 and RPM1. They have used biochemical and genetic screens to identify the specific functions of these six CPKs. They found that each CPK has a distinct substrate specificity and subcellular dynamics, and that different CPKs are involved in different aspects of the immune response, such as cell death, ROS production and transcriptional reprogramming. They also found that a specific subgroup of WRKY transcription factors work synergistically with CPKs to regulate transcriptional reprogramming crucial for NLR-dependent restriction of pathogen growth. Their findings provide new insights into the bifurcation of complex signaling mechanisms downstream of NLR immune sensors mediated by the myriad action of CPKs with distinct substrate specificity and subcellular dynamics.
This study is about a forecasting method for a disease called schistosomiasis, which affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Schistosomiasis is caused by parasites that infect people who come into contact with contaminated water. The study used a forecasting method that works well with time-series data, which is data collected over time. The study looked at a time-series for the district of Niono, Mali, which showed the consultation rate for schistosomiasis. The study then used a forecasting method to predict the consultation rate for the next several months. The method worked well and accurately predicted the consultation rate. This information could be used to help manage and assess the impact of interventions to reduce schistosomiasis transmission in the district of Niono, Mali.
Herpesviruses like HCMV have genes that help them target the cell cycle machinery to stop or slow down the cell cycle at a stage that's good for virus replication. One such gene is pUL21a, which binds to cyclin A and causes it to be destroyed, keeping the cell in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. HCMV also has a different gene called pp150 that binds to cyclin A and blocks viral gene expression in cells that are already in the G2 phase. When pp150 is removed, HCMV can infect cells in the G2 phase and this causes a G2/M arrest. To get past this, HCMV needs a protein called pUL21a, which helps to remove pp150 from the cell cycle and let HCMV replicate. Without both pp150 and pUL21a, HCMV cannot replicate. This shows that pp150 and pUL21a work together to help HCMV replicate.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to the progressive degeneration of motor neurons and eventual death. Genetic studies of familial ALS have identified a number of causative mutations, but the genetic causes of the majority of sporadic ALS cases remain unknown. In this study, researchers sequenced the genes associated with ALS in 242 sporadic ALS cases and 129 controls to identify new genetic variants. They found an enrichment of rare and novel variants in cases compared to controls, indicating that they are likely identifying disease-associated mutations. The study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing combined with functional studies and rare variant analysis tools to provide insight into the genetic etiology of ALS.
A recent study by researchers found that a cytokine called IL-6 plays a critical role in the development of long-term memory CD4+ T cells in response to influenza virus. IL-6 is produced by various types of cells, including lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. While IL-6 has been shown to increase the severity of influenza virus infection in humans, studies in mice have shown that IL-6 does not contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of influenza virus. However, IL-6 plays a pivotal role in regulating the immune system. The cytokine affects the transition from the innate immune response to the acquired immune response, which involves different leukocyte subsets. IL-6 also controls T-cell proliferation, survival, and effector function, and has a crucial role in directing antigen-specific T-cell responses. In this study, the researchers compared influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell memory after infection of WT and IL-6−/− C57BL/6 mice with influenza virus. The results of this study showed that IL-6 selectively regulates long-term CD4+ T cell memory responses by limiting the activity of virus-specific Tregs. This study highlights the critical role of IL-6 in the development of T cell memory responses to influenza virus.
The current study describes the interaction between the enzyme enolase and the protein Dnmt2 in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Enolase was discovered to have a dual function in the parasite; it catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate in the glycolytic pathway, and it also acts as an inhibitor of Dnmt2. The inhibitory activity of enolase on Dnmt2 was antagonized by 2-phosphoglycerate. Additionally, enolase was found to have a nuclear localization in the parasite, where it formed additional complexes with the Dnmt2 homologue Ehmeth. Finally, it was demonstrated that enolase can inhibit the methylation of tRNAAsp in the parasite.
Mosquitoes are important vectors for transmitting many diseases to humans. During the feeding process, mosquitoes inject saliva into the skin, which contains many factors that help them to feed and also modulate the immune response of the host. In this study, the authors discovered that mosquito saliva also contains a variety of small molecules called microRNAs, which are involved in regulating gene expression. They found that different types of mosquitoes, including Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which are known to transmit diseases to humans, have different miRNA profiles in their saliva. They also discovered that the saliva of CHIKV-infected mosquitoes has different miRNA profiles compared to uninfected mosquitoes, indicating that the miRNAs may play a role in the transmission and establishment of the virus in the host. The authors suggest that further research is needed to fully understand the role of miRNAs in mosquito-borne disease transmission and to develop new strategies for controlling these diseases.
Mitochondria are organelles that produce energy for our cells. They have their own genome, which is important for their function. However, the proteins that help repair the mitochondrial genome are not well understood. Researchers have found that proteins that help repair DNA in the nucleus also help repair DNA in the mitochondria. They also found that these proteins help repair DNA that has repeated sequences. These proteins are important for the survival of cells and organisms.
Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a serious condition that causes heart damage and can lead to heart failure and death. It is more common in disadvantaged populations and is caused by a bacterium called Group A Streptococcus (GAS). This bacterium can cause a fever called acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and can lead to RHD. Crowding, poor housing, low education, unemployment, low income, and poor nutrition are all factors that have been linked to the risk of ARF and RHD. However, more research is needed to understand how these factors contribute to the development of ARF and RHD, and what interventions could be used to prevent them.
This study looks at how a single point mutation in a protein can cause a dramatic change in the properties of a network. The study focuses on the E. coli PhoQ/PhoP system, which is a common signaling system in bacteria. The system detects different environmental conditions and controls the transcription of a large set of genes. The system consists of two proteins, PhoQ and PhoP, which work together to control gene transcription. PhoQ detects the environmental conditions and transfers a phosphoryl group to PhoP, which then functions as a transcription factor. However, PhoQ also acts as a phosphatase, which dephosphorylates PhoP. This bifunctional design allows for the system to be buffered against changes in protein concentrations and reduces cross-talk. The system is also autoregulated, meaning that the transcription of the phoPphoQ operon is activated by PhoP-P. This autoregulation improves the dynamic range of the network output at high stimulus and gives rise to a surge in transcription upon activation. The wild-type PhoQ/PhoP system responds to external stimulus in a graded rather than an all-or-none manner and the response of a population of cells is unimodal. However, when a point mutation is introduced that abolishes the phosphatase activity of PhoQ, the system becomes bistable. This means that the mutant persists in morphologically distinct OFF and ON states for many generations. The architectural features of the network that allow the mutant to exhibit bistability are shared among many two-component systems. However, the bistable phenotype of the mutant comes at a fitness cost. The study shows that a population of cells can be epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state. This study highlights the tradeoffs in the particular case of the PhoQ/PhoP system and demonstrates the remarkable versatility of the prototypical two-component signaling architecture.
Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeba that can infect humans. These infections can be deadly and are difficult to treat, making PAM a particularly devastating infection. However, due to a lack of economic inducements, anti-PAM drug discovery largely relies on drug repurposing, which involves using known drugs for new purposes. A recent study found that the amoeba N . fowleri shares similarities with fungi in terms of its essential requirement for ergosterol, which is a building block of cell membranes. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors has been shown to be an effective interventional strategy against fungal pathogens. The study also found that the N . fowleri genome encodes the sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51) target, which shares ~35% sequence identity with human, fungal, and kinetoplastid orthologues. This raises the possibility of repurposing anti-mycotic drugs and optimizing their usage for the treatment of PAM. In order to validate the “druggable” target in N . fowleri, the study chemically validated the sterol biosynthesis pathway and determined the endogenous NfCYP51 substrate. The study also characterized drug-target interactions by UV-vis spectroscopy and protein x-ray crystallography. Overall, the study suggests that anti-mycotic drugs may be effective in the treatment of PAM, and further investigation into this possibility is warranted.
There is currently no vaccine against parasitic worms and our understanding of how our body's immune system fights these worms is still developing. One way our body fights these worms is by producing a type of antibody called IgG1. These antibodies are produced with the help of a protein called IL-4Rα. We found that IL-4Rα helps to maintain the body's type 2 immune responses after a primary infection with a worm called Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Without IL-4Rα, the body's ability to fight the worm is reduced. We also found that IL-4Rα helps the body to recall type 2 immune responses and expel the worm more efficiently after a secondary infection. This means that IL-4Rα is not only important for fighting the worm during the primary infection but also for fighting it again if the person gets infected again. Our findings suggest that IL-4Rα is an important part of the immune system's response to parasitic worm infections.
Human movements and actions have impacts for wildlife diseases [1, 2]. These impacts are of concern both from a wildlife conservation standpoint [1, 2] and from a public health perspective (spillover) [3]. Over 60% of emerging infectious diseases in the world are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted from animals to humans [3]. Despite the fact that zoonosis is an important component of emerging infectious diseases, it is often difficult to trace the ecology and evolution of zoonotic pathogens [4]. Most efforts to identify the source of zoonoses occur after a human has become infected [4]. However, Bartonella bacteria are an exception to this pattern because they are usually found at high prevalence in many animals and can cause cat scratch fever, Carrion’s disease, and trench fever in humans [5, 6]. In this study, we construct the largest global phylogenies of Bartonella from 16s rRNA genes and citrate synthase (gltA) to determine the evolutionary history of Bartonella, patterns of host switching, and its spillover into humans or from human commensals into wild species. The citrate synthase gene is known to give high power to discriminate between Bartonella strains and is one of the most commonly sequenced Bartonella genes [7, 8]. We also examine 16s as it is the most commonly sequenced locus for metagenomics studies, though it gives low power to discriminate between Bartonella species [8].
The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 is involved in cancer cell proliferation, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In this study, researchers found that MALAT1 levels change during the cell cycle and that its activity is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. MALAT1 is involved in regulating the expression and pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle genes.
Juvenile hormone (JH) is a chemical that controls insect growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction. JH helps to make female insects produce eggs. In locusts, JH helps to make eggs by making the fat body cells make a lot of a protein called vitellogenin. To understand how this happens, scientists used special chemicals called RNAi to stop the JH receptor gene from working. They found that a gene called Mcm4 helps JH to make the fat body cells make a lot of vitellogenin. Scientists also found that a gene called Mcm7 helps JH to make the fat body cells make a lot of vitellogenin. They also found that JH receptor protein binds to a specific part of DNA in the Mcm4 and Mcm7 genes to make them make more of their proteins.
Leprosy is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared leprosy eliminated as a public health problem in 2000. However, in 2015, over 210,000 new cases of leprosy were diagnosed worldwide. Leprosy often causes sensory and motor nerve function impairment (NFI), which can lead to disabilities and deformities. To prevent these complications, it is important to treat NFI early. Prednisolone, an immune suppressor, is commonly used to treat NFI. However, the optimal treatment duration has not been established. In this study, we evaluated whether a 32-week prednisolone course is more effective than a 20-week course in restoring and improving recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients. We found that a 20-week course of prednisolone was as effective as a 32-week course in improving and restoring NFI in leprosy patients. Therefore, we recommend a 20-week prednisolone course as the preferred initial treatment duration for leprosy neuropathy, after which only a minority of patients may require further individualized treatment.
Elk and red deer are two closely related species that produce very different types of calls during the mating season. Elk produce high-pitched bugles with a fundamental frequency of around 1000 Hz, while red deer produce low-frequency roars. The complexity of these vocalizations can be related to natural and sexual selection, as certain acoustic features can provide information about the sender's physical characteristics. In this study, we used a finite element model of the larynx and a wave propagation model of the vocal tract to simulate elk and red deer calls. We found that the bugle requires both large muscular effort and high lung pressure, while the roar requires low vocal fold strain. The bugle allows for higher glottal efficiency, which provides an advantage in high-pitched signaling. The two call types relate differently to the physical qualities of the sender. The roar relates to overall body size, while the bugle may signal muscular strength and endurance. Our findings provide insight into the physiological tradeoffs related to the production of high and low frequency sounds in mammals.
Next generation sequencing has become a powerful way to answer genome-wide questions. One popular approach is chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) that identifies transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications. A major challenge in ChIP-seq analysis is to map the sequenced reads to a reference genome and retain the reads that map to unique locations (uni-reads). Although this reduces the coverage and sequencing depth, it is usually not a problem because most uni-reads are adjacent to discarded multi-reads. However, this poses a challenge for identifying binding locations in repetitive regions of the genome because there are few uni-reads in these regions. Multi-reads, which map to multiple locations on the reference genome, can be useful for identifying binding locations in repetitive regions. Therefore, we developed a method for utilizing multi-reads and showed that it can improve the detection of binding locations, especially in segmental duplications. We also experimentally validated some of the binding locations identified by multi-reads and found novel target genes of GATA1.
Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a group of diseases that are often found in low-income areas of the world. These diseases can have significant negative economic impacts on individuals and communities. There are several diseases in this category, including Chagas disease, human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, and visceral leishmaniasis. In order to reduce these negative impacts, there are targets in place to eliminate or control these diseases. The World Health Organization has set targets for 2020, which have been reinforced by the 2012 London Declaration. To understand the impact of these targets, researchers estimated the economic benefits of meeting them for each of these four diseases. They did this by looking at the productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments related to these diseases and comparing them to a counterfactual scenario, where the situation in 1990 stayed unchanged. The researchers estimated that meeting these targets would result in a total of $23.1 billion in productivity gains in the years 2011-2020 and $35.9 billion in the years 2021-2030. They also estimated that these targets would result in a reduction of $14 billion in out-of-pocket payments in the years 2011-2020 and $18 billion in the years 2021-2030. The researchers faced some limitations in their work, including a lack of data on out-of-pocket payments for leprosy. Despite these limitations, the researchers estimate that the benefits of meeting these targets are considerable and that they represent good value for money.
This study looked at how well a group of 171 neurons in a monkey's brain encoded information about sounds that they heard. Neurons that respond only to certain types of sound inputs are thought to provide more information about those sounds than neurons that respond to a wider range of sound inputs. In the study, the researchers looked at how the brain encoded the presence and content of sounds by examining two different types of response in the neurons. They found that the information encoded was almost entirely dependent on how many spikes the neurons produced in a certain time period. The researchers also found that a type of spiking pattern called Poisson spiking was sufficient to explain this property. This finding has important implications for how we understand how the brain processes information from the outside world and may be true for multiple sensory systems.
During acute viral infections, the immune system is able to clear the virus. However, during chronic viral infections, the immune system needs to maintain anti-viral T cells in order to control viral replication and prevent the virus from spreading. To do this, a special type of T cells called anti-viral T cells are needed. These anti-viral T cells express a special molecule called OX40 (CD134) that is important for the maintenance of anti-viral T cells. Without OX40, the immune system is not able to control chronic viral infections.
In this study, the authors analyzed how many different animals have independently evolved a specific way of swimming that generates the most force and is the most efficient. They found that at least eight different types of animals have evolved this way of swimming, even though their last common ancestor did not have this feature. The authors call this phenomenon "convergent evolution" because it is unlikely that these animals evolved this way of swimming independently by chance alone. They suggest that the "optimal specific wavelength" (OSW) is a possible reason why this feature has evolved so many times. The OSW is the ratio of the wavelength of an undulation to its mean amplitude, and the authors found that it is around 20 in many different animals that swim by undulating their elongated fins. They argue that this feature is "optimal" because it generates the most force and is the most efficient way of swimming. They suggest that this feature may have evolved because it is biomechanically optimal, and it may be more likely to evolve than other features that are not as efficient or effective. The authors hope that their findings will help us understand how life evolves and how different animals may all come to have the same features, even if their ancestors did not have them. They believe that understanding this process will help us learn more about the natural world and how it works.
The development of the cerebral cortex involves a precise control of cell proliferation and differentiation. At early stages, neural stem cells (NSCs) divide symmetrically to generate more NSCs. NSCs also divide asymmetrically to form neurons and another NSC. To ensure that both daughter cells receive a complete set of chromosomes, a protein complex called condensin is needed to properly assemble and segregate them during mitosis. Despite the importance of condensin in mitosis, it is unclear why two types of condensin complexes, condensin I and condensin II, exist. To investigate this question, researchers generated mice with a conditional knockout of each condensin complex in neural stem cells. They found that both condensin complexes are essential for NSC divisions and survival, and they play distinct roles in mitosis. Remarkably, NSCs that are depleted of condensin II have abnormally large clusters of heterochromatin regions in their nuclei, which are taken over by postmitotic neurons. These findings delineate the essential and distinct functions of condensin I and condensin II in NSC divisions during cortical development.
A new study has investigated how a parasitic worm called Schistosoma mansoni develops and reproduces in its host, using RNA sequencing to analyze gene expression in different developmental stages and sexes. The study found that the parasite's sex is determined by a female heterogametic system, and that sex is determined later in development after the parasite has infected its vertebrate host. The study also found that the parasite has distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes, and that these landscapes change as the parasite develops. The study used a combination of RNA sequencing and ChIP-Seq analysis to investigate the molecular basis of sex determination and sexual differentiation in the parasite, and to identify candidate determinants of these processes, sex-biased players of the interaction with the vertebrate host, and differentially methylated regions between male and female worms. These findings could provide new insights into the parasite's reproductive function and could lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis.
In this study, we have developed a new approach to quantify our certainty in annotations made by multiple experts in the field of biology and medicine. We propose two probabilistic models that can be used to analyze curation data, such as annotation of function of genes and proteins, description of genetic variation in genomes, and cataloguing human phenotypes. Our approach allows us to retain the complete dataset as a basis for training and testing machine learning methods. We have used our models to analyze a newly annotated corpus of roughly 10,000 sentences. Each sentence in this corpus was annotated by three experts. We randomly sampled a subset of 1,000 sentences to reannotate by five new experts to test the utility of our computational predictions. Our study aims to provide a holistic approach to quantify our certainty in individual annotations for a group of several annotators, which allows to retain the complete dataset as a basis for training and testing machine learning methods.
A recent study conducted in Chile suggests that convalescent human plasma may be effective as a possible treatment for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). However, access to convalescent plasma from survivors of this lethal disease is limited. To address this problem, the authors explored the concept of using DNA vaccine technology to produce antiviral biologics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies for use in humans. The study focused on the Andes virus (ANDV), the primary cause of HPS in South America. Geese produce IgY and IgYΔFc, which can be purified at high concentrations from egg yolks. These antibodies lack the properties of mammalian Fc that make antibodies produced in horses, sheep, and rabbits reactogenic in humans. The authors found that all geese vaccinated with an ANDV DNA vaccine developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination, and maintained high levels of neutralizing antibodies for over one year. A booster vaccination resulted in extraordinary high levels of neutralizing antibodies (PsVNA80 titers >100,000). The authors mapped the epitopes of ANDV recognized by IgY and IgYΔFc purified from egg yolks, and found that these antibodies were highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins. Finally, the authors found that the DNA vaccine/goose platform can be used to produce a candidate antiviral biological product capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure in the hamster model of lethal HPS.
The current study used a type of genetic analysis called whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to study the methylomes of two different types of mouse lung cancer. A methylome is a complete set of DNA methylation patterns in a genome. Methylation is a chemical modification of DNA that is important for regulating gene expression. The study compared the methylomes of mouse lung cancer that were caused by a mutation in the Dnmt3a gene to those that did not have the mutation. The results showed that Dnmt3a is important for maintaining the methylation patterns in cancer cells. The study also found that Dnmt3a mutations may contribute to the development of certain types of cancer in humans.
The neurons in the bird's brain that help them learn and control songs are organized in a specific way. The neurons fire in a particular pattern to make a song, and this pattern is organized in time and space. Researchers have studied the neurons that make songs, but they have not been able to study how the neurons are organized in space and time. In this study, researchers used a special technique to measure the activity of many neurons at once, and they found that the neurons are organized in a specific way. They also found that the neurons fire in a specific pattern and at a specific time. The research helps us understand how the neurons in the brain work together to help birds learn and control songs.
The study is a report of a screen done to identify genes that function in adulthood to regulate lifespan in C. elegans, a roundworm. The screen was done by selecting 2,700 clones that caused embryonic or larval stage arrest when fed to the animals, and then screening them to see if they caused an increase in lifespan when fed to adults. The researchers found that C. elegans lifespan can be extended when fed RNAi targeting the insulin receptor at any larval stage through adulthood. They also found that conditionally inactivating the gene for the insulin receptor in the L1 larval stage caused dauer arrest, but inactivating it in adults increased lifespan. The researchers screened the 2,700 clones using an enhanced RNAi strain, eri-1, which improves RNAi in all cells, including neurons. Many of the longevity genes identified are expressed in the nervous system. The study also found that essential genes, which are required for development and thus have not been well-represented in previous genome-wide RNAi screens, are more conserved in phylogeny than genes without obvious developmental phenotype. The researchers identified 64 genes that cause an increase in lifespan when inactivated by RNAi. They also found that these essential genes may prove useful in studying the regulation of lifespan in adults, although conditional alleles will be needed to do this. The study also found that the insulin-signaling pathway, CR, stress adaptation, metabolism, and reproduction are potent and evolutionarily conserved regulators of aging.
In this study, researchers used a genetic screen to find a gene that is important for the first step of salamander and fish appendage regeneration, which is creating a special kind of skin that tells the tissue underneath to grow. They found that a protein called laminin beta 1a is important for this process. This protein is produced by cells in the special skin and helps to create a layer of cells that are ready to receive signals to grow. The researchers also found that the expression of this protein is controlled by a growth factor called Fgf20a, which helps to tell cells to become the special kind of skin. This study provides important information about the first step of appendage regeneration and could help to develop new ways to repair injured tissue.
In this article, the authors compare several linear mixed model (LMM) approaches for adjusting for population substructure in genome-wide association studies. These LMM approaches can be used with samples of individuals who may have distant relatedness but their relationship is unknown or uncertain. The authors investigate the performance of different LMM implementations via application to a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families. They find that all the LMM implementations are successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate, with strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches. The authors also compare the LMM results to those obtained using traditional family-based association tests and other approaches. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that LMM approaches are appealing alternatives to principal component-based approaches for adjusting for population substructure in genome-wide association studies.
Chagas disease is a severe disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted through insect bites. Currently, the available drugs for treating Chagas disease have many problems, such as toxic effects, partial efficacy, and being targeted against the acute phase of the disease. As a result, there is no effective treatment for the chronic phase of Chagas disease. In this study, researchers developed a new method to screen compounds that can treat Chagas disease by testing the activity of a library of 2000 compounds against T. cruzi parasites. Three compounds, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, were identified with high activity against T. cruzi parasites and low toxicity on mammalian cells. Each of these compounds has a different mechanism of action on the intracellular replication of T. cruzi amastigotes. CX1 is particularly effective, showing strong trypanocidal activity, which is important for treating the chronic phase of Chagas disease. The three compounds were also effective against T. cruzi parasites from the Y strain and against related kinetoplastid species. Further tests showed that two other compounds, PCH6 and CX2, have even stronger activity against T. cruzi parasites. These new compounds could be used to develop treatments for Chagas disease and other related diseases.
The paper presents a new method for detecting lymphatic filariasis in mosquitoes that is more practical, cost-effective and easy-to-use. The method uses a portable, battery-powered PCR platform that is easy to carry in a backpack and a test strip-based DNA detection assay. This new method extracts DNA from mosquitoes using a rapid, NaOH-based methodology and then amplifies a 132-base pair region of the non-coding HhaI repetitive DNA sequence element using a miniaturized PCR technology. The parasite DNA-derived amplicons are then detected using a test strip-based methodology, allowing point-of-collection-based sample processing. The paper also provides background information on lymphatic filariasis, its causes, symptoms, and current methods of detection and monitoring, as well as the need for more practical and cost-effective methods for disease surveillance.
Elastomeric proteins are self-assembling proteins that provide elasticity and resilience to tissues. The design and function of these proteins is influenced by their domain architecture. The study uses a modified diffusion-limited aggregation algorithm to simulate the self-assembly of elastomeric proteins. By varying the domain architecture, the study examines the impact of different configurations of elastomeric and cross-linking elements on the morphology and stability of the assembled polymer. Results provide insights into the molecular basis for the evolution of elastomeric proteins and help guide the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides.
Ebolaviruses are dangerous viruses that are spread to humans from animals and can cause a deadly disease. They have a long genome compared to other viruses, which is made up of seven different parts that make different proteins. One of these parts is the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR), which is important for the process of making proteins from the virus's genetic information. The researchers used experiments to learn more about how the 5′-UTRs of the seven different parts of the Ebolavirus genome affect the process of making proteins. They found that four of the seven 5′-UTRs have a section of genetic information that can start translation of another protein, but this is not efficient enough to start translation instead of the main protein. They also found that the 5′-UTR of the protein that makes the polymerase of the virus (L protein) can start translation of another protein that is not the main one, but this is not efficient enough to start translation instead of the main protein. However, in certain conditions, the 5′-UTR of the L protein can maintain translation of the main protein. This is important because the L protein is needed to make new copies of the virus. The researchers also found that changing a few nucleotides in the 5′-UTR of the L protein gene can reduce the amount of virus made by 10 to 100 times. This is important because it shows how small changes in the genetic information of the virus can have a big effect on how it makes copies of itself.
We have developed a method for precisely mapping DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human chromosomes. Our data suggest that DSBs occur at protected regions of the genome and that PARP1 and HNRNPa2B1 specifically bind to certain parts of these regions. This indicates that there may be a novel type of gene regulation that involves transcription or silencing of gene clusters located inside protected regions that are prone to DSBs. We also found that about 30% of the protected regions contain coordinately expressed genes. Our technique can be used to study fragile sites in human chromosomes and can be applied to many different types of human cells.
Researchers in Brazil studied trypanosomatids in bats captured in two areas of the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro. They found that the diversity of trypanosomatids was similar between the two areas, with a variety of species, including Trypanosoma dionisii, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Crithidia mellificae. This study contributes to our understanding of the distribution and diversity of trypanosomatids in bats in the Atlantic Forest and highlights the importance of preserving this forest for the health of humans and animals.
Ticks are important vectors of diseases for both humans and animals. In Europe, the Ixodes ricinus tick species is known to transmit a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites to both humans and animals. In this study, researchers analyzed the prevalence of 38 pathogens and four symbionts in 267 female Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in the French Ardennes. They found that 45% of the infected ticks were co-infected with up to five different pathogens. When adding symbiont prevalences, all ticks were infected by at least one microorganism, and up to eight microorganisms were identified in the same tick. The researchers also demonstrated high pathogen co-infection rates in ticks, raising questions about possible co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals. They found that pathogens and symbionts were able to interact with each other, with a strong association between Borrelia garinii and B . afzelii. The study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between tick-borne pathogens and symbionts, which could have important consequences to human and animal health.
Scientists have found that the genetic network that determines whether a stem cell becomes a red blood cell or a white blood cell has two possible states. One state is when neither type of blood cell is expressed. The other state is when one type of blood cell is expressed, and the other type is not. Scientists have developed a mathematical model that explains how this genetic network works, and what causes it to switch between these two states. They found that one key part of the network is a "cofactor" that helps one of the genes in the network switch off the other gene, causing it to go into the "primed" state. When this cofactor is suppressed, the network goes into the "committed" state, where one type of blood cell is expressed, and the other type is not. This model could help scientists understand how to control the process of hematopoiesis, or the process by which stem cells become blood cells.
The article focuses on identifying new genes that contribute to the resistance of Enterococcus faecalis to the antibiotic lysozyme, a key component of the human innate immune system. Researchers used random transposon mutagenesis in a strain of E. faecalis that was already resistant to lysozyme due to several previously identified genes. They then identified a new cluster of genes on the chromosome that were involved in the production of a surface polymer called the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (EPA). Further experiments showed that this polymer contributes to resistance to lysozyme and underpins virulence in a zebrafish model of infection, allowing E. faecalis to evade phagocytosis. Overall, this study sheds new light on the mechanisms of E. faecalis resistance to the innate immune system and its virulence.
In this study, the authors propose a novel two-stage regression framework called RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation) to integrate data from both The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) to identify key regulators that contribute to Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) pathogenesis. The study uses a case-control approach and a sample-specific regulatory activity inference model to identify prominent regulators and their relationships with gene expression in AML patients. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their model in predicting gene expression and in detecting known or confidence TF/miRNA-gene interactions. They also identify a potential prognostic marker using the inferred TF activities of C-Fos and propose a novel role of a recently identified miRNA hsa-miR-548p in AML pathogenesis. Overall, this study provides a valuable framework for integrating heterogeneous genomic data and identifying key regulators that contribute to complex diseases.
The paper explores the role of RNA silencing in Colletotrichum higginsianum, a fungal species that causes anthracnose disease in many plant species. The authors generated knock-out mutants for three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), two Dicer-like (DCL), and two Argonaute (AGO) proteins in C. higginsianum. No effects were observed on vegetative growth for any mutant strain when grown on complex or minimal media. However, severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology were observed in Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2 double mutant, and Δago1 strains. Total RNA transcripts and small RNA populations were analyzed in parental and mutant strains. A previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, ChNRV1, was derepressed in the Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2, and Δago1 strains. The conidiation and spore morphology defects were primarily caused by ChNRV1. Based on these results, RNA silencing involving ChDCL1 and ChAGO1 in C. higginsianum is proposed to function as an antiviral mechanism.
A new study is reporting the role of MOF, a histone acetyltransferase, in male meiosis. MOF is involved in the expansion of all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation from leptotene to pachytene stages, which are initiated by ATM and ATR, respectively. MOF regulates meiotic progression by facilitating the recruitment of MDC1 and the expansion of H2AX phosphorylation. Defects in MOF lead to loss of XY-H2AX phosphorylation expansion, MSCI failure, and reduction in crossover markers and chiasma formation.
We studied the effect of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) infection on early human T-cell development using a "Human Immune System" (HIS) mouse model. In this model, human immune cells were transplanted into mice with weakened immune systems, allowing them to grow and mature. We infected these mice with HTLV-1 at a time when different stages of human T-cell development were present in the thymus. We found that HTLV-1 infected these mice and altered the development of human T-cells, leading to the accumulation of mature single-positive CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen. We also observed increased expression of genes related to cell activation and survival, as well as the development of conditions that are commonly seen in patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, which is caused by HTLV-1 infection. These findings suggest that this HIS mouse model can be used to better understand the initial stages of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1 infection.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by worms that live in the blood vessels around the intestines or bladder of a human. People usually get infected by coming into contact with contaminated fresh water. The disease is common in Africa, and can cause various health problems such as anemia, pain, and organ damage. In Sudan, the disease is endemic, and a project was carried out from 2009 to 2011 to control it. This project involved treating people with the drug praziquantel, providing health education, and constructing a drinking water supply facility. The results showed that the prevalence of the disease was reduced by more than 50% after the project.
The NiV-M protein plays a critical role in matrix-mediated Nipah virus budding. The protein is found in the nucleus at early stages of infection before localizing to the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. The nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M and associated post-translational modification are essential for matrix-mediated virus budding. The protein is also involved in the regulation of viral assembly and budding via monoubiquitination, which influences both nuclear export and plasma membrane targeting. NiV-M budding is exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibitors.
In this study, researchers investigate the early events in the infection process of poliovirus (PV) by using live-cell imaging and a biochemical assay that measures RNA release. They found that the genome release by PV was a rapid and efficient process, taking place within 100-200 nm of the plasma membrane. The researchers discovered that PV RNA release did not limit the specific infectivity of the virus and was energy- and actin-dependent but did not require clathrin, caveolin, flotillin, or microtubules. Their findings provide new insights into the entry mechanism of nonenveloped viruses.
The paper describes the importance of dengue health education in Cambodia, and the strategies that have been used to educate communities about the disease. These strategies include outreach education by health centers, school education, and community education through feedback committees. The paper highlights the challenges faced by these strategies, including a lack of funding, a lack of training for health workers, and a lack of effective educational materials. The paper concludes by suggesting that more effective education strategies are needed to help prevent and control dengue fever in Cambodia.
This paper describes a study that looks at microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes, which are worms that cause chronic and disabling diseases in both humans and animals. The study aimed to investigate whether circulating miRNAs of nematode origin can be detected in host plasma or serum. The study used two different techniques to identify miRNAs in the plasma or serum of dogs infected with Dirofilaria immitis or humans infected with Onchocerca volvulus. These miRNAs were then compared to miRNAs detected in the plasma or serum of uninfected individuals. The study found that there were over 200 candidate nematode miRNAs in the plasma of infected dogs and 21 candidate nematode miRNAs in the serum of infected humans. The study also looked at whether parasite-derived circulating miRNAs could be used as a way to diagnose filarial infections. The results of the study showed that parasite-derived circulating miRNAs could be used to distinguish infected individuals from uninfected individuals. However, the study also found that the absolute copy numbers of these miRNAs were not significantly correlated with the number of microfilariae (mf) in the blood. This may be because the number of mf in the blood does not accurately reflect the total number of adult worms in the body. Despite this limitation, the study suggests that parasite-derived circulating miRNAs could be used as a way to diagnose filarial infections and could help predict the severity of the infection.
We study the allosteric activation of the kinase domain of Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, using a coarse-grained model. The model incorporates two individual experimental structures and allows switching between them. The results from the simulations reveal the existence of two parallel pathways for conformational activation, one of which is coupled with local unfolding of the N-lobe of the catalytic domain.
Postzygotic lethality is a process in which offspring of parents with different ploidies (chromosome number) die shortly after conception. This is caused by the mismatch of chromosome numbers between the parents, which leads to genetic incompatibilities. Recent research has identified a large-effect QTL called DSL1 and two other QTLs that affect postzygotic lethality in crosses between diploid and tetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana. These QTLs affect the rate of lethality in the offspring by controlling gene expression in the maternal sporophyte. A loss-of-function mutation in the TTG2 gene, which is located within the DSL1 QTL, suppresses the lethality caused by interploidy crosses. This research suggests that maternal gene expression may play a role in interploidy crosses and that postzygotic lethality may evolve rapidly.
In this study, the authors conduct a comparative analysis of host-pathogen coevolution in bats and rodents. They use Bartonella and Leptospira as case studies to examine the evolutionary patterns between these pathogens and their host species. The authors find that Bartonella and rodents exhibit strong overall patterns of cospeciation, indicating that the two lineages have coevolved over time. In contrast, Leptospira and bats do not exhibit strong evidence of coevolution, suggesting that the two lineages have undergone more frequent host switching. The authors argue that the frequency of host switching is likely due to differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology. The authors believe that understanding the coevolutionary patterns between reservoir host species and their associated pathogens is crucial for predicting spillover events and ultimately for developing predictive models for zoonotic disease emergence.
How do animals like undulatory swimmers move? This is a fundamental question in the field of biomechanics. The movement of undulatory swimmers is an emergent behavior that starts from muscle activation. There are two main issues in understanding undulatory swimming: the first is to understand how muscle activation leads to the observed deformation kinematics, and the second is to understand how deformation kinematics produce movement of the body as a whole. In this work, a forced damped oscillation framework is applied to a chain-link model for undulatory swimming to understand how forcing leads to deformation and movement. The study shows that a body has fundamental modes of deformation with corresponding natural frequencies. Forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the body, and an understanding emerges of how the deformation in turn generates forward translational motion of the body. The study quantitatively shows how the power generated from muscle work is used in creating body deformations and then dissipated into the surrounding fluid. A closed-form expression for swimming velocity is derived by a leading-order analysis of the equations of motion. Optimal deformation kinematics for fast swimming are obtained from the closed-form expression, leading to an understanding of optimal parameters controlling the optimal conditions for fast swimming. The study is verified by performing fully resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations.
Trypanosoma brucei is a parasite that causes the disease Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. This disease is transmitted by tsetse flies and affects humans and animals. The parasite has two subspecies that are morphologically indistinguishable, T. b. rhodesiense (Tbr) and T. b. brucei (Tbb). The subspecies Tbr is responsible for the zoonotic form of HAT in East Africa, while Tbb is the subspecies found in West Africa. The two subspecies are believed to freely exchange their SRA (Serum Resistance Associated) genes, which allows them to create new strains of the parasite with different properties. Genetic analysis of Tbr and Tbb has shown that the subspecies are very similar in their DNA, with the only major difference being the presence or absence of the SRA gene. Scientists have demonstrated that the SRA gene is responsible for the resistance of Tbr to human serum. The SRA gene can be easily transferred from Tbb to Tbr, which creates new strains of the parasite with the ability to infect humans. Scientists have also determined that the SRA gene is present on one homologue of chromosome IV in most Tbr isolates. This information is important because it helps researchers understand the genetic structure and diversity of the parasite, which can help them better understand the disease and develop new treatments.
The pancreas's islets of Langerhans are micro-organs that contain insulin-producing beta-cells. Dysfunction of these beta-cells can lead to diabetes. The author and their team previously discovered that a critical number of inexcitable cells can rapidly suppress the overall islet response, and this was a result of gap junction coupling between beta-cells. The team sought to understand how gap junction coupling exacerbates the effects of decreased cellular excitability in beta-cells. They discovered that reductions in gap junction coupling allowed progressively greater glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] and insulin secretion following expression of ATP-insensitive KATP channels. This was predicted for many mutations upon reductions in gap junction coupling, where stochastic noise played a significant role in the recoveries. These findings suggest novel therapeutic options for NDM and other monogenic forms of diabetes.
The article you are summarizing focuses on understanding the dynamic behavior of large networks made up of smaller modules. The authors show that the behavior of a module depends on how it is connected to other modules, which affects the dynamics of the whole network. They present a new analysis framework that takes this into account, using three matrices to quantify different types of retroactivity. They use this framework to analyze the dynamic behavior of different recurrent network motifs, and demonstrate how the framework can be used to predict the effects of interconnection on the modules. The authors show how their framework differs from other standard regulatory network models, and provide a new metric for measuring the robustness of a module's dynamic behavior to interconnection with other modules. They conclude that their framework provides valuable insights into the behavior of large regulatory networks.
The paper describes the construction of a fine-scale genetic map of the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the human X chromosome. The map includes directly observed crossovers and is based on pedigree data. The authors find that recombination is intense and rapid in this region, and that it is associated with a variety of evolutionary and biological phenomena. The paper also explores the role of the protein PRDM9 in recombination in the PAR, and provides new insights into the evolution of recombination in this region.
Scientists have discovered that a protein called JMJD2A can help myoblasts turn into myotubes. JMJD2A can remove a type of chemical mark (methyl group) from a specific type of histone (H3K9), which is important for muscle cell development. JMJD2A works in a way that it only removes the methyl group from some of the H3K9s. The scientists discovered that a version of JMJD2A that doesn't have the part of the protein that removes methyl groups (called ΔN-JMJD2A) can help myotube formation. They also found that ΔN-JMJD2A binds to the Myog gene and helps remove methyl groups from it, which allows the Myog gene to be turned on.
The paper reports on the cost-effectiveness of the Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) in the "end game" when the number of cases is lower and the cost per case is higher than at any other time. The study compares the GWEP with two alternative scenarios: doing nothing since 1986 and control (only surveillance and outbreak response during 2016-2030). The authors report the cost per case averted, cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted and cost per at-risk life year averted. They assess cost-effectiveness against a threshold of about one half GDP per capita (less than US$500 in low income countries). The study estimates that the GWEP cost an estimated US$11 (95% uncertainty interval, 4.70-12.49) per case averted in the period 1986-2030. The pre-certification and certification phases can cost as much as US$0.0041 and US$0.0015 per capita per year, respectively. The cost per DALY averted by the GWEP relative to doing nothing is estimated at US$222 (118-372) in 1986-2030. The GWEP is probably more cost-effective than control by the year 2030. The GWEP will still be cost-effective relative to doing nothing, even if economic costs are twice as high as the financial costs estimated for the period to 2020.
The protein BBK32 from the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi prevents the complement system from attacking the bacteria. The complement system is a group of proteins that recognize and kill invading microorganisms. The authors have investigated the function of BBK32 orthologues from other species of Lyme-associated spirochetes. They found that the BBK32 orthologue from B. afzelii has similar activities to BBK32 from B. burgdorferi, while the BBK32 orthologue from B. garinii has reduced activities. The authors solved the crystal structure of BBK32 from B. burgdorferi and found that it has a unique fold. They also made chimeric proteins and showed that the reduced activities of the B. garinii BBK32 orthologue were due to three specific residues. Finally, the authors demonstrated that the serine protease domain of C1r is required for BBK32 to bind to C1r. These results provide new insight into how Lyme-associated spirochetes evade the complement system.
A recent study has identified Fkh2, a transcription factor, as a target of both Cdc28 and Cbk1 kinases in a role distinct from its function in cell cycle regulation. The Fkh2 protein undergoes a diverse pool of phospho-isoforms during the morphological and transcriptional switch from commensalism to pathogenicity. The study identified residues phosphorylated by Cdc28 and Cbk1, and demonstrated that these phosphorylation events are required for hyphal-specific gene expression, which is necessary for pathogenesis. The study provides a novel regulatory circuit that activates hyphal-specific gene transcription necessary for pathogenesis, and highlights the importance of phosphorylation in C. albicans morphogenesis and pathogenesis.
The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei has both ways of making pyrimidine nucleotides. It can either make them from scratch or use salvaged pyrimidine nucleotides. Surprisingly, we found out that the parasite needs an enzyme called thymidine kinase (TK) to make pyrimidine nucleotides from scratch, even if they have salvaged nucleotides. We also found that the parasite needs an enzyme called cytidine deaminase (CDA) to use salvaged deoxycytidine to make deoxyuridine. Without these enzymes, the parasites cannot grow or survive. We discovered that the parasites have an unidentified enzyme that converts deoxyribonucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides, which build up in the absence of TK. We also found that the parasites have an HD-domain protein that converts deoxyribonucleotide 5'-monophosphates into their corresponding nucleosides. We concluded that TK is essential for the synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides regardless of whether they are made from scratch or salvaged. The absence of an enzyme called deoxycytidine deaminase in the parasites makes them vulnerable to drugs that target this enzyme in other organisms. Our findings suggest that a drug that targets TK in trypanosomes could be used to treat trypanosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people around the world.
The paper describes a study that aimed to understand how translation initiation occurs in prokaryotic mRNAs that do not have a specific sequence (Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence) that helps ribosomes recognize the start codon. The researchers found that these mRNAs often lack secondary structure in their translation initiation regions, suggesting that local unfoldedness of the RNA may determine start codon recognition in Shine-Dalgarno-independent translation. The researchers also used reporter gene constructs to confirm that local RNA unfoldedness is necessary and sufficient for initiation of protein biosynthesis in the absence of an SD sequence. The study provides a plausible mechanism for how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in the absence of a ribosome-binding site.
This study aims to describe the characteristics of patients who returned to a treatment program for leishmaniasis in India after being treated for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL is a parasitic disease that can cause serious health problems, and PKDL is a skin condition that may develop following treatment for VL. The study is based on data from a treatment program in Bihar, India, which used a new treatment called Ambisome. The treatment program treated 8,749 patients with VL, and all patients received health education about the possibility and symptoms of PKDL. Of the patients who completed their first treatment for VL, 24 patients later returned to the treatment program with symptoms of PKDL. The study found that the median time to developing symptoms of PKDL was 1.2 years after treatment, and there were no predictive risk factors for developing PKDL. This study provides important information about PKDL following treatment with Ambisome, which is a new and effective treatment for VL.
Chagas disease is a disease caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by a type of bug called Triatoma infestans. In order to prevent the spread of Chagas disease, it is important to understand how the bugs re-establish after insecticide spraying. This study compares different methods of estimating the probability of bug establishment in different locations and shows that new bug populations establish more often from May to November than from November to May, which coincides with a seasonal increase in dispersal distance. In addition, the study shows that the probability of bug establishment increases with time since the last infestation was detected. These findings challenge our current understanding of T. infestans ecology and highlight the need for further research to understand how to control the spread of this disease.
Polyomaviruses are a family of small, non-enveloped DNA-containing viruses that infect humans. They can cause a variety of health problems, especially in people with weakened immune systems. SV40 is the type species of the virus family and is often used as a model cancer virus. Syrian golden hamsters have been widely used as a model for studying SV40 infections and oncogenesis. In this study, we looked at the patterns of acute and persistent SV40 infections in Syrian golden hamsters. We found that all SV40 strains we tested established persistent infections in the hamsters. The most common sites of infection were the liver and kidneys, but the virus was also found in other tissues. We also found that the presence of a microRNA region in the SV40 genome did not affect the levels of infection in the hamsters. However, we did find that the structure of the regulatory region of the virus had a modest effect on infection levels. We did not find any evidence that the presence of a microRNA affected tumor induction. Our results provide new information about the patterns of SV40 infections in a natural host and suggest that the structure of the virus may play a role in determining where and how the virus replicates.
A group of scientists recently published an article in Nature that used data from six high-coverage genome assemblies for eutherian mammals to search for positively selected genes (PSGs). The six species included in the study were human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, and dog. The scientists used phylogenetic and population genetic methods to analyze the genomes and identify PSGs. They found that approximately 400 genes showed strong evidence of positive selection, and an additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. The identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. The scientists also used a detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data to show that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels and in a more tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs. They also found that genes specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.
We have discovered a new extracellular fibril structure in the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus that promotes biofilm integrity. These fibers are made up of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs), which are typically involved in biofilm disassembly. However, when the PSMs form fibers, they become more resistant to disassembly by enzymes or mechanical stress. These fibers have amyloid-like properties, and our research could lead to new approaches in treating persistent biofilm associated infections.
Chagas disease, also known as American Trypanosomiasis, is a serious condition that affects millions of people worldwide. The disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by a triatomine insect bite, blood transfusion, or ingestion of contaminated food. To monitor the efficacy of treatments and to track the persistence of infection, scientists have developed a new assay that measures specific antibodies to the parasite. This assay has been tested on over 1,600 patients with chronic Chagas disease, and has identified a new biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence. This biomarker could be used to monitor the efficacy of treatments and to track the progression of the disease.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a virus that can cause severe joint and muscle pain and a type of arthritis. This study has found that the virus can persist in the body for months to years after the initial infection. The study created a new type of CHIKV that could be tracked over time. This virus caused a type of arthritis in mice that lasted for several weeks after the initial infection. The researchers used a special kind of mouse that could show where the virus was present in the body and which cells were infected. The study provides a new way to study the long-term effects of CHIKV on the body.
In this paper, the authors investigate how the multi-dimensional structure of neural population activity gives rise to brain function. They use factor analysis (FA), a statistical technique for dimensionality reduction, to measure shared variability in neural population activity and the prominence of this shared variability in the spiking activity. They found that the scaling properties of the non-clustered and clustered networks differ and that in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Furthermore, the authors found that recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. Overall, the findings suggest that the results obtained using a limited number of neurons and trials are informative of the larger network from which they are sampled, and that the underlying network structure influences the outputs of dimensionality reduction.
In this study, the authors examined how a molecule called 2-AA produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa affects host immune responses. They found that 2-AA stimulates key innate immune response pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor ( NF ) -κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but attenuates immune response activation upon pretreatment. 2-AA host pretreatment is characterized by a transcriptionally regulated block of c-JUN N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and NF-κB activation, with relatively preserved activation of extracellular regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1/2. These kinase changes lead to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β ( c/EBPβ ) activation and formation of the c/EBPβ-p65 complex that prevents NF-κB activation. The authors suggest that 2-AA's ability to signal bacteria to switch to a chronic infection mode may be related to its aptitude for dampening the inflammatory processes while increasing host survival and pathogen persistence.
This paper traces the evolution of L1TD1, a gene that originated from a LINE-1 (L1) retroelement. Human L1TD1 is important for pluripotency maintenance, and it has been exapted from a retroelement. The study finds that L1TD1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. L1TD1 has evolved under positive selection during primate and mouse evolution. The prosimian L1TD1 has ‘replenished’ itself with a more recent L1 ORF1 from the prosimian genome. These data suggest that L1TD1 could have originally evolved for genome defense against L1 elements, and later for pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. The study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology, and that such domesticated genes can adopt different functions in different lineages.
YbeY is a highly conserved protein that is important for the processing of the critical 3′ end of 16 S rRNA and for ribosome quality control in bacteria. Loss of YbeY in Escherichia coli leads to severe sensitivity to various physiological stresses, but it is not essential for survival. However, YbeY is essential for Vibrio cholerae, a human pathogen that causes cholera. This protein is crucial for virulence, stress regulation, RNA processing, and ribosome quality control. YbeY is also part of a set of core RNases essential in most representative pathogens.
This study examines the relationship between the topology of transcription factor networks (TFNs) and the robustness of their gene expression phenotypes. A transcription factor is a protein that binds to DNA to regulate the expression of its target genes. When some of the targets are also transcription factors, the resulting regulatory relationships form a transcription factor network (TFN). TFNs play important roles in development and differentiation, and have been studied in a range of organisms including bacteria, yeast, sea urchins, and humans. The study found that all TFNs share a common assortativity signature, and that this signature is important for the robustness of TFNs to genetic perturbation. The four components of the assortativity signature were also examined, and it was found that each component contributes to the phenotypic robustness of TFNs. The study used publicly available data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types. This provides valuable insights into the structure and function of TFNs, and has important implications for understanding the robustness of gene expression phenotypes in human cells. Overall, this study shows that the topology of TFNs can provide important insights into the stability of gene expression phenotypes and their ability to cope with genetic and environmental perturbations.
In this study, researchers recorded the activity of a large number of neurons (up to 74) in the somatosensory barrel cortex of rats while they were stimulated with different whiskers at different frequencies. They then analyzed the information content of these neurons and found that inhibitory neurons processed sensory information more efficiently than excitatory neurons, especially in granular and infra-granular layers. This suggests that inhibitory neurons play a crucial role in shaping network activity, especially when processing restricted sets of stimuli.
The paper aims to create a new kind of computer using living cells. This is called a "biocomputer" and it uses "regulatory RNAs" to program the living cells to perform specific functions. RNAs are small molecules found in cells that can carry information. The researchers have created a "genetic half adder" that can perform basic arithmetic operations to add two bits of information. They have also created a system that uses riboregulators of translation initiation to control the process and transcription factors to sense the molecular signals. This genetic half adder could be useful in scenarios where there is synergy between molecules.
Researchers have found that a specific protein called cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II) helps to keep the right balance of different types of nucleotides in the cell by breaking down some of them. This is important because if there is too much of one type of nucleotide, it can disrupt the normal function of the cell. However, if cN-II is expressed at a high level in patients being treated with certain types of drugs, it can make the drugs less effective. To find ways to make the drugs more effective, researchers have looked at ribonucleoside phosphonates, which are chemically stable and don't break down easily. They have used computer modeling to identify six compounds that might be better ligands (things that bind to the protein) than the natural substrate of cN-II, and then tested those compounds in experiments to see if they actually inhibit cN-II. They found that the compounds did indeed inhibit cN-II, and that the strength of the inhibition depended on three specific residues in the protein. Overall, this study suggests that ribonucleoside phosphonates could be useful in developing new drugs that are more effective against cancer or other diseases.
Prion disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects sheep, cattle, and humans. The disease occurs when a normal protein (PrPc) in the brain is converted into an abnormal form (PrPSc) that accumulates in tissues. A recent study found that PrPSc was present in mammary secretions from scrapie-affected sheep, raising concern about the potential for PrPSc to be present in milk. In this study, infectivity was found in colostrum and milk from sheep incubating natural scrapie, several months before clinical onset, and was also detected in lacteal ducts and mammary acini. The study also found that PrPSc accumulation was associated with the presence of mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles. However, prion infectivity was found in milk and colostrum not only from sheep with lesion-free mammary glands but also from those displaying lesion-free mammary glands. Infectivity was found in the cellular, cream, and casein-whey fractions of milk and colostrum. The highest per ml infectious titre measured in this study was equivalent to that contained in 6 µg of a posterior brain stem from a terminally scrapie-affected ewe. This study provides evidence that both colostrum and milk from sheep incubating TSE could contribute to the transmission process of TSE, either directly or through the presence of milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs. This raises concerns about the risk of human exposure to TSE associated with milk products from ovine and other TSE-susceptible dairy species.
During the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia, which lasted from March 2014 to January 2016, data was collected on people who were suspected, probable, or confirmed cases of EVD. The data was collected by the Liberian government using Microsoft Excel, the Epi-Info Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Application, and DHIS 2. However, the surveillance and reporting systems failed during the outbreak, leading to inadequate data management, including missing and duplicate data. When a person was suspected or probable case of EVD, they were transferred to an Ebola Treatment Unit, where they were interviewed again to confirm their status. Blood and oral swab samples from suspected and probable cases were sent to EVD diagnostic laboratories within the country for the detection of EBOV RNA by nucleic acid tests. Using data from the diagnostic laboratories, we could distinguish between patients who tested positive for EBOV RNA (confirmed cases) and those who tested negative for EBOV RNA (EBOV RNA-negative suspected cases). We analyzed data from the EVD diagnostic laboratories on samples that were tested between April 4, 2014 and March 29, 2015.
Tyrosinase ( EC 1 . 14 . 18 . 1 ) is a copper-containing enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of phenol to the corresponding ortho-quinone. Streptomyces castaneoglobisporus tyrosinase was isolated and cloned by our group. The crystal structures of the S . castaneoglobisporus tyrosinase in its met form ( Cu ( II ) –bound form) were determined at very high resolutions of 1 . 33- and 1 . 71-Å, respectively. The crystal structures demonstrated the presence of two molecules in the active site of tyrosinase, one oxygen atom between the copper ions, and the Tyr98 residue of the caddie protein is present in the active site pocket of tyrosinase. The formation of μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper ( II ) and Cu ( II ) –dopasemiquinone intermediates leads to the hydroxylation reaction, which is triggered by the movement of CuA, inducing the syn-to-anti rearrangement of the copper ligands after the formation of μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper ( II ) core. This allows the electrophilic attack to the aromatic ring by the Cu2O2 oxidant.
This paper is about the early steps of ribosome production, which happens in the nucleolus of eukaryotic cells. The authors focus on a specific stage of ribosome production in yeast cells. In this stage, 30 different proteins called assembly factors (AFs) help make the ribosome. One of these AFs, called Dbp6p, is believed to be important for the formation of the first pre-60S particle. However, it is not clear how Dbp6p helps make the ribosome or how it works with the other AFs. The authors used several techniques to study Dbp6p and its interactions with other AFs. They found that Dbp6p works with a group of four other AFs, including Npa1p, Npa2p, Nop8p, and Rsa3p. They also found that Npa1p is essential for the formation of the first pre-60S particle and plays a key role in the formation of the ribosome.
This study looked at how the brain processes new information and adapts to changes in the environment. The brain has a system that helps us adapt to new information by adjusting the way we learn from it. The study examined how the brain processes new information and adjusts our learning to the new information. The study found that the brain's catecholamine system, which produces chemicals like dopamine and norepinephrine, is important for the brain to adjust to new information. The study used brain imaging technology and mathematical models to analyze how the brain processes information. The study found that the brain's catecholamine system helps the brain adjust to new information by changing the way it processes information. The study also found that the brain's catecholamine system is especially important when the environment changes suddenly and unexpectedly. The study used a special drug to change the activity of the catecholamine system and found that it affected how the brain adapts to new information. This study provides new evidence for how the brain processes information and adjusts to changes in the environment.
Infectious diseases are a major problem for humanity and require continuous monitoring. To this end, several surveillance strategies have been developed, such as disease-specific, syndromic and event-based surveillance. Various data sources are also available for infectious disease surveillance, including the Internet, drug sales reports, notifications from sentinel surveillance, notifiable diseases reports, and microbiology orders reports. Point-Of-Care (POC) laboratories are on-site, around-the-clock operating laboratories equipped with rapid diagnostic tests that can deliver diagnosis within a few hours. They can be easily implemented in developing countries and have the potential to be cheaper and more cost-effective than conventional laboratories. Two POC laboratories have been successfully implemented in the rural Saloum region of Senegal, and a homemade syndromic surveillance system called EPIMIC has been implemented to monitor infectious diseases diagnosed in these laboratories. EPIMIC has been successfully implemented and used in Senegal, West Africa.
The ability of cells to function together is a key characteristic of multi-cellular systems. How cells communicate with each other and how this communication affects their function is not fully understood. In this study, we used a combination of computer modeling, plasma lithography, and pharmacological inhibition to investigate the role of cell structure in calcium signaling and cell contraction in response to histamine stimulation. We found that calcium oscillations occur in self-assembled and microengineered networks of endothelial cells under histamine stimulation, but not in individual cells or monolayers. This suggests that the architecture of the cell network affects the ability of cells to communicate and respond to stimuli. We also found that the number of neighboring cells involved in gap junctional intercellular communication is important for the frequency of calcium oscillations. This suggests that the number of cells that are able to communicate with each other affects the overall response of the cell network. Our results suggest that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the architecture of the vascular network via collective calcium signaling. This information can be useful for understanding and treating diseases that affect vascular networks, such as hypertension and atherosclerosis.
The goal of this study is to understand how RSV causes respiratory illness in infants. Previously, researchers used a method called phage display to identify the different parts of RSV that the body produces antibodies against following infection. These antibodies can help the body fight against RSV. In this study, the researchers tested the different parts of RSV identified in the previous study to see which ones provide the best protection against RSV infection. They did this by immunizing rabbits and mice with different parts of RSV and then challenging them with a strain of RSV. The researchers found that several different parts of RSV provided protection against infection. They also found that these different parts of RSV work in different ways to protect against infection. Specifically, they found that some parts of RSV help to control the spread of infection, while others help to reduce the severity of the infection. Overall, the study provides evidence that multiple parts of RSV can provide protection against infection and suggests that these parts of RSV could be used to develop a vaccine against RSV.
During embryonic development, a number of genetic cues act to generate neuronal diversity. While intrinsic transcriptional cascades are well-known to control neuronal sub-type cell fate, the target cells can also provide critical input to specific neuronal cell fates. These signals, denoted retrograde signals, are known to provide critical survival cues for neurons and also trigger terminal differentiation of neurons. In this study, we focus on the role of RNA processing during target-derived signaling. We found that two genes, brr2 and Prp8, play crucial roles in controlling the expression of the FMRFa neuropeptide specifically in six neurons of the VNC (Tv4 neurons). Detailed analysis of brr2 revealed that this control is executed by two independent mechanisms: (1) proper axonal pathfinding to the target tissue in order to receive the BMP ligand and (2) proper RNA splicing of two genes in the BMP pathway. These results reveal involvement of specific RNA processing in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system.
The abundance of certain proteins that help the cell dispose of waste is tightly controlled to keep the right balance of different protein complexes that are responsible for cleaning up. When this balance is disrupted, cells can become confused about which waste to get rid of, leading to problems like cancer. Scientists have found a new way that one of these proteins, called Met30, is controlled in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that this protein can be broken down in a new way that is independent of Skp1, a key player in the original pathway that controls the abundance of Met30. This new pathway helps cells respond to heavy metal stress and maintain the stability of their chromosomes.
Kinesin motors transport materials in neurons and other cells by moving along microtubules, which are like rails. Kinesin motors are kept inactive when no material is available to transport. Two different models have been proposed to explain how kinesin motors are turned on and start moving. One model says that kinesin motors are activated by dimerization (linking together of two motors) when material is available. The other model says that kinesin motors are activated by an internal mechanism that is turned off in the absence of material. In this study, researchers tested these two models on kinesin-3 motors, which are used to transport synaptic vesicles in neurons. They found that kinesin-3 motors are dimeric (linked together) even when there is no material to transport. Therefore, the researchers concluded that the second model (autoinhibition) is correct. They also found that only dimeric motors can move processively (in a continuous manner) along microtubules, which means that kinesin-3 motors might be uniquely suited to transport materials over long distances in neurons.
The article presents a study that uses advanced techniques to understand the genetic regulation of seed metabolism in tomato plants. The authors investigated the regulation of seed metabolism by applying metabolite profiling and network analysis to a collection of 76 different tomato plants. They found that amino acid contents exhibited high variability across the population, while sugars showed significant seasonal fluctuations. The analysis showed that the genotypic background was the main factor for metabolic polymorphism, and that the seed metabolic network displayed tighter interdependence of metabolic processes than the fruit network. The study highlights the value of integrating metabolic network analysis with other techniques to understand the genetic regulation of seed metabolism.
Vibrio cholerae is a bacterial pathogen that infects both marine animals and humans. In order to survive and spread, it uses a protein called GlcNAc binding protein A (GbpA) to bind to specific molecules on the surfaces of its hosts. In this study, researchers have determined the structure of GbpA and found that it has an unusual, elongated four-domain structure. Two of these domains appear to be responsible for binding chitin, while the other two domains are responsible for binding the surface of Vibrio cholerae. Complementation studies with truncated forms of GbpA have identified the domains responsible for binding mucin and causing infection in a mouse model.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in suppressing Teff cells in pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). They found that Treg cells from adults with PTB preserve their suppressive potential, but Teff cells from these subjects are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression. This resistance is due to the expansion of an activated Teff subset identified by the presence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR expression. Sensitivity to suppression was restored to control levels by depleting this subset. The researchers used RNA sequencing to identify putative resistance mechanisms linked to IFNG, IL17A, IL22, PD-L1, and β-chemokines. They also found that HLA-DR+ Teff cells from patients with PTB were resistant to Treg-mediated suppression through CCR5 and PD-L1 pathways. These findings suggest that HLA-DR+ Teff cells contribute to inflammation and loss of Treg-mediated homeostasis in PTB.
Scientists investigated how prion strains behave in mice that lack the anchor to attach PrPSc to the cell membrane. They found that some prion strains accumulated more in different parts of the brain than in wild-type mice. The strains behaved differently in the mice, with one strain being stably propagated in wild-type mice. The scientists suggest that the high activation energy barrier to convert one conformation of PrPSc to another is broken in mice that lack the anchor, leading to the formation of a new strain.
The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway is a crucial part of development in many species. In flies, it helps to pattern the dorsal ectoderm during embryonic development. In this study, researchers used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to investigate the transcriptional network that underlies dorsal ectoderm differentiation in response to BMP signaling. They identified multiple target genes and enhancers, and found that the EGF pathway negatively regulates BMP-responsive transcription. They also showed roles for the Zelda, Zerknüllt, and BEAF-32 insulator proteins in interpreting the BMP gradient. Overall, their findings help to understand how BMP signaling regulates epidermal fate during dorsal-ventral axis patterning.
In Tunisia, a country in North Africa, a disease called "Leishmaniasis" is spreading. This disease is caused by a parasite that lives in the skin of humans and animals. The parasite is spread to humans by tiny insects called sandflies. Scientists are studying the genetics of the parasites to better understand how the disease is spreading. They are looking at the genes of the parasites collected from different parts of Tunisia over time. The scientists found that the parasites in Tunisia are changing over time and there is movement of these parasites between different parts of Tunisia. The scientists hope that this information will help them to better understand the disease and how to stop it from spreading.
In this study, the authors evaluated the impact of different packages of interventions on the prevalence of helminth infections in HIV-infected adults. They found that treatment with albendazole was effective in reducing the prevalence of any helminth species, while treatment with praziquantel was effective in reducing the prevalence of schistosomiasis. WASH interventions, such as improved sanitation and safe flooring, did not significantly reduce the prevalence of helminth infections, but did significantly reduce the intensity of infections. Overall, the authors found that deworming is effective in reducing the prevalence of helminth infections, but WASH interventions do not significantly improve the effectiveness of deworming.
Bacteriocins are small proteins that certain bacteria produce to kill other bacteria. These proteins are divided into two main types: R- and S-type pyocins, and putidacin A or LlpABW. R-pyocins are complexes that attach to the surface of bacterial cells and then insert their core structure through the cell membrane, causing the membrane to depolarize. S-pyocins are similar to E. coli colicins and kill cells by nucleic acid degradation, membrane damage, or inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis. Putidacin A, or LlpABW, is a type of bacteriocin that was first identified in Pseudomonas putida. Additional genes encoding this type of bacteriocin were later found in other bacteria, including Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas syringae. LlpABW is a protein with two domains that are related to a group of proteins called lectins. These domains are used by the protein to bind to the surface of other bacterial cells and kill them. The structure of this protein has been determined using X-ray crystallography. The protein has a unique structure that is different from other members of the lectin family. This structure is important for its ability to bind to and kill bacteria.
In this study, the authors have identified a novel protein complex that helps a cell called the "forespore" to survive during the process of spore formation. The forespore is surrounded by two membranes and is divided from the mother cell by a thick wall. Previously, it was known that the mother cell and forespore share an intercellular communication pathway to coordinate the developmental process. In this study, the authors showed that this communication pathway is made up of a protein complex that includes proteins from both the mother cell and the forespore. This protein complex is critical for maintaining the integrity of the forespore and is required for spore formation. The authors also discovered that some of the proteins in this complex share similarity with specialized secretion systems found in other bacteria. They further showed that the forespore uses these proteins to obtain nutrients from the mother cell through a secretion process. The authors concluded that the protein complex they identified in this study is an important part of the intercellular communication pathway in Bacillus subtilis and is critical for the survival of the forespore during the spore formation process.
A recent study used a new approach to identify genetic factors for bipolar disorder (BD), a mental disorder characterized by extreme mood swings. The researchers compared genetic data from 1,190 BD cases and 401 controls to those of 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls. They did not find any genome-wide significant associations with individual loci, but they did detect an association between the power to detect genetic effects and replication. They concluded that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons (genes' coding regions) that could be identified in larger studies.
This article presents a new way to analyze how different genes contribute to the growth of cancer cells. In the past, scientists have used a technique called "knockdown" to see how the loss of certain genes affects the growth of cancer cells. However, this technique has limitations and can be unreliable. To overcome these limitations, the authors of this article developed a new method that uses a "Proliferation Index" (PI) to measure how the expression levels of different genes are associated with the growth rate of cancer cells. The authors found that genes that are essential for cancer cell growth have a positive PI, while genes that are essential for non-cancerous cell growth have a negative PI. They also found that certain cellular processes, such as cell cycle and DNA replication, are positively associated with cancer proliferation, while other processes, such as cell migration, are negatively associated with it. These findings provide valuable information that could be used to develop new anti-cancer drugs.
The article describes a rare condition called cystic echinococcosis, which can affect the heart and vena cava. This is a parasitic disease that is caused by a tapeworm called Echinococcus granulosus. People become infected when they accidentally swallow the tapeworm eggs from contaminated food or water. The parasite then spreads throughout the body and can cause a variety of symptoms. The article reports on 11 patients who were diagnosed with cardiac and/or endovascular cystic echinococcosis over a period of 15 years. They experienced symptoms such as thoracic pain or dyspnea, but some patients were asymptomatic. The article also describes the different diagnostic methods that were used to diagnose and follow up on the patients, such as echocardiography, serology, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, and histology. The article reports that nine of the patients underwent cardiac surgery and nine received long-term antiparasitic treatment. One patient died intra-operatively due to cyst rupture and endovascular dissemination. Two other patients died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis, due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure, respectively. One patient was lost to follow-up. The article also describes the different complications that can arise from cystic echinococcosis, such as potentially lethal complications and chronic complications, and how they vary depending on the cyst location. The article concludes that CE should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in patients from endemic areas, and it recommends a combination of surgical and medical management for these patients.
The Toll/interleukin-1 receptor ( TIR ) domain in Toll-like receptors ( TLRs ) is important for initiating and propagating the eukaryotic innate immune signaling cascade . In a recent study, the authors identified a new TIR-like protein in the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, called TirS . They found that ectopic expression of TirS in eukaryotic cells inhibited TLR signaling by downregulating the NF-kB pathway through inhibition of TLR2 , TLR4 , TLR5 , and TLR9 . They also found that skin lesions induced by the S . aureus knockout tirS mutant increased in a mouse model compared with wild-type and restored strains, even though the tirS-mutant and wild-type strains did not differ in bacterial load. TirS was associated with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity, confirming a central role in virulence attenuation through local inflammatory responses . The authors also found that TirS was located within the staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes ( SCCs ) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance but not always carrying the mecA gene . They also found that sub-inhibitory concentration of fusidic acid increased tirS expression. The authors note that epidemiological studies identified no link between this effector and clinical presentation but showed a selective advantage with a SCCmec element with SCC fusC/tirS . They conclude that two key traits determining the success and spread of bacterial infections are linked.
The study by the authors explores the differences in embryonic development between mosquitoes and fruit flies. The authors compare gene expression data from the embryonic development of both species and identify genes that are expressed differently between them. One such group of genes is expressed specifically in the mosquito serosa, a tissue that is absent in fruit flies. The study also reveals a striking difference in the temporal expression of a subset of maternal genes. These findings suggest that the unique gene expression patterns between mosquitoes and fruit flies may be responsible for their distinct embryonic morphologies. The study provides a framework for identifying the genetic circuits underlying embryonic diversity.
The research aimed to investigate the presence of DNA from Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp . pertenue in the skin of asymptomatic children in Papua New Guinea. These bacteria are known to cause leg ulcers in children in certain parts of Africa and the Pacific Islands. The researchers performed a cross-sectional study and swabbed the skin of participants for H. ducreyi and T. p. pertenue DNA. They found that 16 out of 78 asymptomatic participants had H. ducreyi-PCR positivity. They also found that 9 out of 17 flies tested had H. ducreyi DNA. The results suggest that H. ducreyi may be ubiquitous in the environment and may contribute to the spread of the disease. The research highlights the need for further studies to understand the potential role of the environment and flies in the transmission of these bacteria.
Bioinformatics is a crucial aspect of biomedical research and healthcare, but there is disagreement in the field over what the essential knowledge base entails and how best to provide it. This report describes the current status of the core competencies developed by the Curriculum Task Force of the International Society of Computational Biology Education Committee, which aim to cut across many user personas and training programs. It includes a series of use cases illustrating how the competencies are being applied in diverse training contexts, such as bioinformatics engineer and user training. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans, including engaging with more diverse populations to ensure the competencies are comprehensive and relevant to all users.
This study aims to understand the mechanisms behind the arrest and activation of the infectious form, known as L3i, of a parasitic nematode called Strongyloides stercoralis. The authors found that while many of the genes involved in L3i development are similar to those found in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are also several differences. They also identified specific pathways that may be involved in the regulation of L3i development in S. stercoralis. These findings could lead to new treatment and control strategies for the parasite.
Humans are often exposed to genotoxins from bacteria that can cause digestive cancers, including colibactin and Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT), which are produced by many pathogenic bacteria. Our study aimed to evaluate the effects of these genotoxins on nuclear remodeling and their role in cell survival. To do this, we used mouse models, coculture experiments with bacteria that produce CDT and colibactin, and cells from the liver, intestine, and stomach. Our results showed that CDT and colibactin cause nuclear remodeling, which is associated with the formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of giant cells. These structures, observed both in vitro and in vivo, are called nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR), which concentrate ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and the main components of the complex mCRD involved in mRNA turnover. These structures are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with a high degree of ploidy, and involve MAPK and calcium signaling. We found that the insulation and concentration of these adaptive ribonucleoprotein particles within the nucleus are dynamic, transient, and protect the cell until the genotoxic stress is relieved. Bacterial genotoxins-induced NR would be a privileged gateway for selected mRNA to be preferably transported therein for local translation. These findings provide new insights into the context of NR formation, which is a common feature of many cancers and appears not only in response to therapies-induced DNA damage but also earlier in response to genotoxic bacteria.
This study aimed to evaluate the bone deformation of the maxilla in patients who have had leprosy using 3D CT. Previous studies have only evaluated these deformities using visual grading, and no objective or morphometric evaluation has been performed. The maxilla is the bone that supports the structures of the external nose, so changes in the maxilla can affect the shape of the nose and face. There is a need to quantify the precise morphological changes in the maxilla in order to develop corrective treatments for facial deformities caused by leprosy. In this study, 3D CT images of the maxilla were reconstructed using VR and MPR in patients with a history of leprosy and control subjects. These findings were compared with maxillary deformities described in paleopathological studies. After standardization and comparison of leprotic and control data, we succeeded in quantifying the thickness of the maxillary bone defects that require reconstructive surgery.
Our ears pick up sounds in a world with a lot of background noise. To understand these sounds, the brain has to create representations of them that are not affected by background noise. Previous research shows that sounds are represented differently in different parts of the brain. In the peripheral auditory system, sounds are represented in terms of their physical properties, including the noise. In the higher auditory areas of the brain, sounds are represented in a way that is more context-independent and categorical. However, we know very little about the neural computations that are used to build these noise-invariant sound representations. We also know that individual auditory neurons change their responses depending on the context in which the sound is presented. In this study, we used complex synthetic and natural sounds, and recorded neural responses in the inferior colliculus and primary fields of the auditory cortex in anesthetized ferrets. We also created a model of the auditory nerve. We found that the strength of adaptation to the mean and contrast of stimulation increases as we move up the auditory pathway from the auditory nerve to the auditory cortex. To investigate whether this adaptation to stimulus statistics contributes to noise-tolerant sound representations, we presented complex sounds in the presence of background noise and used a decoding approach to measure how well these sounds could be reconstructed from the population responses. We found that noise tolerance of the population code increased as we moved up the auditory pathway, and was correlated with the strength of adaptation to stimulus statistics. This suggests that the increase in adaptation to sound statistics from auditory nerve to midbrain to cortex is an important stage in the construction of noise-invariant sound representations in the higher auditory brain.
Heat shock, a stress response, was analyzed using yeast as a model organism. Yeast's protein-protein interaction network was calculated based on changes in mRNA expression levels. The main finding was that heat shock caused a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections of yeast interactome modules. The weighted diameter of the yeast interactome increased by 4.9-fold. Heat shock caused the yeast interactome to change from a globally connected organization to a multifocal organization. This partial disintegration of the global structure of the yeast interactome may be a general system-level adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.
Chagas disease is a serious health problem in Latin America and is caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi . It can lead to a wide range of complications, including heart disease and arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats). Amiodarone is a drug that is often used to treat arrhythmias, and there have been studies done to see if it is effective in patients with Chagas disease. This review looked at the available evidence from different studies, and it found that amiodarone can reduce ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. However, the review also found that amiodarone is associated with a number of adverse effects, including corneal microdeposits, gastrointestinal events, sinus bradycardia, dermatological events, and drug discontinuation. The review also found that there is no evidence that amiodarone can reduce sudden death or hospitalization in patients with Chagas disease. Overall, the review suggests that while amiodarone may be effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas disease, the potential benefits and harms of using the drug should be carefully considered before making a decision.
Mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya, and Zika are more common during certain times of the year. Climate and human behavior are two factors that can influence seasonal patterns of these diseases. This study aimed to determine seasonal patterns of dengue fever in Ecuador using data from patients clinically diagnosed with the disease at two hospitals. The study found that dengue fever had a single peak in case diagnoses during mid-March. Public holidays did not significantly impact diagnoses, except for an increase in diagnoses on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. The study also found that climate variables such as monthly total precipitation, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly absolute minimum temperature, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly precipitation days, and a three-way interaction between minimum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation days were important predictors of dengue diagnoses. This study is significant because it is one of few reports from rural patients and one of very few studies utilizing daily disease reports. The findings can inform local disease prevention efforts, public health planning, and global and regional models of dengue fever trends.
A study found that expressing a picornavirus replication protein called RdRP in mice or human cells can trigger a long-lasting, powerful immune response that protects against many types of viruses. This immune response is mediated by the MDA5 pathway, a type of innate immune response that does not require prior knowledge of a virus. This protection against viruses did not harm the mice or make them sick. The researchers say this could be a way to protect people from many different types of viruses without causing autoimmune diseases.
We report a complete study of the infection dynamics of the plant RNA virus Tobacco etch virus (TEV) upon inoculation of different host plants (Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum) at different doses (viral RNA molecules). Our study reveals that the number of foci of primary infection in the inoculated leaf is dose-dependent, with lower doses resulting in less foci. Moreover, the number of foci of primary infection is also dose-dependent in systemically infected plants. The probability of systemic infection is approximately 1, and the size of the population of virus in the systemic tissues can be predicted from the number of foci of primary infection. The size of the population of virus in the systemic tissues is therefore very similar to that in the inoculated leaf. These results support the hypothesis that the infection process of TEV is independent of other infecting virions, and that the probability of each virus causing infection is independent of the presence of other viruses. We propose that the probability of infection is a fixed parameter of the host, and that each virus acts independently of the other viruses. Our study provides strong evidence for the independent-action hypothesis of micro-parasite infection, and this hypothesis appears to be valid for mono-partite plant RNA viruses. Our study also provides estimates of the population size of TEV in different hosts at different doses, and these estimates can be used to compare different plant RNA viruses. Our results suggest that the host plays a key role in determining the number of virions that cause primary infection and the subsequent systemic infection. Understanding the infection dynamics of plant RNA viruses is important for controlling plant diseases, and our study provides new insights into how plant RNA viruses infect their hosts.
In this paper, the authors propose a new statistical method called Sparse Bayesian Regression for mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across multiple tissues simultaneously. This method is an extension of the traditional approach of mapping eQTLs in individual tissues, which does not account for the similarities and differences in gene expression across tissues. The authors tested their method on a set of 2,000 genes in four tissues and found that their method was more powerful than traditional methods in revealing the true complexity of the eQTL landscape at the systems level. They also identified a two-eQTL model (cis/trans) for the Hopx gene that was experimentally validated and was not detected by conventional approaches. The authors also found evidence of common genetic regulation of gene expression across four tissues for about 27% of transcripts. These findings provide new insights into the genetic regulation of gene expression at the systems level. The generality of the modeling approach makes it adaptable to other model systems and humans, with broad application to analysis of multiple intermediate and whole-body phenotypes.
The article "Variable-delay, snap-action switching of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway" presents a mathematical model of the extrinsic cell death pathway, which is activated by TNF and TRAIL receptors. The model is based on the mass-action representation of known reaction pathways and has been trained against experimental data. The authors find that the duration of the delay before effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of reactions immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. The model also highlights the importance of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly for snap-action control.
During pregnancy, a special barrier called the placenta protects the fetus from the mother's immune system and harmful pathogens. Bacteria that can get past this barrier, such as Listeria monocytogenes, provide a unique opportunity to understand how the placenta works. In this study, the authors looked at a specific protein called Internalin P (InlP) that is found in L. monocytogenes and that helps the bacteria cross the placenta. They found that InlP binds to a protein called human afadin, which is found in the placenta and helps cells stick together. They also found that InlP helps L. monocytogenes to cross the placental barrier by promoting something called transcytosis, which is when a bacterium moves from the basal side of an infected epithelial monolayer to the apical side. This means that InlP may help L. monocytogenes to infect the fetus. Overall, this study provides important information about how bacteria can cross the placental barrier and how the placenta protects the fetus.
In this study, the authors aimed to better understand the proteome of T. pallidum ssp. pallidum, the bacterial causative agent of syphilis, during infection. They used complementary mass spectrometry techniques to analyze three biological replicates of T. pallidum bacteria harvested from infected rabbits. The authors identified 6033 peptides that correspond to 557 unique T. pallidum proteins at a high level of confidence, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. They found that a total of 116 potential membrane proteins were identified, of which 16 have evidence supporting outer membrane localization. The authors also identified 8/12 proteins related to the paralogous tpr gene family, including TprB, TprC/D, TprE, TprG, TprH, TprI, and TprJ. They semi-quantified protein abundance using label-free spectral counting methods. The study provides the most comprehensive description of the global T. pallidum proteome to date and helps to improve our understanding of the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism.
Protein Kinase A (PKA) is an important signaling molecule in eukaryotic cells. PKA is activated by the secondary messenger cAMP, which binds to two tandem domains within the regulatory subunit of PKA. Our study uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to investigate the two-domain construct RIα (91–379) in its apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms. Our comparative NMR analyses reveal that each apo CBD dynamically samples both active and inactive states independently of the adjacent CBD. The binding of cAMP selectively stabilizes the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts, which require both cAMP and W260, a residue contributed by CBD-B. Our results support a model of double conformational selection in which CBD-B serves as a "gatekeeper" domain that controls the availability of W260 to cAMP bound to CBD-A. The study also reveals that both CBD-A and -B exhibit residual dynamics, even in the presence of cAMP, and that the two tandem CBDs exhibit different dynamics profiles. These findings suggest that conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics and open new opportunities for selective targeting of CBDs for therapeutic purposes.
The study is about a protein called ISG15 that is involved in the antiviral innate immune response. ISG15 can be found in two forms: as a free molecule (intracellular and extracellular) or conjugated to target proteins (ISGylation). ISGylation occurs in a similar manner to the process of ubiquitination, which is also a reversible modification. The study looked at the proteomes of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) that were either ISG15-deficient or ISG15-sufficient, and compared the proteomes after infection with vaccinia virus (VACV). The results showed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) were altered in ISG15-deficient BMDMs treated with IFN. The study also found that ISG15-deficient macrophages had a robust proinflammatory cytokine expression pattern but did not produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) or nitric oxide (NO) in response to IFN treatment. Furthermore, NO release was higher in ISG15-sufficient macrophages than in ISG15-deficient macrophages following IFN treatment, and this was associated with a decrease in viral titer. In conclusion, the study highlights the important role of ISG15 in the dynamic functionality of mitochondria, specifically OXPHOS and mitophagy, which expands its role beyond antiviral defense.
The HIV-1 protein Vpu plays two roles in the virus's replication: it helps in the release of viral particles and it degrades the cellular receptor CD4. Vpu binds to a protein called βTrCP, which helps Vpu to degrade CD4. In this study, the authors found that Vpu is also subject to degradation by the proteasome, which is a complex made of enzymes that help to break down and recycle proteins. They found that Vpu is phosphorylated (which means that a chemical group is added to it) at the serine 61 position, which is next to the βTrCP-binding motif. They also found that this phosphorylation event is required for Vpu to be degraded by the proteasome. However, they did not find that this degradation was mediated by βTrCP, but rather by a different protein. They also found that this degradation decreased the efficiency of Vpu-mediated release of HIV-1 virions, which may help to balance the virus's dissemination and preservation of the infected cell reservoir.
Development is the process through which organisms grow and develop into adults. Tissues are organized in a way that allows them to pattern correctly even when environmental conditions change. There are different hypotheses about how tissue patterning is coordinated with the whole body during development. One hypothesis is that tissue patterning and whole-body development progress synchronously. This means that the rate of tissue patterning matches the rate of whole-body development. Another hypothesis is that tissue patterning is only coordinated with whole-body development at key developmental events, such as moulting. To test these hypotheses, researchers developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae using the expression of key patterning genes. They then used this scheme to explore how the progression of tissue patterning changes when developmental rate is altered either by changing temperature or by altering the timing of hormone synthesis. The researchers found that tissue patterning is coordinated with whole-body development at key developmental events. However, tissue patterning showed greater variability between events. This suggests that tissue patterning is not always coordinated with whole-body development and that it may be important for tissues to have the ability to pattern correctly even when developmental conditions change.
The paper investigates the function of Did2, an ESCRT regulator, in fungal hyphae. ESCRT is a complex protein that helps to recycle materials in the cell, including membranes and proteins. Did2 is important for endosomal transport in fungal hyphae, which are long, branching cells that can grow in many different directions. The authors show that Did2 is important for two processes: long-distance transport and endosomal maturation. Long-distance transport involves moving materials from one part of the cell to another, while endosomal maturation involves changing the properties of endosomes as they move through the cell. The authors suggest that Did2 may be important for coordinating these two processes. They also discuss the importance of Did2 for endosomal mRNP transport, which is the movement of mRNA from one part of the cell to another. Overall, the paper sheds light on the important role of ESCRT in endosomal transport and mRNA transport in fungal hyphae.
Riboswitches are RNA molecules that sense changes in the cell and regulate gene expression accordingly. They have been found in all kingdoms of life, and some even regulate in trans. Riboswitches consist of an aptamer and an expression platform, and many are similar but have a very high specificity and affinity for their ligands. The add riboswitch regulates translation by controlling the formation of a translation sequestrator, while the pbuE riboswitch regulates transcription by attenuating transcription. It has been observed that the add and pbuE riboswitches behave differently in their ligand binding properties. Adenine riboswitches can bind to adenine after transcription is completed, and this can still perform translation regulation. The transcription process dictates the RNA folding pathway, which is important for the regulatory activity of riboswitches. A riboswitch that operates under a kinetic regime requires the rate of ligand binding to be quicker than the rate of transcription, while a riboswitch that operates under a thermodynamic regime requires the rate of ligand binding to be slower than the rate of transcription. It is necessary to characterize more riboswitch representatives to gain a better understanding of their mechanisms of regulation.
The article describes a type of transcription initiation called "primer-dependent initiation" (PDI) that is widely found in bacteria, particularly during the stationary phase of growth. This type of initiation involves using a short oligoribonucleotide to initiate transcription instead of using a new RNA strand as a starting point. The article describes how PDI in Escherichia coli (E. coli) is involved in regulating the formation of biofilms, which are complex communities of microorganisms that form on surfaces. The article also describes how PDI occurs in another type of bacteria called Vibrio cholerae, and provides evidence that the pattern of PDI in this bacteria is similar to the pattern observed in E. coli. The authors propose that a growth phase-dependent process that generates specific oligoribonucleotides may be responsible for PDI in both E. coli and V. cholerae.
We have studied the effect of imbalance in the parental genome dosage in the endosperm of Arabidopsis seeds. Parental imbalance is an evolutionary phenomenon that occurs when two different species of plants are crossed and the resulting offspring is a hybrid of the two species. In this study, we found that increased dosage of the maternal genome caused a decrease in the expression of FIS2, while increased dosage of the paternal genome caused an increase in the expression of FIS2. This finding is surprising, as we expected that increased dosage of the maternal genome would increase the expression of FIS2, while increased dosage of the paternal genome would decrease the expression of FIS2. However, our results suggest that there may be complex interactions between the imprinted genes in the endosperm, which are not yet fully understood. Despite this, our study provides important insights into the complex mechanisms of imprinting in the endosperm.
This paper focuses on brain rhythms that can be recorded by EEG and MEG. These rhythms are caused by different frequencies of brain activity, which can be seen in the power spectrum. The power spectrum is like a map of brain rhythms, showing a non-oscillatory background with frequency bands superimposed on it. These frequency bands are evenly spaced, making it easier for different rhythms to coexist without affecting each other. Researchers have used mathematical tools to study how these rhythms are generated and how they interact with each other. In this paper, the researchers ask a different question: what do these rhythms tell us about the structure and function of the brain? To answer this question, they used mathematical techniques to create "virtual brains" that mimic the rhythms seen in real brains. They found that all the reconstructed virtual brains had similar features, such as certain types of connections between different parts of the brain. They also studied how these virtual brains are affected by diseases like epilepsy and schizophrenia, and found that the altered rhythms in diseased brains were also reflected in the structure and function of the virtual brains. This study provides important insights into how the brain works, and how diseases can affect it.
The study presents a genetic analysis of 1,374 unrelated Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), including self-identification corresponding to Central America, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South America. Using genome-wide genotyping data, the authors performed population structure analysis and identified four distinct subgroups: primarily Central/South American, the Dominican Republic and Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. The authors also performed genetic association analysis on triglyceride levels, using SNPs in the lipoprotein lipase and tribbles homolog 1 gene regions. The study demonstrated the importance of considering population substructure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic association studies performed in the United States Hispanic population. The authors suggest that stratified analysis offers better resolution to detect genetic loci in which SNP effects are limited to or much stronger within a single subgroup of Hispanics. The results of this study may have implications for genetic research on cardiovascular disease and other phenotypes in Hispanic populations.
The study shows that the Elongator complex, which is involved in histone acetylation, is required for transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability. This is done in a pathway linked to DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA. The results suggest that the Elongator complex plays an important role in gene regulation and genome stability.
This research paper introduces a new method for automating the process of manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications. The current process is often time-consuming and expensive, as domain experts must carefully read and select articles to curate. The new method uses machine learning algorithms to classify and rank articles for curation, based on their relevance to the topic. The researchers collected previously curated publications and used them to train deep learning models, which were then applied to the real-world manual curation process of two external knowledge bases. The results showed that the new method outperformed the current query-based method in terms of precision and recall, without compromising the quality of the curated content. The new method is being implemented in production to help human curators focus on more challenging tasks and improve the overall efficiency of the knowledge base curation process.
The human heart is made up of specialized cells called cardiomyocytes that beat together to keep the heart pumping. These cells have an electrical system that controls their contractions, similar to how a computer uses electricity to run. This electrical system is made up of several different types of ion channels that control the flow of charged particles called ions in and out of the cells. Ion channels are like tiny gates that open and close in response to changes in the electrical charge inside the cell. Changes to the function of these ion channels can cause problems with the heart's electrical system, which can lead to abnormal heartbeats, or arrhythmias. There are several different types of arrhythmias, including a group called short QT syndrome, which can lead to life-threatening heart problems. In this study, researchers used computer models to study how changes in a particular type of ion channel called Kir2 .1 can affect the electrical system of the heart. They found that changes to Kir2 .1 channels can cause a type of short QT syndrome called variant 3, which can lead to atrial fibrillation. They also found that different changes to Kir2 .1 channels can cause different types of arrhythmias, and that treatment with certain drugs can help stop these arrhythmias. Overall, this study provides important information about the electrical system of the heart and how changes to ion channels can cause problems.
Chagas disease is a disease caused by a parasite (Trypanosoma cruzi) that can spread through several routes, including blood transfusions, organ transplants, ingestion of contaminated food or drinks, and congenital transmission. The disease is endemic in Central and South America, and it can lead to heart disease and death. The current study investigated whether adult adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) can reduce inflammation and heart damage in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy. The ASC were injected into mice 3 days after infection. The results showed that the ASC significantly reduced the number of parasites in the blood, which was followed by a decrease in inflammation and heart damage. In addition, the ASC caused a change in the response of lymphoid organs to the parasite, which led to a control of parasite burden. The study suggests that ASC may be a useful treatment for chagasic cardiomyopathy.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by parasites that infect and live in the skin of mammals. These parasites live in specialized compartments inside the cells called parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs). Retro-2 is a chemical compound that has been shown to block the formation of these compartments and limit the growth of parasites inside the cells. This study aimed to investigate the effects of structural analogs of Retro-2cycl on the formation of LPVs and the growth of parasites. The analogs DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36 .1 were found to be more effective in limiting the growth of parasites inside the cells than Retro-2cycl. These analogs also caused a reversal in the suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Moreover, they killed the parasites in axenic cultures, which is a desirable attribute for a drug to treat Leishmania infections. These studies validate and extend the published structure-activity relationship analyses of Retro-2cycl .
The nucleosome is a unit of genomic organization made up of DNA wrapped around a protein core. This can act to organize the DNA and keep it compact. The nucleosome may also regulate gene expression. The authors present a method to predict whether a transcription factor is sensitive to nucleosome regulation, and they use this method to identify a transcription factor called AML-1a that is sensitive to nucleosomes in a family of genes called the Ly49 genes. They then confirm that AML-1a is sensitive to nucleosomes in a cell line that naturally expresses the Ly49 genes. This suggests that nucleosome positioning may be involved in regulating the expression of the Ly49 genes.
The cell cycle, a process in which cells prepare to divide, is controlled by proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The activity of CDKs is regulated by a chemical process called phosphorylation, in which phosphate groups are added to certain proteins. Phosphorylation can be catalyzed by an enzyme called a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, the only known CAK for CDK2 and CDK1 is cyclin H-CDK7. In this study, the researchers used chemical-genetics to investigate the role of CDK7 in the activation of CDK4 and CDK6, which are important for cell cycle progression. They discovered that CDK7 is not the only CAK for CDK4 and CDK6. They also found that p21, a protein that regulates the cell cycle, is phosphorylated by CDK4 and CDK2, and that this phosphorylation is important for the activation of CDK4 and p21-dependent cell cycle progression.
The paper discusses the role of a protein called DUET in the process of meiosis in plants. Meiosis is the process by which haploid cells are produced for sexual reproduction. In yeast, a series of genes are activated in a specific order as meiosis progresses. However, the factors controlling this process are not well understood in multicellular eukaryotes. The authors of this paper found that DUET is required for proper meiotic gene expression in Arabidopsis. They discovered that DUET binds to H3K4me2, a type of histone modification, and that this binding is important for its function. The authors also found that DUET is expressed only at a specific stage of meiosis and that its targets are involved in meiotic cell cycle transitions and spindle organization. Overall, their findings suggest that DUET functions as a transcriptional regulator during male meiosis in plants.
Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome ( FXTAS ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting adult men who carry a premutation of the FMR1 gene, a gene that codes for a protein called FMRP. The premutation is a stretch of CGG repeats that is too large but not large enough to cause a full-blown mutation. Although the exact mechanism of how this premutation leads to FXTAS is not clear, it is known that it results in an increase in FMR1 mRNA and a decrease in FMRP. This study used a proteomic approach to identify proteins that interact with Pur α, a protein that has been implicated in FXTAS pathogenesis. The study identified 100 proteins that interact with Pur α, one of which is Rm62, a protein that is known to be involved in stress and immune responses. Further analysis revealed that fragile X premutation rCGG repeats can cause the nuclear accumulation of specific mRNAs, including Hsp70 and other stress response genes. This nuclear accumulation could impair the ability of these genes to be translated into proteins, leading to neuronal apoptosis. Overall, this study suggests that fragile X premutation rCGG repeats cause a deficit in the nuclear export of specific mRNAs, which could predispose neurons to apoptosis.
This article describes the importance of the extracellular matrix in the formation of biofilms, which are communities of bacteria that adhere to each other and to surfaces. The matrix is composed of a variety of substances, including polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. The authors focus on the polysaccharide Psl, which is produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that forms biofilms on many different surfaces. The authors provide detailed information about the structure of Psl and show that it is important for the formation and maintenance of the P. aeruginosa biofilm matrix. They also show that the matrix can change during the development of the biofilm. The authors propose that P. aeruginosa may use programmed cell death and lysis to create a matrix-free area in the center of the microcolony, which is important for future seeding dispersal. This work provides important insights into the process of biofilm development and may help in the development of new strategies for controlling biofilm formation.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly cancer that is difficult to treat and has poor outcomes. To better understand the genetic makeup of PDAC, researchers are using patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO). These models are made by taking a patient's tumor and implanting it into a mouse or cell culture dish, respectively. However, no one has yet analyzed the full genetic profile of these models and compared them to the original patient tumor at the whole-genome level. In this study, researchers analyzed the genetic makeup of 16 pairs of tumors and their corresponding PDX and/or PDO. They found that while these models accurately recapitulate some of the genetic changes in the original tumor, such as mutations in known cancer drivers, they struggle to accurately represent the full range of genetic changes in the tumor, such as structural variations and copy number changes. Additionally, the researchers found that these models may be best suited for studying specific types of genetic changes, depending on their complexity. Overall, the researchers' findings suggest that while these models are useful tools for studying PDAC, they have some limitations that should be considered when interpreting their results.
In this study, researchers aimed to discover new genetic factors that contribute to breast cancer risk. They conducted a four-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls of East Asian descent, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women. They identified 22 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that may contribute to breast cancer risk. The top SNP, rs9485372, located near the TGF-β activated kinase gene, showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of 3.8×10-12 in the combined analysis of all samples. The adjusted odds ratios were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for the A/G and A/A genotypes, respectively, compared with the genotype G/G. Two other SNPs, rs9383951 and rs7107217, located in the ESR1 and 11q24.3 genes, respectively, also showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk in each of the four stages. This study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372 near the TAB2 gene and identifies two possible susceptibility loci located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively.
Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is a major cause of death worldwide, particularly in people with HIV/AIDS. Scientists have studied 230 isolates of the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) from HIV-positive patients in South Africa and found that patients infected with a certain lineage of Cn called VNB had significantly worse survival than those infected with other lineages. This study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic diversity of Cn and how it may be related to patient outcomes.
A new study has discovered the last missing component of a signal transduction pathway in Candida albicans that regulates the pheromone response of the white cell phenotype. Through the construction of an overexpression library for 107 transcription factors and mutational analyses, the researchers found that the transcription factor Tec1 is the last component of this newly evolved signal transduction pathway. The elucidation of this pathway provides a unique perspective on how new signal transduction pathways may evolve and highlights the importance of identifying the origins of components in young signal transduction pathways for a deeper understanding of their evolution.
The genomic GC-content of bacteria varies dramatically, from less than 20% to more than 70%. This variation is generally attributed to differences in the mutation pattern of bacteria, but this theory has not been thoroughly tested. In this study, the authors examined patterns of synonymous polymorphism in 149 bacterial species to test this hypothesis. They found a large excess of synonymous GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations in all but the most AT-rich bacteria. This excess of GC→AT SNPs is inconsistent with mutation bias and suggests that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. This is also evident in the correlation between the GC-content of the first two codon positions of protein coding genes and genomic GC-content. The authors conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria.
Scientists have developed a new approach for mapping the observed prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in Kenya using a Bayesian space-time geostatistical model. They combined data from over 900 cross-sectional surveys conducted in Kenya between 1974 and 2009 to estimate the prevalence of hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura, and mapped the combined prevalence of infection. The model estimated that 2.8 million school-aged children live in districts that warrant mass treatment. The scientists suggest that the model can be used to map STH prevalence in other countries and help guide control efforts.
The article is about a study on the role of innate lymphocytes in immunity against tuberculosis. Innate lymphocytes are a subset of cells that serve as the first line of defense against infection and have a partially activated phenotype. These cells are also known as NK cells and γδ T cells. The article establishes an in vitro model to study the contribution of innate lymphocytes to immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The model involves the culture of splenocytes obtained from uninfected mice with Mtb-infected macrophages. The study shows that the culture secreted IFN-γ, stimulated NOS2 upregulation and NO production, and suppressed intracellular Mtb replication. The article identifies the cellular mechanism that mediates this innate effector function against the intracellular human pathogen Mtb. The findings of the study suggest that innate lymphocytes contribute to immunity against tuberculosis.
Protein assemblies are important in a wide range of biological processes, and covalent bonds can help to stabilize these assemblies. The formation of intra- or intermolecular ε- ( γ-glutamyl ) lysil cross-links is one example of how covalent bonds can be used to stabilize protein assemblies. The formation of these cross-links is catalyzed by transglutaminases ( TGases ). In many cases, the activity of TGases is tightly controlled. In this study, researchers investigated the activity of a TGase ( Tgl ) produced by the bacterial species Bacillus subtilis. Unlike other TGases, Tgl is produced in an active form and efficiently catalyzes amine incorporation and protein cross-linking in vitro with no known additional requirements. The researchers found that the activity of Tgl is spatially restricted to the surface of the developing spore. They also identified specific residues in Tgl that are crucial for its localization, and they showed that the first step in the reaction cycle, the interaction with Q-substrates and formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate, is the determinant step in the localization of Tgl.
Opisthorchis viverrini is a parasite that can cause liver and bile duct diseases, including cholangiocarcinoma, a type of liver cancer. In Lao PDR, it is estimated that 2.5 million people are infected with this parasite, but there are not many studies about where this parasite is found. In this study, we aimed to find out where O. viverrini is found in southern Lao PDR and what factors increase the risk of infection. We used a survey to collect data on demographics, water supply, sanitation, and behavior in 51 villages in Champasack province. We also used satellite data to find out what environmental factors were associated with infection. We used a computer program to map the risk of O. viverrini infection and to identify risk factors. We found that the highest infection rates were in people who lived in the Mekong corridor and in those who ate fish from freshwater sources. We also found that the risk of infection was higher in people who did not have access to sanitation, were older, and belonged to the Lao Loum ethnic group.
The paper is about the mosquito larval habitats in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The authors found that the majority of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam are drains, with aquatic habitats associated with agriculture having the highest proportion of Anopheles larvae presence and the second highest of Culex larvae presence. However, the majority of aquatic habitats were drains, and therefore, 43% (1,364/3,149) of all culicine and 33% (320/976) of all anopheline positive habitats were drains. The authors found that drains with stagnant water had 8.8 times higher odds of containing Anopheles and Culex larvae compared with drains where water was flowing at normal velocity. The authors concluded that drains are important sources of mosquito larval habitats for both LF and malaria vectors. They suggest that restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam has the potential to eliminate more than 40% of all potential mosquito larval habitats that are currently treated with larvicides by the UMCP.
This study investigated the role of lipid metabolism in dengue virus (DENV) replication. The authors found that the HMGCR enzyme, which is responsible for cholesterol synthesis, was activated in DENV-infected cells and this activation was mediated by the inactivation of AMPK. They also found that the cholesterol-rich ER compartments were important for replicative complex formation and that this process was disrupted by inhibition of HMGCR. The authors suggest that HMGCR activation and the disruption of replicative complex formation by HMGCR inhibition could be potential therapeutic targets for DENV infection.
In this article, the authors use molecular dynamics simulations to analyze how the 70S ribosome moves during the process of tRNA translocation. By observing the movement of groups of residues, the authors have identified collective rearrangements that are important for the function of the ribosome. By calculating the effective diffusion of these collective rearrangements, the authors were able to establish a link between experimental rates and the continuous energy landscape of the ribosome. This analysis provides a framework for understanding the physical-chemical properties that dictate the dynamics of the ribosome, and how these properties can be manipulated to control its function.
The genetic changes that occur in a type of cancer called medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) are not fully understood. We studied 84 MTC tumor samples and found that the most common mutation was in a gene called RET, which is a proto-oncogene. We also found mutations in other genes including NRAS, HRAS, KRAS, MET, BRAF, and ALK. Additionally, we performed tests to see if the gene ALK was rearranged. We found that 2 out of 98 cases were positive for ALK rearrangement. We then used DNA from these patients to identify the genomic breakpoint and the 5’ fusion partner of ALK. We discovered that 2 types of ALK fusions occurred: GLFPT1-ALK and EML4-ALK. We confirmed the GLFPT1-ALK fusion through additional PCR and Sanger sequencing. We found that 1 metastatic MTC case that had the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor. Our study suggests that EML4-ALK fusion may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors. Moreover, the GLFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy.
Leishmaniasis is a serious disease caused by a parasite and spread by sand flies. It can be cured with medication and can even be eliminated in some areas. However, a significant challenge to this goal is the presence of "asymptomatic" cases. These are people who have the disease, but do not show any signs or symptoms. It is not clear how many people are asymptomatic, and what the long-term consequences of this condition are. The study aimed to determine the proportion of asymptomatic cases and their risk of developing the disease in a high-risk area in India. This was done by screening 2603 people in eight villages using a rapid diagnostic test. Of those screened, 185 people had antibodies against the parasite, and 79 of them did not have a history of the disease. These 79 people were considered asymptomatic cases. Over the course of the study, some of the asymptomatic cases developed symptoms of the disease, and some became seronegative (no longer showing positive results on the diagnostic test). The study found that the rate of transformation to symptomatic disease among asymptomatic cases was 10.39%, and the rate of sero-conversion was 80.52%. This suggests that asymptomatic cases play an important role in the spread of the disease, and that more attention needs to be paid to them in order to eliminate leishmaniasis.
We found that Ty1-mediated translocations were not randomly distributed in the genome, but rather targeted specific regions on four different chromosomes. Additionally, some of these translocations were formed through a process that does not require the homologous recombination proteins RAD52 or the endonuclease Rad1-Rad10. Finally, we found that defects in the acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) resulted in an increase in both translocations and whole-chromosome duplications, as well as aneuploidy that often occurred simultaneously with GCRs. Our findings suggest that MLPA is a powerful technique for rapidly analyzing GCRs and could be used to identify new pathways that promote genome instability.
Protein docking is a critical computational problem in structural biology and drug discovery. We describe an underestimation-based algorithm called SDU (Semi-definite programming-based Underestimation) that is capable of finding the global minimum of a funnel-shaped free energy function approximating the free energy over regions of the conformational space. The SDU algorithm combines underestimation with biased sampling to guide the search process toward the global minimum. The algorithm was successfully applied to docking using a multistage docking procedure that decomposes the conformational space into separate regions defined by the clusters, where free energy attraction basins are believed to exist and the free energy landscape is assumed to be funnel-like. We compare the performance of SDU with that of a Monte Carlo-based algorithm and show that SDU is able to make substantially fewer function evaluations while maintaining a high level of accuracy.
