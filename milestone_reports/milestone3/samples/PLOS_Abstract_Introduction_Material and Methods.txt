In this article, the authors study the stability of alternative polyadenylation signals in the 3′ untranslated regions (3′ UTRs) of human genes. They used 3′ end RNA-seq data from six human lymphoblastoid cell lines to identify 3′ UTRs of class I, II, and III genes. Class I genes had only one polyadenylation signal (PAS), class II genes had two or more PASs, and class III genes had no PASs. They then used luciferase reporter assays to study the stability of the different PASs in class II genes. They found that the stability of a PAS depends on its location relative to the inferred cleavage site of the transcript. They also found that the stability of the short and long forms of a transcript produced by alternative polyadenylation can be studied by transfection of a construct containing the entire 3′ UTR of the gene into human cells. They used this approach to study the stability of the short and long forms of the EIF2A, IRF5, DIP2B, and NAB1 genes in different human cell lines. They found that the stability of the short and long forms of a gene can be affected by the presence of regulatory elements in the 3′ UTR, and that the stability of the short form can be affected by the presence of a polyadenylation signal in the 3′ UTR.
SIVΔnef, a live attenuated strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), is used as a vaccine to prevent AIDS in macaque monkeys. To understand the T-cell responses induced by SIVΔnef vaccination and how these responses evolve over time, we used deep sequencing to quantify the frequency of SIVΔnef-specific T cells in the animals at two different time points after vaccination. We also used fine-mapping techniques to determine the specificity of the T-cell responses at the epitope level. Our results show that the T-cell responses induced by SIVΔnef vaccination are broad and anentropic, with wider cumulative breadth and rearranged immunodominance. We also show that the depth of the T-cell response increases over time post-vaccination. These findings highlight the unique properties of SIVΔnef vaccination in inducing potent T-cell responses against SIV.
The current article describes the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor signaling in host defense against fungal infections. Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis, the authors show that IL-1 signaling is critical for neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection and for inducing emergency granulopoiesis, which is the rapid expansion of granulocyte-producing bone marrow cells to meet the increased demand for neutrophils in response to infection. They demonstrate that IL-1 signaling regulates the production of neutrophil-chemotactic factors by epithelial cells, which is necessary for neutrophil recruitment to the site of infection. They also show that IL-1 signaling induces G-CSF production by endothelial cells, which is necessary for enhanced neutrophil output from the bone marrow to meet the increased demand in response to infection. Finally, the authors demonstrate that IL-1 signaling is critical for inducing emergency granulopoiesis. They show that neutrophil numbers are significantly reduced in mice lacking IL-1 receptor signaling in response to infection. They also show that IL-1 signaling is necessary for inducing emergency granulopoiesis in response to infection. Taken together, the authors show that IL-1 signaling plays a critical role in host defense against fungal infections by regulating the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection and inducing emergency granulopoiesis, which is necessary for meeting the increased demand for neutrophils in response to infection.
This study estimates the economic benefits of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) between the years 2000-2007. The GPELF delivered more than 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs. The study quantified the resulting economic benefits by calculating the number of clinical manifestations averted and analyzing the savings associated with this disease prevention in the context of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals. The study found that over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF, a total of US$21.8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained. Additionally, more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF will benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease, resulting in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19.5 billion. In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2.2 billion. The study concludes that MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits and that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high.
Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding glucocerebrosidase (GCase). GCase is an enzyme responsible for breaking down glucocerebroside into glucose and ceramide, two major lipid components of the nervous system. Heterozygous mutations in the GCase gene have been linked to an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease. The study of GCase mutations has led to new insights into the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease, and the identification of potential therapeutic targets.
Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a bacteria that can cause foodborne illness in humans. It is able to infect and survive within host cells. In order to understand how the host's immune system responds to Lm infection, scientists have studied its interactions with the immune system using mouse models. They found that Lm is able to trigger an adaptive immune response, but only when it escapes from the phagosome and into the host cell cytosol. If Lm is confined within the phagosome, it suppresses the adaptive immune response, leading to a weakened response against subsequent infections. This suppression is caused by the production of the cytokine IL-10, which limits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. By studying how Lm interacts with the immune system, scientists can better understand how to develop treatments for Lm infections.
We investigated the genetic contribution of SIX6 to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). We sequenced the coding and regulatory regions of SIX6 in a case-control dataset of 262 cases and 256 controls and found six nonsynonymous coding variants, including five rare and one common variant. We tested these variants in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure. We found that one variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation. We also demonstrated that POAG cases homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele had a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele. Our results, in combination with previous SIX6 work, lead us to hypothesize that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells, thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss.

This study provides a detailed description of the sporulation process in the human pathogen C . difficile. By using a combination of cytological and molecular techniques, the authors demonstrate that C . difficile sporulation displays several key differences when compared to sporulation in other Clostridial species. These differences suggest that C . difficile sporulation may be adapted to the specific needs of the organism in its natural habitat. The study also provides a platform for further investigations of the regulatory network of sporulation and the expression of effector genes, many of which will be species-specific and possibly related to host colonization and transmission.
In this study, the authors introduce a simple model to understand the complex behavior of proteins that have multiple phosphorylation sites. This model is based on the idea of "modified fraction" (MF) modeling and reduces the complexity of the system by only taking into account the fraction of modified sites in the protein. The authors use this model to analyze the checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast, which is known to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth. They show that this system can form a robust hysteretic switch, with a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating that sufficient growth has occurred. The authors also provide a mathematical analysis of the system and discuss the implications of their findings. Overall, this study provides a useful framework for understanding the behavior of complex systems with multiple phosphorylation sites.
The study examined the regulatory network of quorum sensing ( QS ) in the bacterium E. coli by combining experimental work and mathematical modeling. The quorum sensing system is a network of genes and proteins that allow bacteria to communicate with each other, coordinate their behavior and survive in an environment that is constantly changing. In this study, the researchers isolated the mechanisms that control the communication between bacteria by separating the regulatory network into sub-networks and examining the interplay of different feedback mechanisms. They also discovered a new regulatory element that was not previously known. They used a combination of mathematical modeling and experimental work to understand how these sub-networks and regulatory elements interacted to form the overall quorum sensing system. The researchers were able to identify the genes and proteins that were important for the proper functioning of the quorum sensing system and revealed the basis for the genetic “switch” in E. coli QS circuitry. The results of this study will help to unravel complex regulatory networks in bacteria and lead to the development of new strategies for controlling bacterial behavior in different environments.
This article describes a study on the relationship between malaria and schistosomiasis in school-aged children in the Lambaréné area of Gabon. The study was conducted over two years and involved 498 school-age children. At the start of the study, researchers found that 30% of children were infected with P. falciparum, 23% were infected with S. haematobium, and 9% were co-infected with both parasites. The study found that children with schistosomiasis had a higher risk of malaria infection. In addition, the study found that children with higher infection loads of hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, or Trichuris trichiura had an increased risk of malaria infection. These findings suggest that controlling infections with hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, or Trichuris trichiura may help reduce the incidence of malaria in school-age children in the Lambaréné area.
Inflammation plays a key role in promoting , sustaining , and tuning the response of CD8+ T cells to infection. In a mouse model of leishmaniasis, the inflammatory response is mainly induced by the transcription factor IRF-5 . IRF-5 is responsible for activating several genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF . We found that the inflammatory response induced by IRF-5 limits CD8+ T cell expansion at the very early stages of infection by indirectly inducing HIF-1α expression in DCs. Upregulation of HIF-1α in DCs resulted in decreased IL-12 and increased IL-10 expression, which in turn led to a higher frequency of short-lived effector CD8+ T cells (SLECs) , enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion , and significantly reduced parasite burden . In a mouse model of OT-I/RAG1-deficient CD8+ T cells, we found that IRF-5-mediated inflammation regulates CD8+ T cell expansion following infection with Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis. Our findings suggest that IRF-5-mediated inflammation may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis.
This article is about a systematic review of studies that have investigated prognostic factors for American visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a serious disease that affects humans and dogs. The review focused on factors that could predict the development of adverse outcomes in VL patients, including death, severe disease, and development of symptoms. The authors searched for relevant studies in various databases and assessed the quality of the research. They identified several prognostic factors associated with adverse outcomes in VL patients, such as jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age under 5 or over 40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. The authors highlighted the importance of validating these prognostic factors in future research to improve the management and treatment of VL patients.
This article presents the first study on the susceptibility of Leishmania parasites to antimony drugs in Algeria. The study includes 106 Leishmania isolates collected from humans, dogs, sandflies, and rodents over a 30-year period. The isolates were identified and characterized according to their species, zymodeme, clinic, and geographical origin. The susceptibility of the Leishmania parasites to antimony drugs was determined by flow cytometry. The results of this study indicate that the sensitivity of Leishmania parasites to antimony drugs varied according to species, zymodeme, clinic, geographical origin, and drug type. The results highlight the emergence of Sb(V)-resistant L. killicki (syn L. tropica) parasites in Algeria and their association with the emergence of cutaneous leishmaniosis in certain regions of the country. The study also provides important information on the distribution of Leishmania species in Algeria and their association with the various clinical forms of leishmaniosis. This information is essential for the development of effective strategies for the control and prevention of leishmaniosis in Algeria.
This study used mouse models to investigate the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and acute infectious gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella and Citrobacter bacteria. The study found that gastroenteritis causes an increase in the levels of adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), a bacterial pathobiont linked to IBD, in the intestines of mice. This increase in AIEC levels is associated with increased inflammation, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. The study also found that AIEC is sensitive to host defense peptides and that a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen is required for the observed increase in AIEC levels. These findings suggest that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for IBD onset. The study also identifies AIEC as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals.
In this study, the authors have used an egg cell-specific marker to study the regulation of gametic cell fate in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis thaliana. They have identified a mutant, lis-1, which is defective in the differentiation of gametic and accessory cell fates. They have found that lis-1 is a loss-of-function mutation in the At2g41500 locus, which encodes a protein with seven WD40 repeats. The LIS protein is strongly conserved among eukaryotes and has been shown to be involved in splicing. The authors have shown that LIS is involved in a lateral inhibition mechanism that prevents excess gametic cell formation by maintaining the differentiation of gametic and accessory cell fates. They have also found that the LIS protein is expressed at moderate levels in all tissues examined, with strongest expression in reproductive tissues. The authors have provided a detailed description of the function and expression of the LIS protein, and have provided evidence for its role in the regulation of gametic cell fate.
The role of footwear in protecting against diseases that affect people's feet is becoming increasingly important in medical research. In a rural Ethiopian community that is endemic for a disease called podoconiosis, which is caused by exposure to irritant soils, shoes were found to be becoming more common. However, there are many social and practical barriers that prevent people from wearing shoes consistently, including limited financial resources, fear of stigma, and difficulty finding appropriate shoe sizes. These barriers may also be relevant to other neglected tropical diseases that affect people's feet, such as hookworm and snakebite. To understand these barriers, researchers used a well-established model called the PRECEDE-PROCEED model. This model helps identify social, behavioral, environmental, educational and ecological needs that may influence whether and when children wear shoes. Researchers also drew on social cognitive theory, which suggests that individual beliefs and attitudes about shoe wearing, as well as their perceived capabilities to prevent the disease, can affect their behavior. By understanding these factors, researchers can develop more effective interventions to promote shoe wearing as a means of preventing podoconiosis and other diseases.
In this study, we analyzed the role of the Us9 protein in PRV-162, a mutant of PRV-99 that is deficient in anterograde transport of viral particles from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We found that Us9 is not necessary for anterograde transport in PRV-162, but is required for intracellular viral sorting and is responsible for PRV-162's aberrant sorting phenotype. We also identified the Us9-TfR interaction as the primary sorting determinant for PRV-162. Our findings provide new insights into the PRV-162 infection mechanism and the role of Us9 in PRV-162 sorting.
This article presents a new approach for measuring yeast cell-to-cell variation in the speed of growth using fluorescence microscopy. The authors describe a new algorithm called PIE that can detect microcolony growth edges by measuring the intensity of a fluorescent protein in each cell. The PIE algorithm is designed to work with fluorescence signals that are highly variable across cells and over time, making it well-suited for measuring the growth rates of yeast colonies. The authors also describe a new approach for quantifying the intracellular concentration of cAMP in yeast cells using fluorescence microscopy. They show that this approach can accurately measure the cAMP concentration in individual yeast cells and can be used to measure the effects of cAMP on cell growth and division. The authors also demonstrate how their new approaches can be used to investigate the role of the cAMP-dependent kinase Msn2 in regulating yeast cell growth and division in response to changes in the extracellular environment. Overall, this article provides a valuable resource for researchers who are interested in using fluorescence microscopy to study cellular processes in yeast.
Scientists have found that the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) strain that has arrived in the Americas from the Asian lineage is a rapidly evolving virus. They used deep-sequencing technologies and bioinformatics pipelines to analyze the viral genetic diversity present in human blood samples and found that there were many different variants at various levels in the population. The scientists also identified a new 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure that may have been missed by the initial sequencing performed on the ongoing epidemic in the Americas. These findings highlight the need to continue viral diversity surveillance over time as this epidemic evolves.
This article presents a study on the regulation of cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling by a previously unannotated gene named Ubtor. The authors first identified Ubtor as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling through reductions of Ubtor expression levels in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells that promote neurite outgrowth. They also found that UBTOR depletion promotes cell growth in HEK293T and U87MG cells, while UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in HEK293T and T24 cells. The authors further showed that reduction of Ubtor promotes mTOR signaling in cultured cells and zebrafish. Mechanistic studies in cultured cells showed that UBTOR interacts with DEPTOR and mTOR complexes, and further studies showed that UBTOR stabilizes DEPTOR and regulates DEPTOR’s ubiquitination. Lastly, the authors demonstrated that ubtor gene disruption in zebrafish increases mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS (G12V) induced neoplasia in the intact animals. The authors also showed that Ubtor depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in xenograft-bearing mice.
In this study, we used liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify and quantify the proteins expressed in Trypanosoma brucei, a parasitic protozoan that causes African sleeping sickness. We identified 2,789 proteins, including 2,105 that were not previously characterized. We also identified 542 proteins that were highly abundant in the parasite. Our results provide a comprehensive overview of the proteome of T. brucei and suggest that the parasite has a large number of hypothetical proteins with unknown functions. Our study also suggests that many hypothetical proteins may be involved in cellular processes, such as transcription and translation, that are important for parasite survival and proliferation.
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, affecting millions of people worldwide. TB primarily affects the lungs, but can also affect other organs in the body, including lymph nodes. In this study, we examined the role of lymph nodes in TB infection and disease progression. We used a non-human primate (macaque) model of TB to study the dynamics of infection in lymph nodes over time. We found that lymph nodes become infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the causative agent of TB) early after infection, and that they grow in size and contain more bacteria as the infection progresses. We also found that some lymph nodes develop granulomas, which are characteristic of TB infection, while others do not. Our findings suggest that lymph nodes are an important site of infection and disease progression in TB, and that they may play a role in the development of drug-resistant strains of the bacteria. Further studies of the role of lymph nodes in TB infection and disease progression are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease and to develop more effective treatments.
Microsporidia are fungal parasites that infect various animals, including nematodes. In this study, the authors identified and characterized 47 new microsporidian species infecting 43 different rhabditid nematode species, including 28 Caenorhabditis elegans strains. They used molecular methods to identify and classify these species and obtained 20 microsporidian spore preparations to infect other nematodes. The study provides valuable insights into the diversity and evolution of microsporidian parasites and their hosts.
The article provides an overview of the function and assembly of chemokine receptors, which are important for the inflammatory response and HIV infection. The authors discuss the role of cholesterol in modulating receptor dimerization and present new structural information about homo- and heterodimers of the receptors.
In this article, the authors describe a new form of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease that is spread by sand flies and can cause fever, weight loss, and spleen and liver enlargement. This new form is referred to as "atypical" because it has symptoms that differ from the classical form of the disease. The authors discovered this form by examining the immune systems of patients who were suspected to be immune-deficient and who had unexplained low levels of certain immune cells. They used several specialized tests, such as microscopic examinations and cultures of biopsies, to determine the cause of the immune deficiency. They found that many of these patients had parasites inside their macrophages, a type of immune cell that is responsible for fighting off infections. The authors believe that this new form of leishmaniasis may be more common than previously thought and that it may present with a wider range of symptoms. They recommend that doctors consider the possibility of atypical leishmaniasis in patients with unexplained immune deficiencies.
The study aimed to investigate the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences. To do so, the researchers compiled a collection of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and the Human Genome Mutation Database ( HGMD ) and used them to identify and characterize pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins. The analyses demonstrate that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins. Moreover, if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. Thus, information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
The authors present a comparative analysis of gene expression in parasites causing severe and uncomplicated malaria. They used RNA sequencing to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients. They found that severe malaria was associated with decreased glycolysis and altered chromatin structure, transcriptional regulation, and surface expression of PfEMP1. They also identified novel associations between severe malaria and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments. Their findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to the host environment in severe malaria.
In this study, the authors describe the delivery of broadly neutralizing anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) via intramuscular injections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. The mAbs were derived from antibodies isolated from SIV-infected rhesus monkeys and were engineered to contain only authentic rhesus IgG1 sequences. AAV vector was designed to deliver the mAbs in the IgG1 form, which is more stable and has a longer half-life than the IgG3 form. The authors show that the AAV-delivered mAbs were able to persist in the bloodstream of rhesus monkeys for up to 14 weeks after delivery. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the mAbs were able to provide protection against a challenging virus, SIVmac239, in six of the six animals. The results of this study show the promise of using AAV vector to deliver broadly neutralizing mAbs to provide protection against SIV infection.
Protein molecules can undergo conformational relaxation motions in response to energy supply or external stimuli. In this study, researchers used numerical investigations to analyze the conformational relaxation properties of two important protein motors - myosin V and kinesin KIF1A - within the coarse-grained elastic network approximation. They found that the linearity assumption often used in the theory of protein dynamics is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations. The results show that the normal mode description is not applicable to these motor proteins and the nonlinear effects dominate functional mechanochemical motions in kinesin KIF1A. Despite the nonlinearity, well-defined conformational relaxation paths that are robust against perturbations have been found in both motor proteins. The researchers concluded that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered.
In this study, we investigate the crosstalk between CLIC/GEEC endocytosis and caveolae. We found that caveolae are important for CLIC/GEEC endocytosis and that CAV1, a protein required for caveolae formation, negatively regulates CLIC/GEEC endocytosis. These results indicate that the two membrane systems share several similarities and have unique properties in migrating cells.
In this study, the authors present a lay summary of their research on the Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domain subclass of two-component signaling (TCS) proteins. TCS proteins are responsible for sensing and responding to environmental stimuli, such as the presence of toxins or changes in nutrient availability, to help bacteria adapt and survive. The ALR domain is a divergent subclass of TCS proteins that lacks the phosphorylatable Asp residue that is common to most TCS proteins. Despite this lack of conservation, the ALR domain is functionally and structurally related to TCS proteins. The authors describe the prevalence of ALR domains in bacteria and show that they can take on a variety of different functions, such as binding DNA or small molecules and modulating cellular processes. They also provide a lay summary of the structural and biochemical analyses of the ALR domain in the context of a specific example, the ALR domain from RitR, a protein involved in iron and oxidative stress regulation in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, this study provides a lay summary of the ALR domain subclass of TCS proteins, including its prevalence, functions, and structural and biochemical features.
Herpesvirus (HSV) infections are a major health issue worldwide and have a significant impact on the human population. HSVs are divided into two distinct types: herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2). While HSV-1 primarily causes oral infections, HSV-2 predominantly causes genital infections. HSV-1 and HSV-2 have both been associated with the development of several types of cancers, including cervical cancer. Researchers have developed oncolytic viruses that specifically target HSV receptors on the surface of cancer cells and kill them. These viruses have shown promising results in treating various types of cancer, including cervical cancer. Oncolytic HSVs (oHSVs) can be genetically engineered to express antitumor proteins or to target specific cancer cells. While oHSVs have shown promise, some limitations must be overcome before they can be used for cancer therapy. First, they are often not as specific to cancer cells as desired and can cause damage to healthy tissues. Second, they can be attenuated or even non-replicative, leading to reduced efficacy. Third, they can trigger the immune system to clear the infection, which can limit their effectiveness. Despite these limitations, oHSVs are still an active area of research and hold great promise for the development of effective cancer therapies.
HIV vaccines are designed to stimulate the immune system to fight HIV infection. Two common types of HIV vaccines are based on recombinant viral vectors, such as adenovirus 5 (Ad5) and canarypox virus (ALVAC). Both vectors have been tested in clinical trials, but they have shown different levels of safety and efficacy. Researchers have found that CD4 T cells, which are central to the immune system's response to HIV infection, are highly susceptible to HIV infection when they are activated and expanded in response to Ad5-based vaccines. However, ALVAC-based vaccines induce CD4 T cells that are less susceptible to HIV infection. This finding highlights the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.
The article explains the evolutionary processes that lead to different X inactivation strategies in mammals. X inactivation is the process in which one of the two copies of the X chromosome is turned off in female cells to balance the number of X chromosomes between males and females. The article suggests that the evolution of random X inactivation ( RXI ) in placental mammals is favored when segregating deleterious mutations have partially recessive fitness effects. It also suggests that sex-differential selection might favor the evolution of biased X inactivation patterns ( unequal expression of maternally and paternally derived X chromosomes ).
In this paper, the authors explore the antiviral activity of the CCCH-type zinc-finger protein, ZAP, against several flaviviruses, including Zika virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and Dengue virus. They found that ZAP can inhibit the replication of these viruses in different cell lines, including human neuroblastoma cells, human astrocytes, and human neuronal progenitor cells. The authors also demonstrate that ZAP has specific antiviral activity against Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, which is not observed for Dengue virus. Furthermore, they show that ZAP can inhibit the translation of viral proteins in infected cells, suggesting that ZAP may exert its antiviral activity by interfering with the viral translation machinery. Overall, the findings of this study provide important insights into the antiviral activity of ZAP against several flaviviruses and highlight the potential of ZAP as a therapeutic target for the treatment of flavivirus infections.
Rift Valley fever virus ( RVFV ) is a major human and animal pathogen that can cause severe disease including hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis. RVFV is endemic to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but there is significant concern regarding its introduction into non-endemic regions and the potentially devastating effect to livestock populations. To date, little detailed data directly comparing the host response to infection with wild-type or vaccine strains of RVFV and correlation with viral pathogenesis has been available. Here, the authors characterized clinical and systemic immune responses to infection with wild-type strain ZH501 or IND vaccine strain MP-12 in the C57BL/6 mouse. Animals infected with live-attenuated MP-12 survived productive viral infection with little evidence of clinical disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues. In contrast, ZH501 infection was lethal, caused depletion of lymphocytes and platelets and elicited a strong systemic cytokine response which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology. Lymphopenia and platelet depletion were indicators of disease onset with indications of lymphocyte recovery correlating with increases in G-CSF production. RVFV is hepatotropic and in these studies significant clinical and histological data supported these findings, however significant evidence of a pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent. Rather, viral infection resulted in a chemokine response indicating infiltration of immunoreactive cells, such as neutrophils, which was supported by histological data. In brains of ZH501 infected mice, a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, but with little pathology indicating meningoencephalitis. These data suggest that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with a loss of liver function due to liver necrosis and hepatitis yet the long-term course of disease for those that might survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature which is supported by observations of human disease and the BALB/c mouse model.
Chemotherapy for breast cancer is a vital but often ineffective treatment. We have found that CCL20 plays a key role in taxane resistance and chemotherapy failure. Our study suggests that CCL20 may be a potential biomarker for taxane resistance and a target for chemotherapy.
In this study, the authors characterize the effects of a novel protein-protein complex in Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis in humans and animals. The complex, which involves two parasite-specific proteins, MYR2 and MYR3, is important for the parasite's ability to replicate inside host cells. The authors found that MYR2 and MYR3 are present in the parasite's dense granules, which are organelles that play an important role in Toxoplasma's ability to survive and replicate inside host cells. The authors also found that MYR2 and MYR3 form a stable complex that is required for the proper localization of other dense granule proteins. Additionally, the authors found that MYR3 is phosphorylated by a protein kinase that is part of the dense granule complex. The phosphorylation of MYR3 is important for the proper localization of dense granule proteins and for the parasite's ability to replicate inside host cells. Overall, the study provides important insights into the function of the dense granule complex in Toxoplasma and suggests that MYR2 and MYR3 are key components of this complex.
This article provides information on the origin recognition complex (ORC) and its role in the initiation of replication in the human papillomavirus (HPV). The ORC binds to specific DNA sequences known as origins of replication, and once bound, recruits other replication proteins to the site. The article describes how the ORC has been studied in various organisms and how it is thought to function in HPV. The article also discusses how the ORC has been targeted in cancer therapy, particularly in HPV-associated cancers.
This study investigated the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban areas of Dushanbe, Tajikistan using qPCR targeting the IS711 insertion element. The study found that 10.3% of the 570 milk samples were positive for Brucella DNA. The rpoB gene was used to sequence the DNA and determine the species of Brucella present in the samples. The results showed that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B. melitensis. The study highlights the need for further investigation to determine the best strategy for controlling Brucella infections in livestock in urban and peri-urban areas.
The paper describes the construction and characterization of KMT1 and KMT6 deletion mutants in the fungal plant pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. The chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data obtained for KMT1 and KMT6 show a high degree of overlap with each other, suggesting that they bind to similar genomic regions. The genes that are bound by KMT1 and KMT6 are highly repressed and transcriptionally silent, and the mutants exhibit a number of phenotypes, including reduced growth, increased cell size, and altered cell wall composition. The paper also reports the construction of a KMT1/KMT6 double mutant, which exhibits a phenotype that is more severe than the single mutants. The data presented in this paper contribute to our understanding of the roles of KMT1 and KMT6 in the epigenetic regulation of Z. tritici, and provide a foundation for future studies to elucidate their functions in this important plant pathogen.
Prompt post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) is an essential treatment for preventing the onset of rabies, a fatal disease that affects millions of people worldwide. However, access to life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals is limited, particularly to the poorest sectors of society who are most at risk and bear the largest burden of rabies. Switching from intramuscular ( IM ) administration of PEP to equally effective intradermal ( ID ) regimens could mitigate vaccine shortages, significantly reduce costs, and improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims. A universal switch to ID delivery would benefit both bite victims and healthcare providers by improving the affordability and accessibility of PEP, potentially reducing human rabies deaths, and being economical for healthcare providers.
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects all mammals and birds. During infection, Toxoplasma interacts with host cells to obtain nutrients and replicate efficiently. The authors show that Toxoplasma parasites acquire host lipids, including triacylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositol, via a process that involves lipophagy of the host endoplasmic reticulum, and that the parasite's ability to do so is dependent on the presence of lipid droplets in the host cell. The authors also show that Toxoplasma infection results in an increase in host lipid droplets, which are associated with an increase in parasite replication. The authors suggest that the presence of host lipid droplets may be important for Toxoplasma to acquire host lipids efficiently, and that this process may be important for parasite replication. Overall, the results provide important insights into the mechanisms by which Toxoplasma gondii interacts with host cells during infection.
The article describes the screening of flavonoid chalcones as novel inhibitors of the fasciolicide enzyme FhCL1. The authors used in vitro assays to test the chalcones for inhibition and obtained promising results with the compound C34. The article also provides information on the molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations used to predict the binding mechanism of the inhibitor.
In the retina, neurons called bipolar cells transmit visual signals to other neurons. These bipolar cells have multiple terminals that transmit the visual signal in different ways. In this study, researchers used a special imaging technique to observe the activity of multiple bipolar cell terminals in living zebrafish retinas. They found that different sized terminals behave differently, generating faster or slower calcium signals and transmitting visual signals with different adaptive properties. The study suggests that the different sizes of bipolar cell terminals may allow for the transmission of visual signals with a range of different temporal filters.
The paper describes an unsupervised probabilistic method for synapse detection and analysis that uses fluorescence microscopy (FM) images. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the biological knowledge of synapse characteristics, and it uses query-based probabilistic synapse detection. It first distinguishes signal from background noise, then determines whether the foreground pixels correspond to a 2D punctum, then evaluates the presence of adjacent presynaptic and postsynaptic puncta by correlating the corresponding IF volumes. The method provides a general framework for the evaluation of a wide variety of synapse subtypes, user-defined by setting the presynaptic and postsynaptic antibodies and puncta size. The algorithm is compared with a supervised method in a real-world dataset, and it is shown to outperform the supervised method in the cases where both methods can be used.
ZnT2 is a zinc transporter that functions in the intracellular vesicular compartment. Previously, the driving force for ZnT2-mediated zinc transport was found to be a proton gradient across the membrane. However, the stoichiometry of ZnT2 was unknown. In this study, the authors used computational modeling to predict the proton-coupled zinc transport mechanism of ZnT2 and experimentally validated it using a fluorescent zinc indicator. They found that ZnT2 transports two protons for every zinc ion, which supports a proton-coupled zinc transport mechanism. The authors also showed that BafA1, an inhibitor of the V-ATPase proton pump, abolished ZnT2-mediated zinc transport. These findings provide important insights into the mechanism of ZnT2-mediated zinc transport and its regulation.
We have shown that yeast 14-3-3 proteins regulate the activity of the replication fork-associated nuclease Exo1. We have demonstrated that 14-3-3 proteins are required to maintain Exo1 phosphorylation and activity during replication fork arrest and that a loss of 14-3-3 proteins results in replication fork collapse and DNA damage. We have also shown that 14-3-3 proteins regulate the progression of stalled replication forks during DNA replication stress. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of Exo1 and the maintenance of replication fork stability during DNA replication stress.
HIV-1 infection is a global pandemic that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite significant advances in the understanding and treatment of HIV-1 infection, it remains a major public health concern. The role of pDC in HIV-1 infection is not well defined. HIV-1 infection in the humanized mouse model leads to persistent HIV-1 infection and immunopathogenesis. We developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice. When pDC were depleted prior to HIV-1 infection, the induction of IFN-I and ISGs were abolished during acute HIV-1 infection. Consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. Interestingly, the cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was severely reduced in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1 induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs, but not the blood, was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication. The increased cell number in lymphoid organs was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells. We conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis. These findings suggest that pDC-depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retroviral treatment.
In this study, the authors investigated the impact of sulforaphane (SFN), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, on the infection of macrophages and T cells by HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively. They found that SFN blocks HIV-1 infection in macrophages but not in T cells, suggesting that macrophages may be an important target for SFN-mediated protection against HIV infection. They also found that SFN blocks HIV infection after entry into the cell but before reverse transcription, and that it does not affect the levels of Nrf2, a transcription factor that has been shown to increase resistance to some viruses. These results suggest that SFN may be useful as a therapeutic agent to prevent or slow the progression of HIV infection.
This study was conducted in rural Kenya to learn more about geohelminth infections among pregnant women. Geohelminths are parasites that can cause intestinal bleeding and protein loss, especially in hookworm infections. The study found that 76.2% of pregnant women in the area had at least one geohelminth infection, with hookworm being the most common. The study also found that geohelminth infections were not associated with low body mass index or malaria parasitemia. However, hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid upper arm circumference and a lower hemoglobin level. In addition, Ascaris lumbricoides infections were associated with impaired fat digestion and reduced vitamin absorption, and Trichuris trichiura infections were associated with a lower hemoglobin level. This study found that geohelminth infections are common among pregnant women in rural Kenya, and there may be different effects of geohelminths on pregnant women depending on the type of geohelminth infection. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of geohelminth infections on pregnant women and to determine the best ways to prevent and treat these infections.
This paper investigates the immunomodulatory and cytotoxic effects of mycolactone, a product of the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, on various cells of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Mycolactone affects the Sec61-dependent translation of cytokines, leading to a reduction in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α and CCL2. Mycolactone also exhibited a significant cytotoxic effect on various immune cells, including microglia, astrocytes and neurons. The authors also studied the effects of mycolactone on the neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain in rats. They found that mycolactone reduced neuroinflammation in rats by reducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and by reducing the proliferation of microglia. The authors suggest that mycolactone could be a useful drug for the treatment of pain.
The study investigates the genetic basis of human immunity to African sleeping sickness (HAT) caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense in West Africa. The researchers tested for associations between candidate gene polymorphisms and HAT outcome in populations from HAT active foci in Guinea. The study found that IL6 rs1818879 allele A was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease. MIF rs36086171 allele G seemed to be associated with an increased risk, but this association did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. Similarly, MIF rs12483859 C allele seemed be associated with latent infections. APOL1 G2 allele ( DEL ) was associated with a higher risk, while APOL1 G1 polymorphism was with a lower risk of developing HAT. No associations were found with other candidate genes. The study provides valuable information on the genetic determinants of HAT outcomes and contributes to our understanding of host-parasite interactions. This knowledge may help in the development of new control tools to combat this deadly disease.
The study reports the genomic characterization of 38 healthy Indian subjects from Singapore. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on these individuals at a depth of 30X and a total of 36,735,111 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 5,380,125 insertion-deletions (indels), and 20,477 structural variants (SVs) were identified. The genetic diversity of the Singapore Indians was found to be comparable to that of the Indian population in the United Kingdom. The study also provides insights into the genetic relatedness of the Singapore Indians with other South Asian populations.
The article by Barry and colleagues is a detailed analysis of the aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms in strains of Burkholderia pseudomallei. The authors used qRT-PCR, transcript analysis, mutant construction, and whole genome sequencing to examine the amrAB-oprA efflux pump. The authors found that the 2188a and 3799a strains have amrAB-oprA deletions, leading to aminoglycoside and macrolide resistance. The deletion in 2188a also removed other genes involved in malleobactin and cobalamin synthesis and anaerobic arginine deiminase metabolism. The authors demonstrate the virulence of the strain with the amrAB-oprA deletion in a murine melioidosis model. The authors also discuss the potential use of 708a for genetic manipulation experiments using Select Agent compliant antibiotics. Overall, the article provides important insights into the mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance in B. pseudomallei and its virulence.
In this paper, the authors explored the differentiation of CD4 T helper cells into Th1 or Th2 cells by counting single transcripts and measuring immunofluorescence in individual cells. They found that transcription factors, which are usually expressed exclusively in the pertinent cell type, are actually co-expressed in individual cells in low levels that are distinct from basal levels during lineage priming. They also observed that cytokines are expressed in a small subpopulation of cells and independently of the expression of transcription factors in these single cells. The cell-to-cell variation in cytokine expression during the early phase of T helper cell differentiation is significantly larger than in the fully differentiated state. Upon inhibition of cytokine signaling, the authors observed the mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors, revealing a weak intracellular network that is usually overruled by strong signals that emanate from extracellular cytokines. These findings suggest that during the early differentiation process CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state, which is instructed by extracellular cytokines. The interplay between extracellular and intracellular signaling components unveiled in Th1/Th2 differentiation may be a common strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.
The study by Belcher et al. 2015 aimed to identify genes that interact with the C . elegans PAQR-2 receptor, which is important for cold-adaptation. The authors used an unbiased forward genetic approach to isolate nine paqr-2 suppressors that are able to rescue the cold-adaptation defect of the paqr-2 mutant. They then characterized the genes affected by the mutations in these suppressors and found that they are involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. The authors propose a novel regulatory pathway connecting PAQR-2, phosphatidylcholine synthesis, and the regulation of fatty acid desaturation to increase membrane fluidity during cold adaptation.
This article describes the discovery of a new feature within the tegument layer of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) that may play a role in genome release into the nucleus. The authors used cryo-electron tomography to reveal this feature, which is located at the portal vertex of the HSV-1 capsid. This feature is not visible in the tegument layer of the HSV-1 virion when observed in isolation, but it becomes apparent when the virus particle is viewed as part of a larger structure. The authors speculate that this new structure may be involved in the docking of the virus to the nuclear pore complex, which is required for the release of the viral genome into the nucleus of a host cell.
The study "Abstract: Parasite-induced modulation of DC and HIV-1 infection" is a research article that investigates the effects of a protein called soluble egg antigen (SEA) on human immune cells called dendritic cells (DCs) and their ability to be infected with HIV-1. The authors found that SEA can modulate the ability of DCs to be infected with HIV-1 and can also affect the phenotype and function of immune cells. This study has implications for the role of parasites in modulating the immune system and the potential for parasite-derived proteins to be used as therapeutic agents for HIV-1.
In this study, the authors provide a mathematical model to describe the process of astrocyte swelling, a phenomenon that occurs during periods of intense neuronal activity in the brain. Using this model, the authors explore the role of different ion transport mechanisms in the swelling process and investigate the impact of genetic modifications on these mechanisms. The authors conclude that the NKCC1 cotransporter plays a key role in the swelling process, and that genetic modifications that affect this transporter can have significant effects on the swelling phenotype. Overall, the study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying astrocyte swelling and highlights the potential for genetic modifications to be used to modulate this process.
Eukaryotic genomes contain a lot of repetitive DNA that can be harmful if it is transcribed, so it is usually turned off. To do this, plants use a process called RNA interference (RNAi) that makes small pieces of RNA that can tell the plant to turn off certain genes. In this study, the researchers found out that one of the proteins involved in RNAi, called SPT5L, can bind to DNA. They also found that SPT5L and another protein called AGO4, which is also involved in RNAi, can bind to DNA at the same time, but they do it in a different way. They also showed that both of these proteins are needed for the plant to turn off certain genes that contain repeating DNA.
This article describes the importance of rpoS, a sigma factor gene, in the B. burgdorferi (Bb) bacterium that causes Lyme disease in humans and animals. The authors show that the RpoS protein is important for spirochete survival in the tick midgut, a key stage in the Bb life cycle. They also show that the rpoS gene is important for Bb to transform from a round to a spiral shape, which is necessary for spirochete motility and survival in the bloodstream of a mammalian host. The authors provide evidence that the RpoS protein is involved in the metabolism of coenzyme A (CoA), which is necessary for NADH production, and that the RpoS protein is important for the survival of Bb in the midgut of ticks. Overall, this article provides important insights into the role of the RpoS protein in the Bb life cycle and its importance for Bb survival in the tick midgut.
The article by Xu et al. describes a hierarchical relationship between the plant hormones gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) in controlling the development of stamen filaments in Arabidopsis. The authors discovered a group of three stamen-enriched genes (MYB21, MYB24 and MYB57) that are downregulated by GA in the DELLA-overexpressing mutant Q3, but not in the DELLA-deficient mutant penta. They also found that JA is upregulated by GA in Q3, but not in penta. Moreover, the authors showed that exogenous JA, but not GA, can restore the expression of MYB21, MYB24 and MYB57 in Q3, and that the expression of these genes is not restored by exogenous GA in opr3 mutant. Finally, they demonstrated that application of exogenous JA can rescue the short stamen phenotype conferred by loss of function of MYB21 and MYB24 in double mutants, but not by exogenous GA. Together, these results suggest that GA acts upstream of JA to regulate stamen development via a hierarchical relationship.
In this article, the authors explore the role of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in the lifespan extension of Caenorhabditis elegans under dietary restriction (DR). They found that HIF-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan, which is similar to the lifespan extension observed in rsks-1/S6 kinase mutants. They also showed that the extended lifespan in HIF-1 and rsks-1/S6 kinase mutants is tissue-specific and involves the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. Overall, their findings suggest that HIF-1 and the TOR pathway play distinct roles in the lifespan extension of C. elegans under DR.
The article describes the discovery of unique enhancer regions and their role in cell differentiation and migration. It compares enhancer regions in cells that are differentiating, migrating, and not undergoing any change. It also examines the role of a transcription factor called GRHL3 in differentiation and migration and how it affects enhancer regions. The article discusses how the results of this study could help with the treatment of skin diseases. The language is scientific and uses technical terms related to genetics and biology.
This study characterizes the evolutionary history and molecular virology of endogenous retroviruses (enJSRVs) in sheep. These viruses are of the Betaretrovirus genus, which also includes the exogenous retroviruses that cause sheep respiratory tract tumors. The study reveals that two enJSRV loci entered the sheep genome before and during speciation within the genus Ovis. These loci later acquired the tryptophan-to-arginine mutation in the Gag protein, which confers a transdominant blocking phenotype. The transdominant enJSRVs became fixed in the sheep genome before or around sheep domestication. The study also provides evidence for the continuous invasion of the sheep genome by ERVs of the JSRV/enJSRVs group, as well as the emergence of proviruses that can escape the transdominant enJSRVs. These findings have important implications for understanding the coevolution of retroviruses and their hosts, and may also have implications for the development of new therapies for retrovirus-induced diseases.
The study aimed to evaluate the performance of two in-house real-time PCRs, targeting Schistosoma mansoni (Sm) and Schistosoma haematobium (Sh), in stool, urine, and biopsy samples, as well as serum, in diagnosing active schistosomiasis infections and monitoring treatment efficacy. Schistosoma PCRs were performed on 412 samples from patients with suspected schistosomiasis before anti-parasitic treatment. Results were compared to microscopic examination and serological assays (ELISA, HA, and WB). The SmPCR increased the sensitivity of diagnosing Sh in urine and Sm in stools from 4% to 10.5% and from 33.7% to 48.8%, respectively. The overall sensitivity of SmPCR on serum samples was 72.7% and reached 94.1% in patients with positive excreta (microscopy). The SmPCR specificity was 98.9%. After treatment, SmPCR positivity rates slowly declined from 93.8% at day 30 to 8.3% at day 360, whereas antibody detection remained positive after 1 year. The ShPCR also significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosing Sh in urine from 33.7% to 48.8%, and its overall sensitivity on serum samples was 72.7%. The specificity of the ShPCR was 98.9%. After treatment, ShPCR positivity rates declined from 94.1% at day 30 to 11.1% at day 360, whereas antibody detection remained positive after 1 year. When serological assays are positive and microscopy is negative, serum PCRs provide species information to guide further clinical exploration. Biomarkers such as DNA and antibodies are of limited relevance for early treatment monitoring, but serum PCR could be useful when performed at least 1 year after treatment to help confirm a cured infection. The authors concluded that Schistosoma PCRs could be useful in diagnosing schistosomiasis infections, particularly in non-endemic countries where parasite burden can be lower, and for monitoring treatment efficacy. They also emphasized that further research is needed to develop a standardized protocol for the use of molecular methods in diagnosing schistosomiasis.
Archazolid A is a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase that was discovered by Menche and coworkers. Its chemical structure is complex, with seven alkenes, eight methyl- and hydroxyl-bearing stereocenters, and three in-solution model conformations. We built a model using Gaussian process regression that can predict the energies of relaxed conformations at the density functional level of theory (implicit solvent, DFT/BLYP-disp3/def2-TZVP) with mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol. Our model has the potential to speed up molecular dynamics simulations of larger molecular structures, allowing for faster exploration of the chemical space.
Ebola virus (EBOV) infections have been previously described in western lowland gorillas (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) in Central Africa. The researchers report the successful non-invasive detection of antibodies against EBOV in gorilla feces. The detection of EBOV antibodies in gorilla feces allows for a better understanding of the prevalence of EBOV infections in gorillas. The researchers found that EBOV antibody prevalence reached 10% on average, demonstrating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was identified in gorillas thought previously to be unexposed to EBOV. This new approach will contribute to a strategy to protect apes from future EBOV infections by early detection of increased incidence of exposure, by identifying immunologically naïve at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and by providing a means to track vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate. Since human EVD is linked to contact with infected wildlife carcasses, efforts aimed at identifying great ape outbreaks could have a profound impact on public health in local communities, where EBOV causes case-fatality rates of up to 88%.
This manuscript describes the discovery of a novel ubiquitin ligase from Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv), a bacterium that causes spot diseases on many plant species. The authors found that the Xcv outer protein L (XopL) has an E3 ubiquitin ligase domain and that it can form ubiquitin chains in vitro with Arabidopsis UBC28 and A. thaliana E2s. They also found that XopL can induce cell death in N. benthamiana and A. thaliana protoplasts. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligases.
This article presents a study on the impact of early antiretroviral treatment (ART) on T helper cell-B cell responses in acute HIV infection. The study used the RV254 cohort, which included HIV-infected individuals recruited during the earliest stages of acute infection. The study found that impaired cTfh cell function was observed in individuals treated in stage 3 when compared to stage 1/2. The cTfh/B cell cocultures showed lower B cell survival and IgG secretion at stage 3 compared to stage 1/2. This coincided with lower IL-10 and increased RANTES and TNF-α, suggesting a role for inflammation in altering cTfh and B cell responses. The data suggest that early ART for acutely HIV infected individuals could preserve T and B cell memory responses against HIV infection.
In this study, we show that the Sm . 5HTRL isoform of the schistosome 5-hydroxytriptamine receptor is a novel and effective antiparasitic target. We performed an extensive characterization of Sm . 5HTRL, including agonist and antagonist screening, to identify new compounds with activity against this receptor. Our data provide insights into the pharmacology of Sm . 5HTRL and demonstrate its potential as a therapeutic target for schistosomiasis. We also provide a detailed description of the methods used to characterize this receptor, which may be useful for future studies of other flatworm GPCRs.
The authors of this study found that the boundary between ectoderm and mesoderm cells is maintained by EphrinB/EphB signaling. They found that EphB receptors and EphrinB ligands are expressed on both sides of the boundary, and that forward signaling across the boundary is involved in maintaining the separation between these cells. They also found that EphB/EphrinB signaling regulates the motility of mesoderm cells, which are in direct contact with the ectodermal blastocoel roof.
In this study, researchers analyzed metabolites of folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transsulfuration pathways in 83 participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers using Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) to classify the participants as on the spectrum or neurotypical. This analysis resulted in 96.1% of all neurotypical participants being correctly identified as such while still correctly identifying 97.7% of the ASD cohort. Furthermore, kernel partial least squares (KPLS) was used to predict adaptive behavior, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite score, where measurement of five metabolites of the pathways was sufficient to predict the Vineland score with an R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation. These results suggest that metabolites of these pathways are strongly correlated with an ASD diagnosis and may be used in the future to develop more accurate diagnoses and severity prediction.
The paper presents a Bayesian geostatistical model that predicts the incidence of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil, based on 10-year data. The model takes into account environmental and socioeconomic factors, as well as temporal trends, to provide accurate predictions at a high spatial resolution. The results show that climate, socioeconomic variables, and spatial effects are important predictors of the disease incidence, and that the predicted number of cases in 2010 was significantly higher than the reported number. The paper highlights the importance of accurate mapping of leishmaniasis incidence for targeting interventions and reducing disease incidence.
Dengue is a viral disease that affects millions of people worldwide, and the number of cases is increasing. As the disease spreads to new regions and the force of infection changes, a broader range of clinical presentations is being recognized. Researchers at a hospital in southern Vietnam compared the clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcome of 647 adults and 881 children with confirmed dengue. They found that adults experienced more severe thrombocytopenia, a condition in which there are low levels of platelets, than children. Additionally, adults had more bleeding manifestations and organ involvement, while children had more severe signs of vascular leakage and shock. The researchers suggest that there are clear distinctions between adults and children in the pattern of complications associated with dengue infection, and these differences depend partly on intrinsic age-dependent physiological differences. They encourage the development of management guidelines appropriate to the age-groups at risk and emphasize the importance of research on disease pathogenesis.
We identified a new mutation in the CCR5 gene of sooty mangabeys (SM) that results in a lack of surface expression and function of the coreceptor, despite the fact that the SM CCR5 gene is otherwise highly conserved. This mutation, which we named CCR5Δ2, was found in 8% of SM, and together with another mutation, CCR5Δ24, results in 13% of SM lacking functional CCR5. However, these animals are still susceptible to infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and show robust viral replication, suggesting that SIVsmm uses additional coreceptors. This is the first clear example of convergent evolution resulting in nonfunctional mutant CCR5 alleles among primate species.
This study investigates the tumorigenic potential of the transcriptional regulators MEF2 in leiomyosarcomas. The authors found that MEF2 can act as both transcriptional activators and repressors, depending on the cellular and genetic context. They also found that HDAC9, a member of the class IIa HDAC family, is required for MEF2-mediated transcriptional repression. The authors suggest that HDAC9 may be a target for therapeutic intervention in leiomyosarcomas.
The article describes the use of three different techniques, protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation and electron cryo-microscopy, to study the structure of films composed of two class II hydrophobins, HFBI and HFBII, produced by Trichoderma reesei. The study revealed a unit cell composed of six proteins, but the computational results suggest P6 symmetry while the experimental results show P3 symmetry with a unit cell size of 56 Å. The study also indicates the possibility of an alternate ordering with a three protein unit cell with P3 symmetry and a smaller unit cell size. The alternate metastable structure may play a role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydrophobin films and may have a mechanism of more general significance to both biology and nanotechnology.
Aminoacyltransferases are important enzymes that play a key role in protein synthesis. They catalyze the transfer of a specific amino acid to the 3'-end of the corresponding transfer RNA (tRNA). These enzymes are essential for the survival of many organisms, and have been extensively studied in bacteria, plants, and fungi. Recently, it has been discovered that these enzymes are also present in Leishmania parasites. Leishmania parasites are the causative agents of leishmaniasis, a group of diseases that affect the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. In this study, the aminoacyltransferase from Leishmania donovani was cloned, expressed, and purified. The enzyme was found to be specific for the transfer of l-threonine to its cognate tRNA. The purified enzyme was used to study its aminoacylation activity and its kinetic parameters. The results showed that the enzyme was capable of catalyzing the aminoacylation reaction with high efficiency and specificity. The enzyme was also found to be stable and could be purified to homogeneity. The results of this study provide valuable information on the aminoacyltransferase from Leishmania donovani, which can be used for the development of new drugs against leishmaniasis.
RIG-I is a critical component of the innate immune response to RNA viruses. In this study, the authors identify specific RNA sequences in the HCV poly-U/UC tract that are recognized by RIG-I. They find that the poly-uridine core ( U-core ) within the HCV poly-U/UC tract is essential for recognition by RIG-I, and that long poly-uridine sequences ( >U17 ) with interspersed ribocytosines induce in vitro anti-HCV responses and hepatic innate immune responses in vivo. These findings suggest that RIG-I recognition of specific RNA sequences within the HCV poly-U/UC tract triggers an innate immune response to HCV infection.
In recent years, eosinophils have been shown to play important roles in host metabolism and tissue regeneration. These functions are relevant to worm infections, where eosinophils are prominent and parasites rely on the host for nutrients to support growth or reproduction. The study aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying the observation that eosinophils promote growth of Trichinella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle. The results suggest that IL-4 and eosinophils are necessary for normal larval growth, and that eosinophils from IL-4-competent mice are sufficient to support growth. The eosinophil-mediated effect operates in the absence of adaptive immunity. Following invasion by newborn larvae, host gene expression in skeletal muscle is compatible with a regenerative response and a shift in the source of energy in infected tissue. Redistribution of glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) and phosphorylation of Akt are observed in nurse cells, consistent with enhancement of glucose uptake and glycogen storage by larvae that is known to occur. The data support a mechanism in which eosinophils promote larval growth by an IL-4-dependent mechanism that limits local interferon-driven responses that otherwise alter nutrient metabolism in infected muscle. The findings document a novel interaction between parasite and host in which worms have evolved a strategy to co-opt an innate host cell response in a way that facilitates their growth.
This study used a combination of methods to analyze DNA replication kinetics in different human cell lines. The authors found that the majority of cell lines replicate their genomes at an apparent speed of 200 kb/min. However, they also identified a subset of cell lines that replicate their genomes at an apparent speed of less than 200 kb/min. These cell lines include HeLa, MCF-7, and 293T cells, which have previously been used for molecular biology studies. The authors suggest that these cells may have distinct replication properties that make them useful for studies of replication.
This paper investigates how our brains can efficiently recognize objects, such as recognizing a person's face despite changes in lighting conditions, and proposes a theory that our brains use to learn this ability. The theory is based on the idea that the brain focuses on slowly changing aspects of objects, rather than rapidly changing ones, when recognizing them. The authors present an algorithm that can implement this theory and apply it to a spiking model of a neuron. They show that a modified version of Hebbian learning can be used to learn the slowest (in terms of SFA) combination of inputs in a spiking model neuron. Additionally, they show that spike-timing–dependent plasticity (STDP) can be interpreted as implementing the slowness principle. The authors conclude that their findings provide a link between SFA and trace learning, and a mathematical interpretation of STDP.
In this study, the authors used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate phenotypically unique NSCLC cell lines and found that these cells support each other to rapidly evolve a therapy-resistant phenotype via drug-induced cell state transitions, a behavior they termed "cooperative adaptation to therapy" (CAT). They developed a mathematical model that describes this phenomenon and found that it can significantly impact population growth. They also validated their findings using an ex vivo human tumor model. Their findings highlight the importance of understanding the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in acquired resistance and suggest that profiling for druggable targets alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy.
The study aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae in the Mbeya Region of Southwestern Tanzania. SFG-seropositivity was found to be 67.9% (range among nine sites: 42.8–91.4%). Multivariable analysis revealed an association with age, warmer temperatures, male gender, and low population density. At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher seroprevalence. The study suggests that SFG rickettsial infection is common in rural populations of Mbeya Region, and its spread is further limited by temperature and higher elevation.
The article describes the role of the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. From an RNAi screen for regulators of innate immune defense genes, the authors identified the two stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturases that synthesize oleate in C . elegans. They showed that the synthesis of oleate is necessary for the pathogen-mediated induction of immune defense genes. C . elegans deficient in oleate production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse human pathogens, which can be rescued by the addition of exogenous oleate. However, oleate is not sufficient to drive protective immune activation. The authors suggest an ancient link between nutrient stores, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection.
The present study highlights the potential of guanine riboswitches as antibacterial targets. The research team has identified two novel compounds, PC1 and PC2, which bind to guanine riboswitches and exhibit bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species. This effect is only observed when the guanine riboswitch is under the control of a gene coding for a GMP synthetase. The bacteria that exhibit this effect include S. aureus and C. difficile, which are known nosocomial pathogens responsible for significant mortality rates in hospitals and increased healthcare costs. The researchers have also shown that PC1 targets a different metabolic pathway than the bacterial cell wall, providing a new approach to antibiotic development. The study provides promising results for the development of new antibiotics and highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of riboswitch function in bacteria.
We studied how monkeys' hippocampal cells encoded and used the target of gaze (what the monkey was looking at) during navigation in a virtual reality maze. We found that the cells' activity was best fit by a fine-grained state space that included current position, view, and action contexts. This shows that the cells encoded multidimensional, task-situated knowledge related to the target of gaze, and that this information was useful for wayfinding.
The isthmic organizer (IsO) mediates the differentiation of the midbrain and hindbrain during vertebrate development. It is characterized by a specific pattern of locally restricted gene expression around the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB). A Boolean analysis of this pattern reveals key regulatory interactions in the IsO network. The analysis employs techniques from computational logic for the minimization of Boolean functions. Fgf8 is found to only maintain, rather than induce ectopic Wnt1 expression in mouse anterior neural plate/tube explants. Using mouse anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures, we provide experimental evidence that Fgf8 in fact only maintains, but does not induce ectopic Wnt1 expression in these explants. In combination with previously validated interactions, this finding allows for the construction of a regulatory network between key transcription and secreted factors at the MHB. Analyses of Boolean, differential equation and reaction-diffusion models of this network confirm that it is indeed able to explain the stable maintenance of the MHB as well as time-courses of expression patterns both under wild-type and various knock-out conditions. The spatial gene expression patterns around the MHB help us to understand the maintenance of this boundary on a systems level. In particular, the spatial pattern helps us to identify the maintaining, rather than inducing, effect of Fgf8 on Wnt1 expression.
Theileria annulata, a parasitic protozoan that infects bovine red blood cells, transforms and uncontrollably proliferates the cells. The transforming parasite produces many proteins that interact with cellular components and mediate the transformation process. One such protein is p104, which is produced on the surface of the transforming parasite and interacts with the host cell microtubules. In this study, the authors describe the identification and characterization of p104 as a host cell target protein of T. annulata. They show that p104 is a major schizont surface protein that functions as a bona fide EB1-binding protein, interacting with EB1 via a classic 'SxIP' motif. They also show that p104 is the first parasite-encoded EB1-binding protein described to date. The authors propose that p104 may play a role in the uncontrollable proliferation of the schizont by promoting persistent MT growth and suppressing catastrophes. Their findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of T. annulata transformation and may help in the development of new strategies for controlling the parasite.
Broken replication forks can cause DNA damage that is usually repaired by homologous recombination or break-induced replication (BIR). A study showed that in budding yeast, if replicative ligase Cdc9 was mildly insufficient, the cells had persistent DNA damage, likely due to broken replication forks, constitutive activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, and longer telomeres. Telomere lengthening required functional telomerase, the Mec1-Rad9-Rad53 DNA damage signaling cascade, and the BIR repair pathway components. The Mec1-Rad53 DNA damage signaling cascade also phosphorylated Pif1, which was important for the role of Pif1 in BIR and telomere lengthening. Two other mutants with impaired DNA replication, cdc44-5 and rrm3Δ, also had long telomeres and required the Pif1 phosphorylation locus for this effect. The study proposed that the passage of BIR forks through telomeres promotes telomerase activity and leads to telomere lengthening.
Onchocerciasis is an infection caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus . It is a major public health concern and can cause blindness, disabling dermatitis, and other symptoms. Diagnosis of onchocerciasis can be difficult and current methods rely on microfilariae found in skin snips. However, new serological tests have been developed, including a rapid immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) that uses four different Onchocerca volvulus antigens. These antigens are Ov-FAR-1 , Ov-API-1 , Ov-MSA-1 , and Ov-CPI-1 . The LIPS assay was tested on a large cohort of blinded sera from uninfected controls and patients with proven parasitic infection, including Onchocerca volvulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, Strongyloides stercoralis, and other potentially cross-reactive infections. The results showed that the four Ov antigens allowed for unequivocal differentiation between Ov-infected and uninfected sera with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Analysis of antibody titers to each of these four antigens revealed that they were markedly different and did not correlate. Compared to Ov-infected sera, patients infected with Wb, Ll, Ss, and other conditions had markedly lower geometric mean antibody titers to each of the Ov 4 antigens. The simplified method of using a mixture of the 4 Ov antigens simultaneously in the standard format or a quick 15-minute format ( QLIPS ) showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing the Ov-infected sera from the uninfected control sera. Finally, the QLIPS format had the best performance with 100% sensitivity and specificity values of 76%, 84%, and 93% for distinguishing Ov from Wb, Ll and Ss-infected sera. The multi-antigen LIPS assay can be used as a rapid, high throughput, and specific tool to not only to diagnose individual Ov infections but also as a sensitive and potentially point-of-care method for early detection of recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Ov infection.
The study aimed to evaluate the impact of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming on mean hemoglobin and the prevalence of anaemia , iron deficiency , and soil transmitted helminth infections in a rural population of women in northern Vietnam. The study found that after 54 months, mean hemoglobin rose from 122 g/L to 131 g/L, anemia prevalence fell from 38% to 18%, iron deficiency fell from 23% to 8%, while the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia was reduced to 4%. The prevalence of hookworm infection also reduced from 76% to 11%. The study also identified predictive factors for hematological outcomes.
EBV gp150 inhibits T cell activation by targeting HLA-A and HLA-B molecules. We generated EBV B cell lines expressing human HLA-A2 or HLA-A2 and CD1d and found that gp150 expression interferes with HLA-A2 presentation of both EBV and self-antigens. By contrast, gp150 does not inhibit presentation of HLA-A2 by HLA-A2+CD1d+ B cells. Moreover, gp150 inhibits activation of CD4+ T cells by interfering with the interaction of HLA-B molecules with their cognate TCRs, but does not affect activation of CD8+ T cells by HLA-A2+CD1d+ B cells. We also show that gp150 expression is required for EBV to efficiently lyse B cells in vitro. Together, these data support a role for gp150 in protecting EBV-infected B cells from destruction by CD8+ T cells.
The goal of this study was to examine the role of Tarp, a translocated effector protein of Chlamydia trachomatis, in the entry of the bacterium into host cells. Tarp has been previously shown to mediate actin polymerization, which is thought to play a role in the recruitment of actin to the site of attachment and entry. The study showed that Tarp is highly conserved among all known chlamydial species, and that all species possess at least one and up to four functional actin binding domains. The study also demonstrated that purified recombinant Tarp from all chlamydial species were capable of nucleating actin filament formation in vitro. In addition, a peptide antiserum with affinity to the actin binding domain prevented Tarp-mediated actin nucleation and significantly reduced host cell susceptibility to chlamydial infection in vitro. Overall, the study suggests that Tarp-mediated actin polymerization is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species and may play an important role in bacterial entry.
Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis that affects many mammalian species, including water buffalo and carabao. It is a public health concern because it causes debilitating disease and adds to the economic burden of communities. The new FEA-SD technique removes much of the bulk debris and cellulose material in feces of bovines and other ruminants, allowing improved microscopic examination of S . japonicum eggs. The study was performed on 13 naturally infected Chinese water buffaloes and 25 carabao from the Philippines. The FEA-SD technique is efficient and reproducible and provides an accurate quantitative method for determining S . japonicum infection in bovines and other ruminants. It is less costly than real-time PCR and more efficient than MHT in detecting S . japonicum eggs.
This paper describes the results of a genetic study of a mouse model for progeria, a disease characterized by premature aging. The authors found that the mouse model carries a mutation in a gene that encodes an enzyme called progerin, which is responsible for the premature aging seen in the mice. The authors then used a variety of techniques to study the effects of progerin on the mice, including measurements of bone density and mechanical properties, as well as analyses of blood and tissue samples. The results of these studies suggest that progerin has a number of negative effects on the mice, including decreased bone density and mechanical properties, as well as changes in the composition of blood and tissues. The authors conclude that their findings provide important insights into the pathogenesis of progeria and may help to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.
Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly, has an important role in scientific research. The fruit fly genome is relatively small and simple, making it easy to study. Additionally, fruit flies have a short life cycle, making it easy to perform experiments on them. Scientists have been studying the fruit fly for over a century and have learned a lot about its biology. However, there are still many mysteries about the fruit fly and its role in nature.
Male Ae. aegypti can be marked with rhodamine B by feeding them sugar-solution containing dye. This study tested the effects of rhodamine B marking on male survival, mating success, and marking longevity. The results indicate that rhodamine B marking has no negative effects on male survival, mating success, or marking longevity. The study also found that feeding males with sugar-solution containing rhodamine B increased the rate of body and seminal fluid marking. This finding suggests that rhodamine B could be used as a quick and easy marker for male Ae. aegypti in mating competitiveness experiments.
A superantigen is a toxin that activates an immune response by binding to both T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The study shows that superantigens bind directly to CD28 on T cells to activate the immune response. The authors also show that peptides that block the binding of superantigens to CD28 can protect mice from lethal shock. These findings identify CD28 as a receptor for superantigen toxins and show a novel role for CD28 in pathogen recognition.
Understanding the mechanisms of pluripotency and cellular reprogramming is crucial for developing new approaches to regenerative medicine. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are a model system for studying these processes, as they have the capacity to differentiate into any cell type in the body. However, mESCs have a relatively fast cell cycle, which makes them difficult to study in terms of their cellular reprogramming dynamics. In this study, the authors have used RNA interference (RNAi) to selectively inhibit the expression of a group of genes called the "cell cycle inhibitor" (CCI) genes. They found that inhibition of CCI genes slows down the cell cycle of mESCs and that this slowing down is associated with a decrease in the expression of genes that are involved in cellular reprogramming. Specifically, they found that inhibition of CCI genes leads to a decrease in the expression of genes involved in pluripotency maintenance, such as Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, as well as genes involved in epigenetic regulation, such as Dnmt3a and Ezh2. The authors also found that inhibition of CCI genes leads to an increase in the expression of genes involved in differentiation, such as Tfap2c and Sox17. The authors conclude that the slowing down of the cell cycle of mESCs is associated with a decrease in pluripotency maintenance and an increase in differentiation. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms of pluripotency and cellular reprogramming in mESCs and has important implications for the development of new approaches to regenerative medicine.
In this report, the authors analyze the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in dengue virus (DENV) infection. They show that pDCs from dengue fever (DF) patients express high levels of the pro-apoptotic protein TRAIL, which is involved in the control of viral infection. The authors also show that pDCs can decrease DENV infection in monocytes, which are the main target cells for the virus. This effect is likely due to the production of IFN-α by pDCs. The authors suggest that pDCs play an important role in the defense against DENV infection and that they may be used as a target for therapeutic intervention in the future.
TB is the most frequent bacterial infection globally and the leading cause of death from infectious diseases. The treatment of TB is complicated and time-consuming, and the current treatment strategies are ineffective against latent TB. TNF plays a central role in the pathogenesis of TB, and its inhibition has been shown to be effective in treating TB in animal models. However, inhibition of TNF in humans is associated with increased risk of cancer, and there are concerns about the safety of anti-TNF therapy. Therefore, there is a need for safer and more effective strategies for treating TB. We developed a mathematical model of the host-pathogen system for TB and used it to simulate the dynamics of TNF production and the effects of anti-TNF antibody and receptor fusion molecules on TNF production. Our results indicate that TNF production is a complex process that is influenced by multiple factors, including the bacterial load, immune cell recruitment, and cytokine signaling. Anti-TNF antibody and receptor fusion molecules can effectively suppress TNF production, but the timing and duration of treatment are critical for success. Overall, our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of TNF production in TB and suggest that anti-TNF therapy could be an effective strategy for treating TB.
In this study, the authors used the results of Phase 1 from the 1000 Genomes Project to investigate variation in loss of ancestral retrocopies among different human populations. They also examined retrocopy expression levels using RNA-Seq data derived from the Ilumina BodyMap project, as well as data from lymphoblastoid cell lines provided by the Geuvadis Consortium. The authors developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the reference human genome and experimentally confirmed the existence of the detected retrocopies and determined their presence or absence in the human genomes of 17 different populations. Altogether, they were able to detect 193 RDVs; the majority resulted from retrocopy deletion. Most of these RDVs had not been previously reported. The authors experimentally confirmed the expression of 11 ancestral retrogenes that underwent deletion in certain individuals. The frequency of their deletion, with the exception of one retrogene, is very low. The expression, conservation, and low rate of deletion of the remaining 10 retrocopies may suggest some functionality. Aside from the presence or absence of expressed retrocopies, the authors also searched for differences in retrocopy expression levels between populations and found 9 retrogenes that undergo statistically significant differential expression.
This study compared the inflammatory response to different types of cysticerci (different locations in the brain) in pigs that received an anthelmintic drug (praziquantel) or did not receive any treatment. The study found that cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma (tissue that makes up the brain) caused a stronger inflammatory response compared to cysticerci located in the meninges (tissue that surrounds the brain) or both the parenchyma and meninges (corticomeningeal). The study also found that disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was associated with treatment in the parenchymal tissue. The suboptimal inflammatory response to cysticidal drugs in cysticerci located in the meninges may be one reason why subarachnoid NCC is generally refractory to treatment compared to parenchymal NCC.
Yaws, a sexually transmitted disease, has been reported in Ghana in the past. It is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue. To determine if yaws is still present in Ghana, a survey was conducted in 30 communities. Children with skin lesions were tested for syphilis serology, and PCR for T. pallidum ssp. pertenue and H. ducreyi. The survey found that H. ducreyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, but the majority of lesions remain unexplained. The survey did not find evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws. The findings suggest that the previously reported cases of yaws in Ghana could be due to other infections.
HIV remains difficult to cure despite the availability of highly effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). This therapy can suppress viral replication to undetectable levels in the blood, but it does not completely eliminate the virus from the body. HIV persists in a small number of cells, known as the HIV reservoir, and this reservoir can slowly replenish itself even in the presence of ART. There is an urgent need to develop new strategies to eradicate the HIV reservoir, and new compounds that target the pathways of HIV persistence are currently under development. In this study, we evaluated the effects of two compounds that target the Jak-STAT pathway, ruxolitinib and tofacitinib, on HIV persistence in vitro. We found that ruxolitinib and tofacitinib can suppress HIV replication and reduce the size of the HIV reservoir. We also found that these compounds can prevent the expansion of CD4 memory T cells and suppress the production of inflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggest that the Jak-STAT pathway may be a promising target for HIV eradication therapies.
Baculoviruses are used to control insect pests. They specifically infect insects and are harmless to humans and the environment. However, the ability of baculoviruses to control insect pests depends on their host range. Some baculoviruses can only infect a few species of insects, while others can infect a wide range of insects. The virulence of baculoviruses also varies depending on the insect host. This study examined the host response of Spodoptera exigua to infection by two different species of baculovirus. The results showed that both viruses caused a down-regulation of immune-related genes. However, this down-regulation was more pronounced for the virus that specifically infected S. exigua. The down-regulation of immune-related genes may contribute to the virulence of baculoviruses.
This study is about apomixis, a type of asexual reproduction through seeds in which the resulting offspring are clones of the mother plant. Apomixis has the potential to be applied in agriculture by allowing for the propagation of desired genetic traits. However, apomixis is rare in crops, and attempts to introduce it through crossing have failed. In this study, researchers identified a gene called OSD1 that controls entry into the second meiotic division in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. They then created a mutation in this gene and combined it with two other mutations to create a genotype called MiMe in which meiosis is replaced by mitosis. This genotype produces functional diploid gametes that are genetically identical to the mother plant. This study is an important step towards understanding and engineering apomixis in crops.
The current study investigates the impact of tissue-specific information on the accuracy of disease-gene prioritization algorithms. The authors create tissue-specific protein interaction networks by combining tissue-specific gene expression data and generic protein interaction networks. They then apply these tissue-specific networks to prioritize disease-causing genes. The authors find that integrating tissue-specific information significantly improves the accuracy of disease gene prioritization. They also show that tissue-specific protein interaction networks can infer novel disease-tissue associations. The authors propose a new method for ranking disease-causing genes based on their expression in a specific tissue. They find that lowly expressed genes tend to be disease-causing in many tissues, rather than a single tissue. The authors also find that randomly assigning genes to tissues leads to similar results, suggesting that many diseases have a broad tissue distribution.
The paper describes the development of a mathematical model to study the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes that transmit diseases like malaria. The model takes into account the different ways in which insecticides can be deployed and their effectiveness against mosquitoes with different levels of resistance. The model also accounts for the genetic and environmental factors that can influence the spread of resistance. The authors emphasize the importance of using mathematical models to guide decision-making on insecticide deployment strategies and to identify the best ways to minimize the spread of insecticide resistance. The paper also discusses some of the challenges and limitations of the model and suggests ways in which it could be improved in the future.
This study used cutting-edge technology to analyze the saliva of the blood-sucking insect Rhodnius neglectus, which transmits Chagas disease. The saliva was analyzed using next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins present in the saliva. This is important because the proteins in the saliva help the insect to feed on blood and to evade the host's immune system. The study identified many proteins that are likely to be involved in these processes, including lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, antigen-5, metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding proteins. The results of this study will help scientists to understand more about how blood-sucking insects feed and transmit diseases, which could lead to the development of new treatments for diseases like Chagas.
We have used the nematode C. elegans to study how bacterial environments affect the expression of genes involved in metabolism and innate immunity. We used mutants of 21 different genes to determine how each gene affects fitness and lifespan in a specific bacterial environment. We found that the response of the nematode to its environment is reflected in the genes that are differentially expressed. We also found that the extent of differential expression between bacterial environments is predictive of the effect of mutations in those genes on life history traits in those environments. Our results suggest that transcriptional profiling can be used to identify genes that may play important roles in ecosystems where native soil nematodes interact with soil bacteria.
Mammalian embryos start out as a single fertilized egg that divides multiple times to form a morula and then compacts to form a blastocyst. The blastocyst is made up of two main types of cells: the inner cell mass (ICM) and the trophectoderm (TE). These two cell types have different functions in the embryo. The ICM gives rise to the embryo proper, while the TE forms the placenta. The lineage decision between ICM and TE cells is made during the early stages of embryo development, and it is important for the formation of a normal embryo. Researchers have studied this process using live imaging and mathematical modeling. They found that stochasticity in the expression of key genes helps to promote cell plasticity, which is important for organizing the blastocyst. They also found that asymmetries in gene expression levels can provide a way to gain the benefits of stochasticity while minimizing its potentially detrimental effects. Additionally, the researchers found that by controlling the timing and pace of cell fate specification, the embryo can temporally modulate plasticity and create a time window during which each cell can continuously read its environment and adjust its fate. These findings suggest that noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst.
The paper investigates the molecular basis for antibody recognition. It explores the potential for polyspecificity, or the ability of an antibody to bind multiple unrelated antigens, in germline antibodies, which are the starting structures in the germline repertoire. The paper presents a computational design process that identifies residues in the germline gene sequence that are critical for polyspecificity. The study finds that key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the framework are important contributors for polyspecificity in germline antibodies. The study provides insights into the molecular basis for the flexibility and diversity of the antibody repertoire.
In this study, the authors developed a continuum model of phase transitions in locust populations. They focused on two behavioral phases: solitary and gregarious. By analyzing the model, the authors found that the density of locusts plays a crucial role in phase transitions. They identified the critical density beyond which gregarious locusts form traveling patches. The authors also found that the ratio of gregarious to solitary locusts depends on the conversion rates between the two phases. They concluded that their model provides a useful framework for understanding the dynamics of phase transitions in locust populations.
Here, we use tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus as a model to dissect the class II flavivirus membrane fusion pathway and the associated structural rearrangements of the envelope protein E. We found a monomeric conformation of E that can be postulated as a transient intermediate of the fusion pathway. TBE virus is a member of the flavivirus genus (family Flaviviridae), which encompasses a number of other important human pathogens such as yellow fever, dengue, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis viruses. Mature flavivirus particles are characterized by an external icosahedral glycoprotein cage formed by 90 dimers of E. The structure of sE in the prefusion form shows that the three domains of sE are aligned along a rod-like molecule, with the C terminus and the fusion peptide (FP) lying at the two distal ends of the molecule. In the postfusion form, as shown in Figure 1E and 1F, DIII is displaced from its original location and thus becomes positioned at the side of DI with its C terminus pointing toward the FP. Under physiological conditions, this process is triggered by the acidic pH in endosomes during receptor-mediated endocytosis and rapidly followed by E trimerization. The monomeric conformation of E is obtained by exposing TBE virions to alkaline pH instead of the physiological acidic pH. Full fusion, however, can be induced by subsequent exposure to acidic pH, leading to hairpin formation and E trimerization, which drive the merger of the two lipid bilayers. The demonstration of a membrane-inserted prehairpin intermediate has important implications for the existing models of class II viral membrane fusion.
In this study, the authors investigate the distribution of extinction risks for two of the best-studied floras, the Cape of South Africa and the United Kingdom, for which practically complete regional Red List data have recently been published. They find that threatened plant species are over-represented within species-poor clades, which suggests a potential link between the processes of speciation and extinction. They also find that plant species' present-day vulnerabilities can be explained by their recent evolutionary past, using detailed phylogenetic data for the Cape to reveal an unusual phylogenetic signal in extinction risks for plants. This signal suggests that species with close evolutionary relationships are more likely to be vulnerable to extinction than those with more distant relationships, supporting the hypothesis that speciation and extinction are coupled. The authors also evaluate the link between speciation mode and extinction risk, finding that species with the fastest diversification rates are also the most vulnerable to extinction. They conclude that these results link speciation and extinction derive from an analysis of the unique flora found within the Cape region of South Africa and might not extrapolate across less diverse biomes with different evolutionary histories. However, they note that the trend for threatened species to fall within species-poor clades has been observed within the relatively depauperate floras of the UK and North America. They suggest that species turnover (speciation and extinction) might be rapid generally for plants, and high extinction rates may not be unusual over evolutionary timescales. Because even rapid speciation occurs over timescales too long for practical management, conservation efforts must focus urgently on reducing rates at which species are lost. They also highlight the importance of considering the key traits linked to high extinction risk when deciding upon conservation priorities, and the need for further research on the drivers of plant extinction.
Dectin-1 is a C-type lectin receptor that plays an important role in the recognition of Candida albicans by macrophages. In this study, the authors identify two novel proteins that interact with Dectin-1 in macrophages: BTK and Vav1. They show that BTK is required for the phagocytosis of C. albicans by macrophages, while Vav1 is required for the recruitment of the cytoskeletal protein actin to the phagocytic cup. They also provide evidence that Dectin-1 and BTK are involved in the recruitment of the signaling molecule PI(3,4)P2 to the phagocytic cup, which is important for the activation of Vav1 and the phagocytosis of C. albicans. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the recognition and phagocytosis of C. albicans by macrophages.
Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is a virus that affects cattle and humans. The virus has been found in Madagascar and researchers are trying to understand the environment and behaviors that are associated with the virus in order to prevent future outbreaks. The researchers analyzed data from a national survey of cattle and humans in Madagascar in 2008 and 2011-2013. They found that humid environments, high cattle density, and contact with raw milk were associated with the presence of the virus in humans. They also found that high cattle density was associated with the presence of the virus in cattle. Finally, the researchers used computer modeling to predict the areas where the virus is most likely to be found in cattle in Madagascar.
This manuscript describes the use of yeast to study the propagation of prion diseases, which are caused by infectious proteins that replicate themselves through the conversion of host proteins. The study focuses on RNQ1, a protein that is involved in the propagation of two prion diseases in yeast, [PSI+] and [PIN+]. The study finds that RNQ1 contains multiple prion domains that can independently propagate [PIN+] in yeast. The study also finds that the propagation of [PIN+] is not limited to the prion domains that are directly involved in the propagation of [PIN+], but is also influenced by the overall structure of RNQ1. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of prion propagation and highlights the importance of considering the overall structure of prion proteins in understanding their functions.
Deep learning is a powerful modern technique in machine learning that uses multilayer neural networks to learn a feature-based function from input (e.g., hundreds of correlated summary statistics of data) to output (e.g., population genetic parameters of interest). It has been successfully applied to population genetic inference and learning informative features of data. As an example, the authors applied deep learning to jointly infer natural selection and demography, which has not been done before. They found that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome.
This paper explains how human papillomavirus (HPV) is linked to cervical cancer and how it is transmitted. It describes the different types of HPV, and the role of the E6 and E7 proteins in the development of cancer. The paper also explains how HPV interacts with the cell cycle and DNA repair pathways, and how it affects cell growth and division. Additionally, the paper discusses the different treatment options for HPV and cervical cancer, including vaccines and chemotherapy.
This research article presents the results of a comprehensive investigation into the elimination of the human onchocerciasis parasite, Onchocerca volvulus, in the Southern Chiapas focus in Mexico. The research team collected data on the prevalence of infective parasites in black flies, as well as the number of people with evidence of infection in their eyes or skin. They also conducted a large-scale serological survey of children to determine the prevalence of antibodies to the Ov16 antigen of O. volvulus. Based on the data collected, the authors conclude that the Southern Chiapas focus has likely achieved transmission interruption, as the prevalence of infective black flies and people with evidence of infection in their eyes or skin have declined dramatically. They also note that the prevalence of antibodies to Ov16 has decreased to near zero in the overall population sample. The authors suggest that ongoing surveillance will be necessary to ensure that transmission interruption is maintained, and that elimination of the parasite is achieved. They also note the importance of maintaining ivermectin treatment, as this is currently the only drug that is effective against O. volvulus.
Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium that causes foodborne illnesses in humans. The bacterium can survive and replicate in various environments, including food and the environment. When ingested by humans, the bacteria can cause illnesses such as listeriosis, which can be fatal in some cases. Understanding how the bacterium adapts to different environments and how it interacts with other organisms is crucial for developing effective strategies to control its spread and prevent illnesses.
In this paper, researchers examined the role of mutS in the survival of Vibrio cholerae in the mouse gut. They found that mutS mutants have a significant advantage in colonization of mice with a low antioxidant treatment, but not in mice with high antioxidant treatment. They also found that the advantage of mutS mutants in colonization is due to an increase in catalase production, rugose colony variants, and a mutation rate that is higher in the gut of mice with low antioxidant treatment. This study suggests that mutS mutants have a selective advantage in the mouse gut under certain conditions, and that this advantage is due to a combination of factors, including increased catalase production and rugose colony variants.
Here we report a comprehensive study of the role of the Mlh1-Mlh3 complex in recombination and crossing over in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have used 57 novel mlh3 alleles, including 56 point mutations and one gene deletion, to analyze the structure-function relationships of this complex in vivo. Our findings indicate that the Mlh1-Mlh3 complex plays a central role in the recombination of homologous sequences, as well as the formation of meiotic crossovers. We have also used an integrated approach, combining high-resolution structural analysis with biochemical and genetic studies, to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying the functions of this complex. Our results provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of meiosis and recombination, as well as a framework for further investigation of the role of these processes in human disease.
Intense use of antibiotics has led to a rapid increase in population levels of drug resistance. This has been generally necessary due to low fitness costs of resistance in the absence of treatment. Host contact structure plays a crucial role in the reversion dynamics of drug resistance. It can affect both the dynamics during treatment and the competition dynamics after treatment is stopped. Contact structure affects the distribution of infected hosts and therefore influences the residual network left for the second pathogen to spread. In the absence of treatment, heterogeneous contact structure slows down the reversion process. However, this effect is strongest in the biologically relevant case when fitness differences between sensitive and resistant strains in the absence of treatment are small.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are complex neurodevelopmental diseases that affect social interaction and communication, and result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. While a large number of genes associated with ASD have been identified, the genetic basis of ASD is still not well understood. Using Drosophila, a simple yet versatile in vivo model, we investigated the genetic interactions that may contribute to neurological phenotypes like ASD. Specifically, we focused on the unique Drosophila orthologues of genes affected by large structural variations (such as copy number variants) that have been identified in individuals with ASD. We examined synaptic and circadian neurological phenotypes resulting from the dosage variants of unique human:fly orthologues in Drosophila. Our study identified numerous synergistic interactions between pairs of informatically-identified candidate genes whose orthologues are jointly affected by large de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals with ASD. These interactions affect both synaptic and circadian neurological processes, supporting distinct molecular aetiologies. Our results demonstrate how combining information from informatic approaches with experimental validation in vivo can shed light on the underlying genetic mechanisms of complex neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.
The article titled "Visualization of T cells in the brain during malaria infection" by Johnston et al. describes the use of two-photon microscopy to track T cells within the brain during infection with the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei ANKA. The authors used immunofluorescence and transgenic mice to identify T cells and infected parasites, respectively. They also used a novel CX3CR1-iDTR mouse model to deplete CX3CR1-expressing macrophages. The authors found that T cells accumulate within the brain during infection and that they are not required for parasite development. The authors also found that infected red blood cells are found within perivascular spaces and not the subarachnoid space, as previously thought. They also found that the arrest of T cells within the brain during malaria infection is not due to an increased interaction with infected red blood cells. The authors suggest that further studies are needed to understand the role of T cells during malaria infection.
Tungiasis is a serious skin disease caused by a type of sand flea. It occurs in areas with poor housing, low income, and lack of access to basic sanitation. This study was conducted in Vihiga County in Kenya to determine the prevalence of tungiasis and identify risk factors. A total of 437 participants aged 5 years and above were examined for the presence of tungiasis. The overall prevalence was found to be 21.5% (95% CI: 17.7–25.3%). The study found that people with low monthly income, earthen floor, lack of toilet facilities, age of participant ≤14 years, no regular use of closed footwear, and common resting place inside the house were at higher risk of getting tungiasis. This study has important implications for public health interventions to control and prevent tungiasis.
Auxin is an important hormone that regulates the growth and development of plants. It is involved in many different processes, including root development, lateral root initiation, and shoot gravitropism. The transport of auxin is controlled by a variety of transporters, including the PIN class of efflux transporters and the AUX1/LAX influx transporters. It has been shown that auxin transport is regulated by cytokinins, which are another important class of plant hormones that are involved in processes such as cell division, shoot development, and root growth. The interaction between auxin and cytokinins has been proposed to play an important role in the patterning of the vascular system in plants. In this study, the authors developed a computational model of auxin transport that takes into account the regulation of auxin transport by cytokinins. They used this model to explore the role of cytokinins in the patterning of the vascular system and found that variations in cytokinin levels are not required for correct auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response are crucial for the necessary feedbacks. The authors also found that hormonal regulation of auxin efflux is important for the robustness of the auxin maximum. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying vascular patterning in plants.
The study identifies the TF activating NOS transcription in response to population density variation in locusts, uncovering several novel components of the NPF/NO signaling cascade underlying phase-related locomotor plasticity in locusts. The results show that a neural neuropeptide F ( NPF )/nitric oxide ( NO ) signaling pathway plays an essential role in phase-related locomotor plasticity, which results from the sequential changes in the phosphorylation and transcriptional states of nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) as regulated by NPF1a and NPF2 systems, respectively. The study identifies CREB-B as the TF activating NOS transcription in response to population density variation and shows that NPF2-regulated NOS transcription is responsible for long-term locomotor plasticity. The findings provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying phase-related locomotor plasticity in locusts.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of Zelda (ZLD), a zinc-finger protein that plays a key role in early development in Drosophila melanogaster, during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT). To do this, they use chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to determine the genomic landscape of ZLD binding as the embryo progresses through the MZT. The authors find that ZLD is bound to a large number of regions throughout the genome at all stages, and that many of these regions do not become active until after the MZT. They also identify a large number of enhancers bound by ZLD at cycle 14 and find that these enhancers are enriched for motifs related to early gene activation. The authors conclude that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT.
The circadian clock is a biological system that regulates physiological processes in a 24-hour cycle. These processes, including sleep, hormone production, and body temperature, are controlled by a set of proteins that interact with each other in specific ways. These interactions are crucial for the proper functioning of the clock. However, little is known about the timing of these interactions and how they contribute to the regulation of circadian processes. In this study, the authors used a yeast-two-hybrid approach to identify novel interactions among circadian clock proteins in mammals. They then used molecular and genetic techniques to investigate the timing of these interactions and their effects on circadian processes. The authors found that many of the identified interactions occur at specific times of day, and that these interactions are important for the proper functioning of the circadian clock. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of circadian processes in mammals.
Nematode parasite allergens are rare lipid-binding proteins that are produced in large quantities. The authors of this paper have now determined the structure of one of these proteins in solution. Using this structure, they have identified two separate hydrophobic ligand-binding sites within the protein. These sites could be used to target drugs that will reduce the effectiveness of the nematode.
This is a very important paper for me. Please make sure you understand it. This study was about ciguatera, a type of fish poisoning that occurs in tropical and subtropical waters around the world. The study looked at the incidence of ciguatera in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) from 1973 to 2008. It found that there has been a 60% increase in the incidence of ciguatera in the last 35 years. This is a big increase and it raises the status of ciguatera to an acute and chronic illness with major public health significance. The study also looked at the social consequences of ciguatera, such as changing diet and associated medical conditions. It found that ciguatera has a significant impact on the health and well-being of people in the PICTs. This paper has important implications for public health and highlights the need for more research and resources to manage and prevent ciguatera.
Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is a serious health problem in Latin America. In this disease, the immune system does not eliminate the parasite, and it hides in tissues, leading to chronic infection. CD4+CD8+ T cells are a small subset of T cells that express both CD4 and CD8 molecules. In this study, the authors analyzed the role of these cells in the immune response against T . cruzi infection in patients with chronic Chagas disease. They found that the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells was higher in patients with Chagas disease than in healthy controls. Additionally, these cells expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors, which are molecules that inhibit the function of T cells. After treatment with benznidazole, the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells decreased, and the expression of inhibitory receptors on these cells also decreased. This suggests that benznidazole treatment may improve the function of CD4+CD8+ T cells against T . cruzi infection. The authors conclude that this study provides important information about the role of CD4+CD8+ T cells in the immune response against T . cruzi infection in patients with chronic Chagas disease and the potential of benznidazole treatment to improve the function of these cells.
This research report describes a comprehensive study on the role of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C2 (PLC2) in phosphoinositide metabolism, seedling growth, and ER stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana. The study shows that PLC2 is the primary phosphoinositide-specific PLC in Arabidopsis, which is required for seedling growth. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the plc2-1 mutant is more sensitive to ER stress than the wild type, and this is attributed to the increased levels of phosphoinositides in the plc2-1 mutant. The findings of this study provide new insights into the roles of PLC2 in phosphoinositide metabolism and ER stress response, and have potential implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant growth and development.
The paper is about a new way to measure the causal power of systems. In this approach, the causal power of a system is evaluated by taking into account how much information about the system's past influences its present state, and how much information about the system's present state influences its future. This approach is used to study the relationship between the micro level (atoms and molecules) and the macro level (the behavior of the system as a whole) in a way that is not biased towards either level. By analyzing the information flow within a system, the authors found that macro systems can have higher causal power than micro systems. They also identified local maxima of causal power at different scales of the system, and showed that these local maxima correspond to emergent properties of the system. The authors' approach provides a new framework for understanding the relationship between micro and macro levels in complex systems.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are molecules with the ability to react with other molecules, which are produced in the mitochondrial respiratory chain during oxidative phosphorylation, and they play a role in signaling pathways of adaptation to environmental stimuli and in the development of destructive processes in some tissues. The main sources of ROS are complexes I, II, and III of the electron transport chain. The processes of electron transport in complexes I and III are characterized by the participation of quinone-bound proteins of different nature in the reduction of ubiquinone. The electron transport in complexes I and III is accompanied by the translocation of protons across the membrane of the mitochondrion, which leads to the formation of the transmembrane potential difference (ΔΨm). This transmembrane potential difference (ΔΨm) drives the transport of ions across the membrane of the mitochondrion and the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In the model of electron transport in complexes I and III, the reduction of ubiquinone is carried out in two stages. The first stage is characterized by the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol outside the matrix of the mitochondrion, and the second stage is characterized by the reduction of ubiquinol inside the matrix of the mitochondrion. The model takes into account the stoichiometry of electron transport reactions, which describes the number of electrons and protons involved in the reactions. The model was validated by fitting experimental data on the effect of inhibitors of complex I on the rate of electron transport and the synthesis of ATP. The validation of the model showed the importance of the electron transport chain in the synthesis of ATP and the production of ROS. The model can be used as a basis for further study of the interaction between complexes I and III of the electron transport chain and the production of ROS.
In this article, we report the effects of mutations of motor proteins on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. Our results indicate that mutants with altered stall forces might determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are outnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. We show that mutants gain a competitive advantage and lead to an increase in the expected run-length when the load on the cargo is in the vicinity of the mutant’s stalling force or a multiple of its stalling force. We further develop a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types. This technique determines transition rates between various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo using the transition rates between various absolute configurations. This enables a computation of biologically relevant quantities like average velocity and run-length without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations. Our method is easily implementable and we provide a software package for general use.
In this study, researchers examined how a selective functional ablation of the Cacna1c gene affected the learning process in mice. Using a detailed, individual-level analysis of learning on an operant cue discrimination task, they showed that while both groups of mice (with and without the genetic modification) managed to increase reward feedback across trials, the majority of the KO mice did so by adapting an outcome-based strategy, while the majority of controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association rule. These results highlight that much more mechanistic insight could be gained by examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential behavioral strategies.
This study examines the effects of temperature on the reproductive success of Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The study found that high temperatures can negatively affect the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive strategy used by Wolbachia to control arboviral diseases, and can lead to a decrease in the density of Wolbachia in the mosquito host. These findings suggest that the success of Wolbachia as a biological control agent may be influenced by environmental conditions such as temperature.
Adenoviruses are common human pathogens that have also been developed as vectors for gene therapies and genetic vaccines. Researchers wanted to learn more about the natural history of adenovirus infections in different non-human primates. They discovered that healthy populations of chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and macaques shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in their stool. This shedding was much less frequent in humans. The researchers purified and fully sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 novel adenoviruses from macaques. They found evidence of recombination between different adenoviruses in the natural history of B and E viruses. Their results show that zoonotic transmissions have occurred in the natural history of adenoviruses and that asymptomatic shedding of live adenoviruses should be considered in the design and interpretation of studies with adenovirus vectors. The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoonotic transmissions warrants caution for primate handling and housing.
This article describes the use of molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the energetics of unwrapping nucleosomal DNA. The authors performed ABMD simulations with multiple walkers to generate conformational ensembles of the outer-turn unwrapping process and calculated the free-energy profiles. The results suggest that the unwrapping of the outer-turn of nucleosomal DNA costs about 11.5 kcal/mol and occurs asymmetrically, with one end unwrapping while the other remains wrapped. The study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of nucleosomal DNA unwrapping that can be used to improve our understanding of epigenetic regulations and the mechanisms of transcription.
In this study, the authors used a variety of techniques to investigate the role of Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) in neuronal damage caused by oxidative stress. They found that ApoD is endocytosed by astrocytes and localizes to lysosomes, where it plays a protective role by preventing lysosomal membrane permeabilization and mitigating oxidative stress-induced lysosomal alkalinization. The study provides important insights into the protective role of ApoD in neuronal damage caused by oxidative stress and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases.
This paper compares the life cycle parameters and susceptibility to Leishmania donovani of two Phlebotomus orientalis colonies from Ethiopia, one from a lowland site and one from a highland site. The authors find that there are differences in life cycle parameters between the two colonies, but no genetic differences. They also find that the two colonies have different susceptibilities to Leishmania donovani, with the highland colony being more susceptible. The authors also report on cross-mating studies and the development of successful F1 hybrids between the two colonies. The paper provides important information on the biology and susceptibility of Phlebotomus orientalis to Leishmania donovani in Ethiopia.
The Chinese government has identified advanced schistosomiasis as a leading public health priority due to its serious health and economic impacts. However, it has not been included in the estimates of schistosomiasis burden in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Therefore, the quality of life and disability weight (DW) for the advanced cases of schistosomiasis japonica were estimated in a re-estimation of burden of disease due to schistosomiasis. A patient-based questionnaire evaluation was performed for advanced schistosomiasis japonica. Suspected or officially registered advanced cases in a Schistosoma japonicum-hyperendemic county of the People's Republic of China were screened using a short questionnaire and physical examination. Disability and morbidity were assessed in confirmed cases using the European quality of life questionnaire with an additional cognitive dimension (known as the “EQ-5D plus”), ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. The age-specific DW of advanced schistosomiasis japonica was estimated based on patients' self-rated health scores on the visual analogue scale of the questionnaire. The relationships between health status, morbidity and DW were explored using multivariate regression models. Of 506 candidates, 215 cases were evaluated and most of them reported impairments in at least one health dimension such as pain or discomfort, usual activities, and anxiety or depression. The overall DW was 0.447 and age-specific DWs ranged from 0.378 among individuals aged 30–44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged ≥60 years. DWs are positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were protective factors for quality of life. These patient-preference disability estimates could provide updated data for a revision of the GBD, as well as for evidence-based decision-making in the national schistosomiasis control program in China.
The article describes a study that used national census data to estimate the prevalence of disability in Kenya's tsetse belts. The study aimed to identify whether living in tsetse-endemic areas is associated with an increased prevalence of disability. The study found that individuals living in tsetse-endemic areas had a higher prevalence of disability than those living outside these areas. The study also found that residents of tsetse-endemic areas were more likely to have disability than migrants, and that poverty levels and household characteristics did not significantly affect the prevalence of disability. The study concluded that the tsetse fly's impact on human health occurs via two exposure pathways: directly from the bite of a pathogenic tsetse fly resulting in HAT infection or indirectly, as the potential for AAT takes land out of agricultural production and diseased livestock leads to morbidity and mortality. The study recommends that future research should focus on developing and implementing tsetse control strategies that can address the health and economic impacts of tsetse-endemic areas.
The HIV replication process is activated by various compounds, including hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). In this study, the mechanism by which HMBA activates HIV transcription is explored. The authors found that HMBA activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads to the disruption of the large complex (LC) and the release of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) to the HIV promoter. This results in the transcriptional activation of HIV and the production of new viral particles.
The paper "Detection of Leishmania virus DNA in clinical Leishmania donovani isolates and its application for the prediction of parasite virulence" describes the development of a new method for detecting Leishmania virus DNA in Leishmania donovani parasites. The method involves the use of a monoclonal antibody, J2, which specifically binds to Leishmania virus DNA. The authors demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of the method using a variety of experimental approaches, including dot blot analysis, immunoblotting, and fluorescence microscopy. They also show that the method can be used to predict the virulence of Leishmania parasites, based on the level of Leishmania virus DNA detected. Overall, this paper provides important new insights into the biology of Leishmania parasites and the role of Leishmania virus in their pathogenesis.
The study investigates the role of pedestals in colonization and pathogenesis of EHEC and EPEC strains. The study shows that the bacterial protein EspFU promotes motility and colonization of EHEC strains on polarized epithelial cells by driving actin polymerization. The study also shows that EspFU does not affect colonization of EPEC strains on polarized cells, but does enhance motility. The study also provides insights into the role of pedestals in colonization and pathogenesis of EPEC and EHEC strains in vivo.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small membrane-bound organelles secreted from cells. They play important roles in cell-to-cell communication and can carry various cargo such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. One common method for isolating EVs is using differential centrifugation, where the samples are centrifuged at different speeds and the EVs are collected from the pellet at the higher speed. However, this method can be time-consuming and may result in contamination of the EVs with other cellular components. An alternative method for isolating EVs is using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), which separates the EVs based on their size. This method is faster and more efficient than differential centrifugation, but it requires a special column and solvent. In this study, we compared the two methods for isolating EVs from the helminth parasite Fasciola hepatica. We found that the SEC method produced smaller and purer EVs than the differential centrifugation method. We also found that the SEC method resulted in less contamination of the EVs with other cellular components. These findings suggest that the SEC method is a more suitable and efficient method for isolating EVs from Fasciola hepatica.
Here we present the details of a reverse engineering study of gap gene patterning in Drosophila embryos. Using experimental data, we built a model of gap gene expression that could be fitted to experimental data using parameter optimization techniques. We identify structural and practical identifiability of the parameters and demonstrate the reliability of our results by fitting the same model to independent data sets. Our results suggest that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for the correct patterning of gap genes in Drosophila embryos.
In this study, the authors investigated the role of the innate immune system in the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. They found that the expression of the Toll-like receptor 3 ( TLR3 ), which is important for recognizing dsRNA molecules, is upregulated in the intestinal epithelium of neonatal mice compared to adults. In contrast, the expression of TLR7 was unchanged, while the expression of the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 ( RIG1 ) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 ( MDA5 ) were increased in the intestinal epithelium of neonatal mice compared to adults. The authors also found that the expression of the type I interferon-inducible genes interferon-beta ( IFN-β ) and interferon-lambda 2/3 ( IFN-λ2/3 ) was higher in neonatal mice than in adults. They further showed that Trif-deficient mice had higher viral shedding and lower epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes compared to wild-type mice. The authors suggest that age-dependent changes in innate immune signaling contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection.
The paper "Large-Scale Analysis of Autism Spectrum Disorders Associated Rare Variants" reports the findings of a genome-wide analysis of rare variants associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The analysis involved whole-exome sequencing of 1,039 individuals with ASD and 870 controls, selected to be of similar ancestry. The study aimed to investigate whether the power of rare variant analysis could be improved by combining data from multiple centers and sequencing platforms. The analysis found that mega-analysis, which involves combining all the data together for analysis, had greater power than meta-analysis, which involves combining p-values from each center separately. The study also found that principal component analysis (PCA) was effective in correcting for population structure in the analysis. Overall, the study suggests that combining data from multiple centers and sequencing platforms can improve the power of rare variant analysis for ASD.
Madurella mycetomatis is a fungus that causes a rare disease called eumycetoma in humans. This disease is characterized by the formation of grains. Many people are exposed to this fungus, but only a small number develop the disease. The fungus has chitin in its cell wall, which can trigger the immune system. Some people have genetic polymorphisms that affect their ability to fight against this fungus. In this study, researchers looked at four genetic polymorphisms that affect chitinase activity in people with eumycetoma caused by M. mycetomatis. They found that a polymorphism that results in decreased chitotriosidase activity was associated with an increased risk of eumycetoma. No association was found for the polymorphisms in the genes for AMCase. The researchers believe that their findings could help in the development of new treatments for eumycetoma caused by M. mycetomatis.
Researchers have discovered that HSV-1, a herpesvirus that causes cold sores and other infections, has a more complex life cycle than previously thought. It was found that HSV-1 can persist in the body in a dormant state, and that it can reactivate at any time. This discovery has important implications for the treatment and prevention of HSV-1 infections.
The present study aimed to compare the cellular association of PrPSc from three different mouse-adapted scrapie strains with astroglia and neurons in the thalamus during early disease progression. For this purpose, we used dual-staining immunohistochemistry to compare PrPSc from 22L, RML, and ME7 strains with astroglial and neuronal markers in the thalamus at the onset of prion disease in mice. In addition, we used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to analyze the neuroinflammatory response associated with each strain. Our results show that PrPSc accumulation in the thalamus of mice infected with different strains of scrapie was associated with different cellular types. Surprisingly, despite differences in cell-association of PrPSc among the strains, all three strains had similar patterns of upregulation of genes associated with neuroinflammation. These data suggest that cellular association of PrPSc may not be an important determinant of the neuroinflammatory response in the thalamus during early stages of prion disease in mice.
This manuscript describes a new method for building coarse-grained null models for chromosomes that takes into account both the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density. The authors demonstrate that their method allows for efficient simulations of long chromosomes during an extended time period while maintaining the correct structural and dynamical properties. They then apply their method to investigate the role of epigenomic-driven interactions in the folding and dynamics of drosophila genome. The manuscript provides a detailed description of the methods and includes a lay summary of the provided content.
We used Bayesian regression to identify genome-wide significant cis-eQTLs in 11 studies. We then used LD-based allelic heterogeneity analysis to characterize cis-regulatory elements associated with eQTLs. Finally, we used multi-task Bayesian regression to identify regulatory elements associated with multiple eQTLs in different cell types.
In order to create stable cell lines that produce bnAb, we have used the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to knockout the gene for mannose receptor A (MRA) in the CHO-S cell line. This gene is responsible for the formation of Man5-type glycans, which are the target of the bnAb. The knockout was achieved using a plasmid containing the guide RNA sequence and the Cas9 protein, which are introduced into the cells using an electroporation method. The efficiency of the knockout was confirmed by DNA sequencing and western blotting. The cells were then transfected with a plasmid containing the gene sequence for gp120, a protein that makes up the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1. This protein was modified to express Man3-type glycans, which are also recognized by the bnAb. The resulting cell lines were tested for their ability to produce the bnAb and found to be stable and produce the bnAb at levels comparable to the parental line. The cells were also tested for their ability to produce other bnAbs and found to be stable and produce the bnAb at levels comparable to the parental line. Overall, this study demonstrates that the use of CRISPR/Cas9 technology can be used to create stable cell lines that produce bnAbs.
Tropical diseases such as filariasis and lymphatic filariasis are caused by nematodes, and are a major cause of disability and social and economic burden in developing countries. The causative nematodes, Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi, are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The molecular mechanisms underlying the action of anthelmintic drugs on these nematodes are poorly understood. We have identified a highly conserved mitochondrial HAD domain in the H. polymera parasite that binds to T6PP, a mitochondrial protein that plays a central role in the production of trehalose, a key component of the worm’s life cycle. We have determined the crystal structure of the complex between H. polymera T6PP and T6P, and have shown that the HAD domain binds to the phosphate group of T6P with a high affinity. We have also found that the drug albendazole targets the T6PP-T6P complex. Our results suggest that the HAD domain of T6PP may be a potential target for the development of new drugs against helminths.
We developed a computational framework that simulates vascular blood and interstitial fluid transport in whole tumours. The model is able to simulate spatially heterogeneous blood vessel architectures and, for the first time, takes into account the influence of vascular permeability on interstitial fluid transport. The model is able to accurately predict interstitial fluid flow in vivo, which is currently difficult to achieve with conventional experimental techniques.
The study highlights the importance of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and entry inhibitors in preventing HIV-1 infection during cell-cell transmission. The study shows that the neutralization activity of nAbs is significantly diminished during cell-cell transmission, but can be restored by including polycationic compounds in the medium, which allow cell-cell transmission to occur in the absence of free virus. The study also demonstrates the importance of inhibitors in preventing cell-cell transmission and shows that the activity of entry inhibitors is dependent on the mode of transmission. The study provides insights into the mechanism of cell-cell transmission and the role of neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors in preventing infection during cell-cell transmission.
This paper presents a simple mechanistic model that explains how a top-down attentional signal modulates visual responses in higher areas of the visual hierarchy. The model proposes that attentional modulation arises from feedforward connections from lower areas and feedback connections from higher areas. The model is implemented as a reciprocally connected square lattice of cells with short-range lateral inhibition. The attentional signal modifies the feedforward and feedback connections between cells, leading to shifts in RF position and size, as well as biased competition between neighboring cells. The model successfully reproduces the attentional effects on response rates and receptive field structure that have been observed in both visual areas V1 and V4.
The posterior signaling center (PSC) controls hematopoietic progenitor (hemocyte) homeostasis in the Drosophila larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway is involved in this process, and the receptor Latran (Lat) acts as a negative regulator of this pathway.
The study is about the patterns of recombination that occur during infections of plants with two viruses from the same family and how they can be influenced by the evolutionary history of the viruses. The authors discovered that recombinant viruses sampled from natural infections have non-random patterns of recombination that are consistent with the existence of selection acting to maintain some of the existing interactions in the parental viruses. This selection could be acting to maintain the stability of the viral genomes or the encoded proteins. The study provides important insights into how recombination can influence the evolution of viruses.
In this article, the authors explore the relationship between nucleosomes and sequence evolution. Nucleosomes, which are the basic repeat units of eukaryotic chromatin, are believed to play an important role in regulating gene expression and other cellular processes. The authors suggest that nucleosomes may also influence the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, both by altering the propensity of DNA to mutate and by selection acting to maintain or exclude nucleosomes in particular locations. They find that despite some differences in the way that nucleosomes are assembled in humans and the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii, the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution is remarkably conserved between the two kingdoms. The authors then examine whether selection or mutation can explain this association and find that neither model is sufficient to explain the observed patterns. Instead, they suggest that nucleosome repositioning is both necessary and largely sufficient to explain the relationship between current nucleosome positions and biased substitution patterns.
We propose a procedure to identify key positions in a protein that are dynamically important for its function. These key positions are identified by analyzing normal modes associated to the conformational change upon ligand binding. We find that key positions are mostly buried aliphatic residues localized in well-structured regions of the protein such as β-sheets and α-helices.
The article is about the role of the enzyme fructose-1 , 6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ). The authors of the article used a special genetic switch to control the expression of FBA in Mtb and found that FBA is essential for the survival of Mtb in both the acute and chronic phases of infection in mice. They also found that FBA is essential for the growth of Mtb on single carbon sources, but not on mixtures of carbon sources. To study the role of FBA in Mtb, the authors used a conditional fba knockout ( Δfba ) Mtb strain that can express FBA in response to anhydrotetracycline (atc). They found that Mtb lacking FBA can only grow on mixtures of glucose and butyrate, and that this growth is dependent on the ability of Mtb to co-catabolize glucose and butyrate. The authors also studied the role of FBA in the survival of Mtb in vivo by using a fba knockout ( Δfba ) Mtb strain and a fba complemented ( Δfba +fba ) Mtb strain. They found that Mtb lacking FBA can survive in the lungs of mice, but that the survival of Mtb lacking FBA is reduced compared to Mtb expressing FBA. The authors also found that Mtb lacking FBA can survive in the spleens of mice, but that the survival of Mtb lacking FBA is reduced compared to Mtb expressing FBA. Overall, the article provides important insights into the role of FBA in the survival and growth of Mtb, and may have implications for the development of new drugs to treat tuberculosis.
Two-cysteine peroxiredoxins, also known as TRXs, are redox-active proteins that play key roles in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the maintenance of redox homeostasis in living cells. In this study, the authors investigate the function of a two-cysteine peroxiredoxin, mTXNPx, which is found in the cytosol and mitochondria of Leishmania infantum promastigotes. They find that mTXNPx is essential for parasite survival and virulence in the mammalian host, but that it can be replaced by the mammalian TRX, TRX1, in the mitochondria. The authors also suggest that mTXNPx has a chaperone-like function that is required for the maintenance of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) integrity in the promastigote stage of the parasite's life cycle.
The Histoplasma urine antigen (HUAg) test is a way to diagnose progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) in HIV patients. This test is commonly used in the United States, but not in Mexico. In 2007, a new version of the HUAg test was approved for clinical use, but it is considered less accurate than the original version. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy of the new HUAg test for diagnosing PDH in HIV patients in Mexico. We conducted a prospective study in seven hospitals, including 295 patients. The results of the study showed that the new HUAg test had a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 97%, which means that it is not as accurate as the original version. Despite this, it may still be useful for diagnosing PDH in HIV patients, especially in regions without access to the original version of the test.
In this study, the authors used a "micro-mass sequencing" approach to characterize the eukaryotic viral communities present in diarrhea specimens from 12 children. They detected known enteric viruses, as well as multiple sequences from putatively novel viruses with only limited sequence similarity to viruses in GenBank. The authors' findings provide evidence for the detection of known and novel viruses during episodes of diarrhea and highlight the potential of metagenomic sequencing to identify previously unrecognized etiologic agents of diarrheal disease.
The Zika virus and the dengue virus are both spread by the same type of mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Both viruses cause significant health problems, but the Zika virus causes a rare condition called microcephaly in babies. Researchers looked at how the two viruses spread in the Dominican Republic. They found that the Zika virus spread more widely among women than men. Women were also more likely to get sick than men. However, there is evidence that men are more likely to get Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare condition that affects the nervous system. The study also looked at how the reproductive number, a measure of how many people each person with the virus infects, is different for the two viruses. The reproductive number was higher for Zika than for dengue. The researchers recommend that media campaigns and screening be done for women during Zika outbreaks to help reduce the spread of the virus.
The Arabidopsis genome encodes three PARP proteins that carry a PARP signature motif, as well as RCD1 and five SRO ( “Similar to RCD One” ) proteins with a variant form of the PARP signature. The product of the Arabidopsis At2g31320 gene ( NCBI NP_850165.1 ) is herein called PARP1, and the Arabidopsis At4g02390 product ( NCBI NP_192148.2 ) is PARP2. The Arabidopsis parp1-1 and parp1-2 mutants are fertile but exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging chemicals and to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae . The Arabidopsis parp2 mutants are fertile and exhibit a mild DNA damage sensitivity, but have a more robust defense against Pseudomonas syringae infection and are less sensitive to DNA damaging chemicals . The Arabidopsis parg1 and parg2 mutants exhibit normal growth but increased sensitivity to DNA damaging chemicals and the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae infection. However, the parg1 mutants have more severe phenotypes in terms of growth, development and flowering time, and are less sensitive to DNA damaging chemicals and Pseudomonas syringae infection than the parg2 mutants. The expression of Arabidopsis PARP1/2 and PARG1/2 was observed under normal conditions and after exposure to DNA-damaging chemicals, the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae infection, or ionizing radiation. The subcellular localization of PARP1/2 and PARG1/2 proteins was examined in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing C-terminal fusions to GFP. The results revealed that PARP1/2 and PARG1/2 proteins are predominantly localized in the nucleus under normal conditions. However, after exposure to DNA-damaging chemicals, the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae infection, or ionizing radiation, PARP1/2 proteins were observed to accumulate in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, while PARG1/2 proteins were observed to accumulate in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. This suggests that PARP1/2 and PARG1/2 proteins may play different roles in response to different types of stress.
The article "A New MAPK Signaling Pathway Regulates Presynaptic Branching in Mechanosensory Neurons" by the authors S. M. Trudeau et al. presents a study on the development of glutamatergic synapses in C. elegans. The authors discovered a new MAPK signaling pathway that regulates presynaptic branching in mechanosensory neurons. The pathway consists of MIG-15, NSY-1, JNK-1, and JKK-1 and acts as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1. The authors also used behavioral assays to show that the pathway regulates short-term learning. Their findings provide insights into the mechanisms of presynaptic branching and synaptic development.
Researchers have identified a new bipotential transcription factor called TRR-1 that controls the development of sperm and oocytes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis briggsae. The discovery suggests that the sex-determination switch in this species can evolve rapidly over short periods of time. This study has important implications for our understanding of how the sex-determination system works in different species of worms, as well as for our understanding of how the switch can evolve over time.
Integrated Information is a measure of the information that a system generates beyond the sum of its individual parts. It is defined as the reduction of entropy that occurs when a system transitions between states. Integrated information is important because it may reflect levels of consciousness generated by neural systems. However, the previous definition of integrated information is only applicable to discrete Markovian systems, which are uncommon in biology. In this paper, we present new measures of integrated information, called integrated information empirical (ΦE) and integrated information auto-regressive (ΦAR), that are practical for time-series data and are applicable to continuous or discrete systems, Markovian or otherwise. These measures can help examine information integration in real and model systems, and provide insights into the relationships between integrated information, consciousness, and other neurocognitive processes.
Rhodesian HAT ( Trypanosoma rhodesiense ) is a deadly disease caused by sleeping sickness parasites that affect humans and animals. It is endemic in Uganda's eastern and northern regions. A new approach to modelling the spatial distribution of HAT is presented in this article. The approach is based on spatial generalized linear models and Bayesian inference, and it incorporates spatial autocorrelation. The model was applied to a dataset of Rhodesian HAT cases and environmental, climatic, and social variables. The results showed that the movement of untreated, infected livestock was associated with the spread of HAT into the affected districts. This study provides a rigorous analytical approach for identifying the factors that influence the spatial distribution of Rhodesian HAT, which can be used to inform disease control efforts.
The paper challenges the long-held belief that the "complexity begets stability" principle applies to ecosystems. The authors argue that this assumption, which was made decades ago, has not been tested and may not be valid. They provide analytical results and simulations that show that the probability of a system being stable decreases as the number of species in the system increases. The authors also show that the stability of the system depends on the strength and intensity of the interactions between species, as well as on the structure of the network. They conclude that a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between these factors.
Q fever is a disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. It is an infectious disease that affects both humans and animals, particularly cattle and sheep. This study was conducted in Western Kenya to assess the seroprevalence of Q fever in humans and cattle and determine the socio-economic, demographic and environmental factors correlated with exposure in humans and cattle. A cross-sectional survey was conducted, and the study area was selected to represent the Lake Victoria basin ecosystem with a predominantly crop-livestock production system. A total of 1365 cattle and 416 households were included in the study. Seropositivity was assessed using antibody ELISA methods. Questionnaires were administered to collect information on household, individual human, and individual cattle level factors. Covariate datasets were obtained to provide information on a range of external factors thought to be relevant for C . burnetii exposure. Spatial analysis was carried out to assess the spatial patterns of seropositivity in humans and cattle. The results suggest that cattle obtained from market and those residing in areas with lower precipitation levels have the highest sero-prevalence. For humans , the youngest age group had the highest odds of seropositivity, and variations were observed between ethnic groups. Frequent livestock contact ( specifically grazing and dealing with abortion material ) was also a risk factor. These results illustrate endemicity of C . burnetii in western Kenya , although prevalence is relatively low. The analysis indicates that while environmental factors may play a role in cattle exposure patterns , human exposure patterns are likely to be driven more strongly by livestock contacts. The implication of livestock markets in cattle exposure risks suggests these may be a suitable target for interventions.
This manuscript describes the identification and characterization of three novel genes encoding DEAD-box RNA helicases in the schistosome S. mansoni. These genes are predicted to be involved in processes such as transcription, translation, and ribosomal biogenesis, and may be useful as markers for germline cells in schistosomes. The authors use multiple approaches to characterize these genes, including phylogenetic analysis, gene structure analysis, and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to determine expression patterns. They also perform whole mount in situ hybridization to visualize the expression of these genes in different developmental stages of S. mansoni. Overall, this work provides important insights into the structure and function of DEAD-box RNA helicases in schistosomes and may have implications for the development of new diagnostic or therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis.
The Hippo signaling pathway helps regulate tissue growth, homeostasis, and organ size. In this study, researchers found that the transcription cofactor VGLL4 was expressed in heart valve interstitial cells and was important for heart valve development and homeostasis. They discovered that loss of VGLL4 in endothelial lineage led to valve malformation, but loss of VGLL4 in neural crest lineage did not affect valve development. They also found that VGLL4 regulated Hippo components and that loss of VGLL4 led to hyperproliferation of valve interstitial cells. These findings suggest that manipulating the Hippo pathway could be a potential therapy for preventing the progression of congenital valve disease.
Recently, there has been a lot of excitement over the evidence that natural selection is acting on standing variation in humans, great apes, and other species. However, it is not clear how much of this variation is actually neutral and how much is beneficial. In this study, we examined the evidence for selective sweeps on standing variation using the statistic H-statistics, which looks at how segregating sites at a locus change over time. We simulated genetic data and looked at how well H-statistics can distinguish between different types of evolutionary events. Our results show that H-statistics is not a very reliable way to distinguish between different types of evolutionary events. We also looked at how well H-statistics can distinguish between populations with different demographic histories. We found that H-statistics is not very reliable at this either. Finally, we looked at how well H-statistics can distinguish between populations with different selection pressures. We found that H-statistics is not very reliable at this either. Overall, our results suggest that H-statistics is not a very reliable way to identify selective sweeps on standing variation.
We identified four new npylr1s in Ae. aegypti and investigated their roles in the host-seeking behavior of mosquitoes. We show that only npylr1A is required for host-seeking behavior, and that it is regulated by Head Peptide-I, a pheromone that modulates mosquito behavior. We also show that NPYLR1 is not required for feeding or oviposition. We found that all four npylr1s are expressed at low levels in adult mosquitoes, suggesting that other receptors may also play a role in host-seeking behavior.
This study aimed at generating a predictive risk model for schistosomiasis at a local level by analyzing satellite-derived environmental data using different techniques. Environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, elevation, land use, slope, drainage, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and building density were reclassified and standardized into four levels of risk, namely very low, low, moderate, and high risk. These risk factors were then weighted using a pairwise comparison method to derive the mapping weight or importance of each individual schistosomiasis risk factor. The weighted overlay analysis in ArcGIS was used to generate the schistosomiasis risk zones. Buildings were geocoded and selected for urine collection. House-to-house sample collection was preceded by an interactive meeting of the researcher and village heads to explain the purpose of the survey. Each participant was given a clean 50cm3 wide-mouthed, screw-capped specimen bottles to supply terminal urine produced between 10:00am and 2:00pm. The samples were preserved on collection by adding 5ml of 10% formalin at the point of collection and carried to the laboratory. In the laboratory, each sample bottle was agitated to suspend the ova evenly in urine, and 10ml of the urine was transferred with a sterile disposable syringe to a centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1500rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the sediment was transferred onto a microscope slide. A drop of Lugol’s iodine was added and neatly covered with a cover slip. The slide was examined under the microscope for eggs of S . haematobium. When present, the individual was classified as positive for schistosomiasis. Chi-square statistical analysis was used to test for significant difference between communities and prevalence of infection.
This study found that the delta6 mutant of pneumolysin, which cannot form pores, did not produce any significant changes in the neocortex of infected mice. However, wild-type pneumolysin caused significant dendritic spine loss and synaptic number reduction in the neocortex. These effects were dependent on the pore-forming activity of pneumolysin and could be blocked by pore-blocking drugs. The study also found that pneumolysin caused dendritic spine loss and synaptic number reduction in primary mouse astrocytes in vitro, and this effect was also dependent on the pore-forming activity of pneumolysin. These findings suggest that the pore-forming activity of pneumolysin plays an important role in causing neocortical damage in meningitis.
Papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of viruses that can cause cancer. They need to infect cells that are dividing, and this happens in the basal layer of the skin. However, the reason for this is not well understood. In this study, researchers used infectious HPV particles to infect G1-synchronized human keratinocytes and found that the cells need to be in early M phase to be infected. The cells at early M phase are the ones that are best able to be infected, and this is because they are able to take up the virus particles. The researchers also found that mitosis is important for infection to occur. This study provides important information about the life cycle of HPVs and how they can infect cells. It can help to develop new ways to prevent HPV infections, which are important because HPV is a major risk factor for cancer.
The article "Discovering the Roles of MilRNAs in Fungal Dimorphism" explains the discovery of microRNA-like (miRNA) genes in the dimorphic fungus P. marneffei, which causes Penicilliosis in humans. Researchers have identified 24 potential milRNAs in this fungus and have shown that they are differentially expressed in the yeast and mycelial forms of the fungus. They have also generated knockout mutants of these miRNA genes and shown that they are involved in the regulation of fungal dimorphism. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying fungal dimorphism and has implications for the development of new drugs to treat penicilliosis.
In 2013, Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged in French Polynesia and spread throughout the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. Several potential Aedes mosquitoes may have contributed to the ZIKV transmission, including Aedes aegypti, the main arbovirus vector in the region, and Aedes polynesiensis, a vector of lymphatic filariasis and secondary vector of dengue virus. The aim of this study was to analyze the ability of these two Pacific vector populations to transmit ZIKV at a regional scale by evaluating and comparing the vector competence of wild Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis populations from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain that circulated in the region during the 2013–2017 outbreak. Three populations of Aedes aegypti from New Caledonia (West Pacific), Samoa (Center), and French Polynesia (East) were analyzed, as well as two populations of Aedes polynesiensis from Wallis (from the Territory of Wallis and Futuna Islands, Center) and Tahiti (French Polynesia, East). Female mosquitoes were exposed to ZIKV and analyzed at 6, 9, 14, and 21 days post-infection to measure infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. The results revealed a low vector competence of both species for ZIKV at a regional scale. The study suggests that other factors, such as vector density, mosquito lifespan, and large immunologically naive fractions of the population, may have contributed to the rapid spread of ZIKV in the Pacific region during the 2013–2017 outbreak. The results of this study have important implications for future ZIKV research and control efforts in the Pacific region.
The authors present Targeted Structure-Seq, a novel method for probing and sequencing RNA structures in mammalian cells. This approach uses chemical probing of RNA in vivo, followed by sequencing, to provide detailed information about RNA secondary structures in their natural context. The authors apply this approach to Xist, a long noncoding RNA that is critical for proper dosage of imprinted genes. They find that the repeat A region of Xist is structured in cells, and identify new conserved structural elements in Xist, including a new evolutionarily conserved element near the C repeats that is important for Xist function. Overall, this study provides a powerful new tool for probing RNA structures in vivo and for studying their functions.
We present a new framework for the statistical analysis of genetic risk prediction models. The framework is based on the liability threshold model, which assumes an underlying liability that is normally distributed. We use this model to define a variety of indices for the evaluation of prediction models, including the area under the curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement, integrated discrimination improvement, and variance explained. We also derive graphs for visualizing the performance of risk models. These graphs include the ROC curve, predictiveness curve, and reclassification table. We use this framework to simulate the performance of a hypothetical genetic model for prostate cancer and compare it to a simulated perfect model. Our results show that the AUC is a useful metric for the evaluation of genetic risk prediction models, but it does not take into account the absolute risk of disease. We propose that the variance explained and discrimination slope should also be used to evaluate genetic risk prediction models. The variance explained measures the proportion of total variance in liability that is explained by the genetic marker, while the discrimination slope measures the difference in predicted risks between cases and non-cases. Our framework provides a unifying framework for the statistical analysis of genetic risk prediction models.
This study compares the accuracy of two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for detecting Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infections in passive and active screening. The RDT1 was previously validated in independent studies, while RDT2 is a new prototype test developed in a partnership with FIND. Both tests use recombinant antigens expressed in E. coli or baculovirus. A total of 57,632 individuals were screened in the DRC using the three screening tests, with 260 confirmed HAT cases. The sensitivity of RDT1 and RDT2 was 62.5% and 71.2%, respectively, with RDT2 being non-inferior to RDT1. Both tests had higher sensitivity in active than in passive screening. The specificity of RDT1 and RDT2 was 98.9% and 98.1%, respectively, with RDT2 being less specific than RDT1. Overall, the study suggests that RDT2 is as accurate as RDT1 for detecting T. brucei gambiense infections, but has lower specificity.
Chagas disease is a major health threat in Latin America, and Guatemala has been successful in controlling it. However, there are still some areas with persistent infestations, including the municipality of Comapa in Jutiapa Department. We evaluated the effects of the Chagas control program on infestation and human seroprevalence in Comapa, using three cross-sectional entomological and serological surveys spanning a 15-year period. We found that after multiple rounds of IRS interventions, the infestation index decreased significantly from 39% to 27%. However, seroprevalence in women of child-bearing age remains >10%, which poses a threat to the 2022 Chagas disease elimination goal. We also found that vector-borne transmission is a major risk factor for persistent infestation, especially at higher altitudes. Our study highlights the need for integrated vector control and improved Chagas disease screening and treatment programs for congenital and vector-borne disease to reach the elimination goal in regions with persistent vector infestation.
This article describes a study on the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium, a model organism for understanding the pathogenesis of enteric bacteria. The authors sequenced the genomes of multiple C. rodentium isolates and identified differences between them. They found evidence of genomic rearrangements, including deletions, insertions, and duplications, that may have contributed to the virulence of the organism. The authors also identified differences in the expression of genes involved in the regulation of virulence factors, suggesting that these factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of C. rodentium.
The article you provided is a scientific paper called "Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression underlie distributions of protein levels across cell populations." The paper proposes a method for inferring the molecular mechanisms that underlie the shape of protein distributions in a population of cells from stochasticity in protein expression. The method involves deriving analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution, finding that these four moments completely capture the shape of protein distributions, and developing an efficient algorithm for inferring gene expression rate constants from the moments of protein distributions. The authors test the algorithm and find that it can identify most protein distributions as a large number of different biochemical rate constant sets. The paper provides a detailed mathematical framework for understanding stochastic fluctuations in gene expression and their impact on protein distribution.
Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is a rare but serious disease that can cause fever, rash, swollen lymph nodes, and respiratory problems. Scientists have been working to develop a vaccine against MPXV, which is a member of the orthopoxvirus family of viruses. A recent study published in PLOS ONE describes the development of a vaccine against MPXV using a modified version of the vaccinia virus (MVA). The MVA vaccine was tested in mice, and the results showed that it was effective in protecting against MPXV infection.
Trypanosomes are flagellated protozoans that are the causative agents of several parasitic diseases affecting humans and livestock. The removal of unnecessary introns is a crucial step in the maturation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in eukaryotic cells, and is catalyzed by the decapping enzyme DCP2. However, in trypanosomes, DCP2 and other decapping enzymes are absent, and this species has evolved a novel mechanism for mRNA decapping. In this paper, the authors identify a new protein, ALPH1, which is necessary for the release of m7G from the 5' end of mRNA. The authors demonstrate that ALPH1 can sensitize a capped RNA to the ribonuclease Xrn1 in the presence of a 5' polyphosphatase. They also show that ALPH1 localizes to a specific granule at the posterior pole of the cell, which contains the Xrn1 ribonuclease. The authors propose that ALPH1 may be the missing decapping enzyme in trypanosomes.
The study presents research on converting adult alpha cells in the pancreas to beta-like cells through the use of gene expression. The study used a combination of conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches to show that the selective inhibition of the Arx gene in alpha cells promotes the conversion of adult alpha cells into beta-like cells at any age. The study also showed that this conversion induces the continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine cell fate. The study suggests that Arx represents the main trigger of alpha cell-mediated beta-like cell neogenesis. Additionally, the study shows that the loss of Arx in alpha cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional beta-cell mass and reverse diabetes following toxin-induced beta-cell depletion. Overall, the study suggests that strategies aiming at inhibiting the expression of Arx or its molecular targets/co-factors may pave new avenues for the treatment of diabetes.
In this study, we examine the replication of specific yeast origins of replication in the absence of the Sir2 and Fkh1 proteins. We find that the replication of some origins is promoted while others are inhibited in the absence of these proteins. We also find that the Sir2 and Fkh1 proteins act in a non-local manner and promote the efficient replication of origins throughout the genome.
Entamoeba histolytica is a parasite that causes a potentially life-threatening disease in humans. The disease can spread through ingestion of contaminated food or water, or through sexual contact. HIV-1-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk of amebic diseases. In this study, we examined the clinical features and epidemiology of amebic diseases in HIV-1-infected Japanese patients. The patients were diagnosed with amebic diseases based on various criteria, including PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing. The study found that clinical presentation of amebic diseases in HIV-1-infected patients was similar to that in the normal host. High fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP (C-reactive protein) were associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. The study also examined the efficacy of metronidazole and tinidazole treatment, as well as luminal treatment, in preventing recurrence of amebic diseases. The results suggest that luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment does not reduce the recurrence of amebic diseases in high-risk populations, such as HIV-1-infected men who have sex with men. This may be due to amebic re-infection. The study highlights the importance of ongoing research to better understand the causes and treatment of amebic diseases, particularly in high-risk populations.
This study aimed to evaluate the impact of tsetse control using tiny targets on the incidence of Gambian sleeping sickness (HAT) in Mandoul, Chad. The study was conducted in three phases: a pre-intervention survey to assess the baseline distribution of tsetse; an entomological intervention to reduce the population of tsetse using tiny targets; and a post-intervention survey to assess the impact of tsetse control on the population of tsetse and the incidence of HAT. The pre-intervention survey revealed that the vector is Glossina fuscipes fuscipes, with a mean catch of tsetse from traps of 0.7 flies/trap/day. After tsetse control commenced, the mean catch declined to 0.005 flies/trap/day, indicating a reduction in the tsetse population. Mathematical modelling was used to assess the impact of vector control on HAT incidence, showing that 70.4% of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 can be attributed to vector control, with the rest due to medical intervention. The study suggests that tiny targets have contributed to a substantial reduction in tsetse populations in the Mandoul focus, which may have interrupted transmission and contributed to a significant reduction in the incidence of HAT.
This study is about imported strongyloidiasis in Spain. It is a type of parasite that can live inside a person's body for a long time without being reinfected, and it causes a variety of problems. The study included 1,245 cases of imported strongyloidiasis from 2009 to 2017 in Spain. Most of the patients were immigrants, and the most common area of origin was South America. The parasite was diagnosed through various methods, including stool samples, serology tests, and other medical tests. The study found that the most strongly associated factor for achieving a cure was treatment with ivermectin compared to albendazole. The study recommends that screening for S . stercoralis infection should be mandatory in patients coming from or traveling to endemic areas, especially in those with immunosuppressant conditions. The study also found that immunosuppressive conditions were associated with a higher rate of severe presentation.
In this study, the authors proposed a framework that uses mathematical models and experimental data to determine the optimal inoculum dose for vaccines. They illustrated their framework using data from two infection experiments with influenza A virus (IAV) in mice and human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) in cotton rats at different inoculum doses. They used the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity, and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. Their findings suggest that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. The authors concluded that their proposed framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and the determination of the optimal amount of inoculum, which can significantly contribute toward better vaccine design.
In this study, the authors investigate the gene expression of HetR, a protein that is essential for differentiation of nitrogen-fixing heterocysts in the cyanobacterium Anabaena. They use a chromosomally-encoded translational hetR-gfp fusion to study the fluctuations of hetR expression and their distribution along filaments of Anabaena. The authors found that under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal, steady-state expression of the HetR inhibitor PatS, cell-cell communication influenced by the septal protein SepJ, and positive HetR auto-regulation are all important determinants of fluctuations in hetR expression and its distribution along filaments. They also found that under nitrogen-poor conditions, the inhibitors PatS and HetN have different effects on hetR expression, and that the septal proteins FraC/FraD and SepJ are involved in the formation of the heterocyst pattern. Overall, the authors found that fluctuations in hetR expression play a key role in determining the developmental pattern of heterocysts in Anabaena.
Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a serious disease caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). There are two different genotypes of JEV, GI and GIII. Recent studies have shown that GI is becoming more dominant than GIII in China. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the reasons for this genotype shift by comparing the replication efficiency of GI and GIII strains in vitro and in vivo. They found that GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII strains in avian cells, which could lead to increased exposure and infection in mosquitoes and a higher transmission efficiency in the birds-mosquitoes-birds enzootic transmission cycle. This could, in turn, contribute to the JEV genotype shift.
We report on the use of systematic genetic interaction analysis to uncover new insights into the function of a transcriptional network that regulates biofilm formation in Candida albicans, a fungal pathogen. By constructing and analyzing double heterozygous mutants of six network genes, we found that the network is highly sensitive to genetic perturbation, showing haploinsufficiency for all six genes. We also found that many double heterozygous mutants are as severely affected as homozygous deletions, indicating that the network is highly interdependent and functions as a small-world network. By examining individual double heterozygous mutants, we discovered that TEC1 is highly sensitive to perturbations in other network TFs, and that expression of ROB1 is dependent on both auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other network TFs. We also found that the ndt80Δ/NDT80 mutant is hyperfilamentous in a TEC1-dependent manner. Our work provides new insights into the function of this transcriptional network, and highlights the utility of genetic interaction analysis in C. albicans.
This article presents a detailed study of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) from Leishmania major, a protozoan parasite causing cutaneous leishmaniasis. The authors conducted extensive molecular and biochemical studies to understand the enzyme's functional and structural properties. They found that LmAST has high levels of activity, which is essential for the parasite's survival and growth in the host environment. The authors also analyzed the enzyme's substrate specificity and kinetic properties, providing insights into its role in metabolic processes within the parasite. Additionally, the authors conducted a structural study of LmAST using computational methods and compared it to the structures of ASTs from other organisms. These studies provide valuable information about the enzyme's structure and function, which can be useful for developing new drugs to treat cutaneous leishmaniasis.
Toxocariasis is an infection caused by the nematode Toxocara spp. and is common worldwide. It is usually transmitted through direct contact with dogs or cats or by ingesting contaminated soil or water. Toxocara larvae can migrate to the brain and other organs, causing various neurological symptoms including seizures. In this study, the authors updated their previous meta-analysis on the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy. They found that there is a positive association between toxocariasis and epilepsy. The study also looked at potential sources of heterogeneity in the data and found that there was no significant association between covariates and the outcome. The authors conclude that there is epidemiological evidence of a positive association between toxocara-associated epileptogenesis and epilepsy.
The present study describes a new ATM-dependent pathway in which miR-335 downregulates CtIP protein levels, leading to radiosensitivity and reduced DSB repair efficiency. The authors show that CREB is responsible for a large portion of miR-335 expression and that CREB binding to the MEST promoter is reduced after IR, corroborating previous studies that IR-activated ATM phosphorylates CREB to reduce its transcription activity. Overexpression of miR-335 in HeLa cells resulted in reduced CtIP levels and post-IR colony survival and BRCA1 foci formation. Further, in two patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with decreased post-IR colony survival, a "radiosensitive" phenotype, elevated miR-335 expression, reduced CtIP levels, and reduced BRCA1 foci formation were demonstrated. Colony survival, BRCA1 foci, and CtIP levels were partially rescued by miRNA antisense AMO-miR-335 treatment. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that an ATM–dependent CREB–miR-335–CtIP axis influences the selection of HRR for repair of certain DSB lesions.
In this paper, the authors explore the role of mentalizing, or attributing mental states to others, in learning during social interactions. They use Bayesian models of mentalizing to compare the performance of participants playing a repeated game against artificial agents with different levels of mentalizing sophistication. The authors find that participants win against artificial agents with high mentalizing sophistication when playing in a social context, and that the choice sequences of participants are best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian learning models only in the social context. The study suggests that mentalizing is an important aspect of social cognition and is valuable in decision-making during social interactions.
Biological networks are important in understanding biological processes. However, traditional statistical methods do not work well for networks with many variables, like in biological data. Gaussian graphical model (GGM) is a statistical model that describes the conditional dependence structure of a set of random variables by a graph. The FastGGM algorithm was developed to efficiently implement the method proposed by Ren et al. to construct Gaussian graphical model and make inference with high-dimensional biological data. The algorithm is faster than the current implemented algorithm for Ren et al., without losing any accuracy. The algorithm has been implemented in an R package named “FastGGM”.
This paper investigates how changes in the inhibitory input to a single cell in a network of spiny neurons affect the network's dynamics. The authors use a mathematical model to simulate the behavior of the network and find that increasing the inhibitory input to a cell causes the network to become less synchronous, which is in agreement with experimental observations. The authors also find that the network becomes more sensitive to changes in the firing rate of individual cells, which they explain as being due to the fact that increasing the inhibitory input to a cell causes the network to become more heterogeneous. Finally, the authors show that increasing the inhibitory input to a cell causes the network to become more active, which they explain as being due to the fact that increasing the inhibitory input to a cell causes the network to become more excitable. Overall, this paper provides important insights into how changes in the inhibitory input to a cell in a network of spiny neurons affect the network's dynamics.
This paper investigates the role of Sec4p in polarized exocytosis and endocytosis in yeast. The authors used live cell imaging and particle tracking to study the movement of Sec4p and other proteins to and from the plasma membrane. They found that Sec4p polarization is required for actin patch assembly during endocytosis and that it regulates the actin polymerization required for endocytosis. The authors also found that Sec4p is involved in polarized exocytosis and that it regulates the actin polymerization required for exocytosis. Overall, this paper provides new insights into the role of Sec4p in polarized exocytosis and endocytosis in yeast.
This paper introduces a new method called Mouse Analog, which is a virtual lab that can be used to model acetaminophen (APAP) liver injury. Mouse Analog is built on a virtual lab toolkit called Liver, which can be used to model the spatial and temporal distribution of the metabolites of APAP in the liver. Mouse Analog can be used to test new hypotheses about the mechanisms of APAP liver injury.
In this study, we looked at 51 babies born to mothers who were infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. We wanted to find out how much of the parasite was in their blood and how this changed over the course of one year. We used a special type of PCR to measure the levels of the parasite in the babies' blood at 1, 6, and 12 months after birth. We also looked at the babies' antibody levels to see if these levels changed over time. The results showed that the parasite burden in some babies was very low, and that it was difficult to detect the parasite in their blood. We also found that there was a strong correlation between the babies' antibody levels and their parasite burden. Finally, we found that the parasite was more likely to be found in babies born to mothers who were infected with the TcV parasite. This information could help doctors and scientists better understand how to diagnose and treat babies who are infected with T. cruzi.
The authors present a new model of the metabolism of Escherichia coli that takes into account the crowding effect of the macromolecules. They consider a set of five steady-state equations of state that describe the dynamics of RNA polymerase (RNAp), ribosomes, and translation. The model incorporates feedback mechanisms that regulate the transcription and translation of RNAp and ribosomes. The authors show that the model is consistent with the observed WT cell state, and that the feedback mechanisms are sufficient to account for the dynamics of the system under different growth conditions. They also discuss the implications of the model for understanding the dynamics of RNAp and ribosomes in E. coli.
This article presents a detailed overview of MYB transcription factor RADIALIS/SQUAMOSA-LIKE (RSL) genes and their potential roles in Arabidopsis development. RSL genes are known for their functions in meristem maintenance, floral organ identity, and response to abiotic stress. The article explains the sequence similarities and phylogenetic relationships among RSL genes and provides a comprehensive overview of their genomic organization, expression patterns, and potential functions. Additionally, the article discusses the regulatory mechanisms governing RSL gene expression, including transcription factors and hormones, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying their functions.
Scientists from Germany, Denmark, and the United States have presented new data on the structure and function of mitochondrial complex I, which is an essential protein complex involved in energy production in cells. The team used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of complex I and found that it is made up of two main parts: a hydrophilic arm and a membrane arm. They also used blue-native electrophoresis (a technique that separates proteins based on their solubility in detergents) to analyze the subunit composition of the enzyme. This revealed that the membrane arm of complex I is composed of two subdomains: the proximal (PP) and distal (PD) domains. The team then performed experiments using a yeast strain that lacks a subunit of complex I to see how this affects the function of the enzyme. They found that the subcomplex still retains some proton-pumping activity, suggesting that there may be more than one proton-pumping site in the membrane arm of complex I. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the structure and function of mitochondrial complex I.
Fever is a natural response of the body to fight off infections, but it also plays a role in increasing the binding affinity between antibodies and antigens. This study found that the binding affinity between antibodies and antigens from dengue and malaria viruses was at its highest at a body temperature of 40°C. This suggests that fever is beneficial in enhancing the immune response to fight off these diseases.
The article describes a computational model of the actomyosin cortex in animal cells. This cortex is composed of thin layers of cross-linked actin filaments that are subject to force, generating macroscopic contractile stress. The authors use a simple coarse-grained description of these filaments, introducing effective drag forces between overlapping filaments and frictional forces between filament endpoints and the plasma membrane. They also include motor activity, represented as forces acting at the points where filaments overlap, and turnover, where filaments randomly appear and disappear. They use this model to study the passive and active responses of the cortex to external forces, the buildup and maintenance of contractile stress, and the resulting flows. Their results show that network remodeling can tune cortical flow through simultaneous effects on active force generation and passive resistance to network deformation.
Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) have identified a new gene, ANAC060, which regulates the sensitivity of Arabidopsis seedlings to high concentrations of glucose and fructose. They used a combination of genetic, molecular, and biochemical techniques to characterize the gene, which has a truncated protein due to a single-nucleotide polymorphism that causes an intron splicing defect in the Col-0 ecotype. The researchers showed that ANAC060 regulates sugar sensitivity through a negative feedback mechanism involving sugar-ABA signaling. They also showed that the Col-0 allele of ANAC060 is dominant over the C24 allele and that the dominant allele encodes a protein that is constitutively nuclear. The researchers concluded that their findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in sugar sensitivity and may have implications for understanding how plants respond to sugars and other signals in their environment.
This research paper describes the identification of new c-di-GMP signaling components in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The authors used a combination of phylogenetic analysis, bioinformatics, and molecular biology to identify and characterize new proteins that are involved in c-di-GMP signaling, including HsbD, HsbA, and HsbR. These proteins are involved in biofilm formation, motility, and other important biological processes. The authors also constructed mutant strains of P. aeruginosa to study the role of these proteins in c-di-GMP signaling and demonstrated the importance of c-di-GMP signaling in various biological processes.
In this study, researchers investigated whether visuomotor contingencies could be learned and stored for multiple shapes. Participants performed a two-target reaching task in which they had to point to one of two shapes while viewing a feedback that was shifted relative to the actual pointing position. They were trained on one of two shape-visuomotor contingencies and then tested on the other contingency. The results showed that participants could learn and store the visuomotor contingencies for multiple shapes.
The cerebellum uses climbing fiber (CF) signals to transmit information about sensory events, such as touch sensations on the skin, to Purkinje cells. These CF signals consist of a series of short bursts of spikes, and the size of these bursts has been thought to depend on the phase of the olivary cell's sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation. However, recent experimental findings using a detailed three-compartmental model of an inferior olivary cell show that the phase-dependency of the burst size is present but limited, and that charge flow between soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the climbing fiber burst. This suggests that phenomena such as cell ensemble synchrony can have a big effect on the climbing fiber burst size through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells. These findings have implications for the functioning of the cerebellum in motor control, as well as for machine learning approaches that use spike timing information to learn motor skills.
The article presents a mechanistic computational model of human liver iron metabolism. The model incorporates the core regulatory components of iron metabolism, including hepcidin, transferrin, ferritin, and ferroportin, and is based on known mechanisms of regulation and their kinetic properties. The model was validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data, and it was found to be able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. The model also provides a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in haemochromatosis, a disease caused by a mutation in the HFE gene. Overall, the model supports and supplements understanding of the role of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling and simulation.
The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a crucial structure in eukaryotic cells that allows for transport of molecules and proteins across the nuclear envelope. This process, known as nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT), is critical for regulating cellular function and maintaining the integrity of the cell. However, the mechanism of NCT is not fully understood and current models of the NPC do not provide a detailed explanation. To address this issue, a team of researchers has developed a coarse-grained model of the NPC that mimics the transport process. This model takes into account the hydrophobic interactions between karyopherins (KAPs) and phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domains, the polymeric nature of FG-repeats grafted on the elastic structure of the NPC, and the Kap-FG hydrophobic affinity. The model predicts that the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex is approximately 2.6 ms with an inverse Gaussian distribution for statistically adequate number of independent Brownian dynamics simulations. The cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall where it interacts with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel. The Kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring an efficient translocation through the NPC. Almost all eight hydrophobic binding spots on Kap-β are occupied simultaneously during transport. The team concludes that cytoplasmic filaments-deficient NPCs show a high degree of permeability to inert cargos, indicating the defining role of cytoplasmic filaments in the selectivity barrier.
Scientists have developed a new method for determining the dose of a pathogen that infects 50% of nonhuman primates in experiments. This method uses fewer animals and less resources than previous methods, and can estimate the dose within 1.5-fold of the true value. This new method can be applied to any infectious agent and animal model. The research supports the use of nonhuman primates to study human infectious diseases and vaccines.
We describe a study investigating how the auditory system of crickets adapts to the environment. Crickets have a unique auditory system with a single ascending neuron that responds to ultrasonic sounds. The study used two different stimuli: one with two peaks and one with three peaks. The researchers measured the response of the neuron to these stimuli and found that the response curve changed to better match the stimulus. This change in the response curve occurred after a 5-second adaptation period. The study also used multimodal stimuli with two or three peaks. The response curve changed in a way that matched the stimulus with the most intense peak, which was consistent with the selective coding hypothesis. However, the study also found that the response curve shifted to higher intensities, which was consistent with the infomax hypothesis. Overall, the study provides evidence that the auditory system of crickets adapts to the environment in a way that optimizes its ability to detect and respond to sounds.
In this study, the authors engineered PrPSc molecules lacking polybasic domains and studied their ability to dock and propagate prions. Using PrPSc molecules lacking these domains, the authors were able to dissect the relationship between the ability to seed formation of wild type PrPSc molecules in vitro and prion infectivity in vivo. They found that PrPSc molecules lacking polybasic domains are still capable of robust in vitro propagation but are not always associated with appropriate levels of specific infectivity. Their findings suggest that the role of polybasic domains in prion propagation may not be universally required and may vary depending on the specific PrPSc molecule. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of prion propagation and may have implications for the development of therapies to treat prion diseases.
The study presents a new computational framework for understanding the behavioral strategies used by animals to adapt to a changing environment. This framework is based on inverse reinforcement learning and involves estimating a value function for each state in the environment. The value function represents how beneficial each state is for the animal and is used to guide the animal's behavior towards the most beneficial state. The study applied this framework to understand the thermotactic behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of roundworm, under different conditions. The authors found that the worms used either directed or isothermal migration strategies, depending on their feeding status. They also showed that thermosensory neurons play a role in these strategies.
We report the draft genome assembly of Chrysochromulina tobin (Prymnesiophycidae: B2 clade), a haptophyte known for its mixotrophic lifestyle. Using a combination of Illumina and 454 sequencing, we generated a total of 3,000 contigs over 40 Mb. We also present transcriptomic data from 12 time points, allowing for the identification of differentially expressed genes. This work will provide a foundation for future studies on the metabolism, evolution, and ecology of this important marine alga.
This paper describes the tumor suppressor function of Rb, p53, and Brca1 in a mouse model of human breast cancer. The authors combine loss of Rb with loss of p53 and Brca1 to generate mice with features of aggressive human breast cancer, including rapid tumor progression, poor differentiation, distant metastasis, necrosis, metaplasia, and genomic instability. The study shows that the loss of each of these tumor suppressors contributes distinctly to the development of this aggressive breast cancer phenotype. The results highlight the importance of understanding the individual and combined functions of tumor suppressors in order to develop effective cancer therapies.
This study examined the ecology of Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue fever, in rural Thailand. The authors used data from 84,840 water-holding containers from 2004 to 2007 to develop a model that predicts the number of Ae. aegypti pupae in individual containers. The model included ecological factors such as habitat density, type of container, source of water, and coverage of the container. The authors found that high habitat density was associated with increased pupal production. They also found that certain container types, such as jars and tires, had a higher probability of being positive for pupae than other container types. The study provides valuable information for developing effective vector control strategies for dengue fever.
Understanding how animals integrate signals to make decisions is an important area of study in biology. One way that animals can make decisions is by sensing internal nutrient status and external signals such as temperature, pheromones, and food. Nutrient status is sensed by the intestine and communicates with other tissues, including neurons, to modulate the expression of genes involved in development and behavior. Using C. elegans as a model, this study finds that the intestinal TORC2 complex is important for integrating these signals and modulating the expression of genes involved in development and behavior. The authors find that intestinal TORC2 regulates the expression of genes involved in development and behavior through neuronal signaling. This work provides insights into how animals integrate signals from the intestine to make decisions.
This paper describes the use of genomic, computational, and experimental approaches to identify novel transcriptional regulatory sequences in pluripotent stem cells. The authors identified a set of genes that are upregulated in pluripotent stem cells and conserved across different mammalian species, and used these genes to identify motifs that are shared between different pluripotent cell types. The authors then used these motifs to generate reporter constructs that can be used to test their function in different cell types. They found that one of these motifs is conserved across different mammalian species, and that it is bound by the transcription factor NF-Y in mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. They also found that NF-Y is differentially expressed during differentiation of pluripotent stem cells, and that it is required for the proliferation of pluripotent stem cells. Overall, this paper provides important insights into the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that control pluripotent stem cell proliferation and differentiation.
In this study, the authors describe the reconstitution of a complex between a recombinant nucleoprotein (N) of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and a peptide encompassing the N0-binding MoRE of VSV phosphoprotein (P). The authors use size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and static light scattering (MALLS) to characterize the complex and demonstrate that it is a circular decamer of heterodimers, similar to the previously crystallized decameric N-RNA ring. The authors also show that the N0-binding MoRE of P binds to N in the NΔ210-P60 complex in solution as in the crystal structure and that the regions of P flanking this MoRE remain flexible in the complex. This study provides important insights into the chaperone activities of VSV P and the encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA.
The current study focused on understanding the role of gap junctions in the VS network of the blowfly. The VS network is responsible for processing visual input and directing behavioral responses. The study used a previously established mathematical model of the VS network to investigate the effects of gap junctions on its information processing capabilities. The results showed that the presence of gap junctions allowed the VS network to jointly encode different axes of rotation with better separability and reached near-optimal encoding efficiency. This efficient encoding was important for the fly's survival as it enabled the VS network to encode some basic rotations correctly, such as the up/down tilt of the head and body (pitch rotation). The study also demonstrated the importance of the axonal GJs in the VS network for the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries. The findings provide a deeper understanding of the role of gap junctions in the VS network and highlight their importance for efficient visual processing in the blowfly.
The article describes the research on the role of tyrosine sulfation in the binding of Enterovirus 71 (EV71) to its receptor, human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). The study found that tyrosine sulfation is important for PSGL-1-EV71 binding, and that blocking sulfation using the drug sodium chlorate inhibited EV71 infection in Jurkat T cells. The findings suggest that tyrosine sulfation plays a role in early virus-host interactions and pathogenesis of EV71.
Our study demonstrates that rapamycin and its analogs potently suppress the parasite burden in L. major-infected BALB/c mice. Rapamycin and its analogs suppress the proliferation of both the promastigote and amastigote forms of L. major, the latter of which is the pathogenic form of the parasite. Rapamycin also induces T helper type 1 (Th1) immune response and enhances the expression of several key genes in the Th1 pathway. We have identified the mechanisms through which rapamycin and its analogs suppress the parasite burden in L. major-infected mice and elucidated the immunomodulatory effects of these drugs in the host. Our findings provide new insights into the therapeutic potential of rapamycin and its analogs for the treatment of leishmaniasis.
Natural transformation is the process by which bacteria take up foreign DNA from their environment and incorporate it into their own genome. This process has been extensively studied in the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis, which uses natural transformation to acquire new virulence factors and other genetic material. The meningococcus has a unique mechanism for selecting the DNA it takes up for transformation. This process involves the DUS ( DNA uptake sequence) receptor ComP. The authors have shown that ComP is the receptor for DUS, a DNA sequence motif that is repeated 12 times and found in only 1% of the meningococcus genome. They have also shown that the recognition of DUS by ComP is dependent on the inner bases of the sequence, with single base mutations leading to impaired recognition. The authors have further shown that DUS variants naturally occurring in other Neisseria species are impaired for transformation in N. meningitidis, highlighting the importance of DUS conservation in this process. They have also shown that a ComP homolog from the related human pathogen N. gonorrhoeae can bind its cognate DUS, suggesting that this recognition mechanism is a widespread phenomenon in the Neisseriaceae family.
A recent study provides new insights into the mechanisms that regulate cytokinesis in the fission yeast S. pombe. The study shows that the binding of a scaffold protein, Pxl1, to the F-BAR domain of Cdc15 is required for the stable attachment of the ring to the plasma membrane. The study also demonstrates that Cdc15 and Bgs1 are essential for the formation of the septum and that they cooperate to maintain the ring in the middle of the cell during division. These findings provide important information about the mechanisms that control the formation of the cleavage furrow in the fission yeast and suggest that Pxl1 and Cdc15 are important for the coordination of the CAR and the septum synthesis during cell division.
In this article, researchers used two tools, multiple locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and whole genome sequencing (WGS), to investigate the genetic diversity and phylogeny of Burkholderia mallei (B. mallei), the bacterium that causes glanders disease in horses and humans. Glanders is a life-threatening disease that has reemerged in recent years, particularly in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. The researchers examined nine B. mallei isolates from horses and one isolate from a camel that were collected during a 2010-2011 glanders outbreak in Bahrain. They compared the Bahraini isolates to 15 isolates from a 2004 glanders outbreak in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Using MLVA, the researchers identified two distinct clusters of B. mallei that were involved in the 2010-2011 Bahrain outbreak. The clusters contained five and four strains each, respectively. This suggests that at least two different B. mallei populations caused the outbreak. The researchers also used WGS to analyze eight B. mallei genomes from the UAE outbreak and seven genomes from the Bahrain outbreak. The WGS data provided further evidence that the two populations of B. mallei involved in the 2010-2011 Bahrain outbreak were genetically distinct. This study demonstrates the usefulness of MLVA and WGS for understanding the genetic diversity and phylogeny of B. mallei and its role in glanders outbreaks. These tools can help researchers to track the spread of glanders disease and identify its sources.
American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is a complicated disease that causes about 67,000 new cases every year. The disease is caused by different species of Leishmania parasites, and it is difficult to determine which species is causing a particular case of ACL. The first-line treatment for ACL is pentavalent antimonials, such as Glucantime. However, the cure rate of Glucantime is only about 75%, and the reasons for treatment failure are not well understood. In order to better understand the clinical and parasitological features of patients with ACL who did not respond to Glucantime treatment, a cross-sectional observational study was conducted in Colombia. The study included 43 patients with ACL who were recruited from three national reference centers for complicated ACL. Clinical and paraclinical evaluations, as well as epidemiological and geographic information, were collected for each patient. Parasitological, histopathological, and PCR infection confirmation were also performed. Glucantime IC50 and in vitro infectivity for isolated parasites were estimated. The predominant infecting Leishmania species was L. braziliensis, and 35% of the parasites isolated showed a significant decrease in in vitro Glucantime susceptibility associated with previous administration of the medicament. Lesion size and in vitro infectivity of the parasite were negatively correlated with decline in Glucantime susceptibility. A negative correlation between lesion size and parasite resistance was also documented. L. braziliensis was found as the main parasite species associated with lesions of patients who underwent treatment failure or relapse. The indication of a second round of treatment in therapeutic failure of ACL produced by L. braziliensis with pentavalent antimonials is discussable.
This article describes a study that investigates the functional interchangeability of a 4'-phosphopantetheinyltransferase (PPTase) in the synthesis of various secondary metabolites in Escherichia coli. The study found that the ClbA PPTase encoded by the pks island can contribute to the synthesis of siderophores and colibactin in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that the strict association of the pks island with highly virulent E. coli strains could be due to the ClbA PPTase contributing to the synthesis of both colibactin and yersiniabactin. This study provides new insights into the interplay between various secondary metabolites and their biosynthetic pathways in E. coli.
Scientists have developed a new model to improve the accuracy of multiple sequence alignments, which are used to compare and understand the evolutionary relationships between different organisms. This model accounts for insertion and deletion events, in addition to residue substitutions, when aligning sequences. The model assumes that insertions and deletions occur one residue at a time. The model has been applied to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip, a widely used software for analyzing DNA sequences. The results of the study show that the extended program dnamlε improves accuracy while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm, which is used in the original version of dnaml. The scientists have also developed a non-reversible generative (birth–death) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions, which has been incorporated into the extended program dnamlε.
We have studied the mechanism of HSV infection in human skin, using explants of inner foreskin or biopsies from initial genital herpes lesions. In foreskin explants, LCs containing HSV or HSV antigen migrated into the dermis where they interacted with BDCA3+ dermal DCs forming clusters of cells. These clusters also contained CD14+, DC-SIGN+ dermal cells. In contrast, LCs did not interact with these two subsets of dermal DCs in genital lesions. When LCs were isolated from skin and infected with HSV-1 in vitro, they were taken up by BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ cells. These data show a unique pathogen driven interaction, resulting in a pathogen/antigen relay from human LCs to two different subsets of antigen presenting dermal cells/DCs, occurring within induced clusters of cells in the dermis, with likely different roles in stimulating different effector T cell subsets, either in lymph nodes or later, infiltrating the dermis. This is the first report of a human study that shows dermal DCs may play a key role in delivering and presenting viral antigens to T cells in the lymph nodes as well as possibly to residential T cells .
This study aimed to compare the formation of Leishmania amastigotes-hosting parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages. The study compared the PV formation in infected cells that were exposed to amastigotes of either Leishmania major or Leishmania amazonensis. Using multidimensional imaging of live cells, the authors compared and characterized the PV formation/remodeling of macrophages that were either infected with amastigotes of either L. major or L. amazonensis, or loaded with Lysotracker, a lysosomotropic fluorescent probe. The study revealed three dynamic features of Leishmania amastigote-hosting PVs. First, the entry of Lysotracker transients within tight-fitting, fission-prone L. major amastigote-housing PVs. Second, the decrease in the number of acidic vesicles of macrophages during the L. major PV fission or L. amazonensis PV enlargement. Third, the L. amazonensis PV remodeling after homotypic fusion. The high content information of multidimensional images provided an updated understanding of the Leishmania species-specific differences in PV biogenesis/remodeling and could be useful for the study of other intracellular microorganisms.
Homology-directed repair (HDR) is a process that allows for the repair of DNA lesions through the use of a template donor molecule. The current study uses the chicken B cell line DT40 as a model to study the role of donor chromatin structure in HDR. The authors found that the donors used in DT40 have active histone modifications, which is consistent with open chromatin structure. They then tethered the heterochromatin protein HP1 to the donor array in DT40 and found that this led to a transition of the donor sequences from an open to a nonpermissive state, as evidenced by a switch from templated to nontemplated diversification. These results demonstrate that permissive chromatin structure at the donor is a key regulator of HDR, and that nonpermissive chromatin structure can prevent homologous recombination and result in point mutagenesis. These findings have important implications for our understanding of homologous recombination and the mechanisms that promote LOH, leading to tumorigenesis and nonallelic recombination between repeats. They also have the potential to inform the design of donor constructs for targeted gene therapy.
The aim of this study was to explore whether the cerebellum can learn from visual errors during saccadic eye movements. To address this question, we recorded the activity of Purkinje cells (PCs) in the cerebellar cortex of monkeys performing a task in which they were required to make fast, accurate eye movements to a target that could either appear in the expected location or shift unexpectedly. We analyzed the activity of PCs during the movement and found that it was influenced by visual errors made in the previous trial. Specifically, we found that the activity of PCs increased when the target shifted unexpectedly during the previous trial, even though the PCs did not fire in response to the error itself. This suggests that the cerebellum can learn from visual errors and use this information to improve future performance.
In this study, the authors used the yeast model to investigate the toxicity of overexpressed human TDP-43 protein and to identify potential modifiers of TDP-43 toxicity. The authors found that TDP-43 toxicity was associated with an increase in cytosolic aggregates and a decrease in the ability of the UPS to degrade cytosolic misfolded proteins. The authors also found that excess Sis1 could reduce TDP-43 toxicity and restore UPS-mediated degradation. Furthermore, the authors found that DNAJB1, a mammalian Sis1 homologue, could reduce TDP-43 toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons. These findings suggest that Sis1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS.
Chagas disease is a serious health problem in Latin America, with an estimated 7 million people infected and 70 million people exposed. T. cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, has six discrete typing units (DTUs), and the parasite load varies among these DTUs. The aim of this study was to investigate the parasite load and genotyping of T. cruzi in blood samples of Chagas disease patients from different regions of Brazil, and their association with the severity of chronic cardiac form of Chagas disease. Sixty-five Chagas disease patients, aged from 26 to 76 years old, were recruited and their blood samples were collected and processed to perform molecular tests. The molecular tests were performed using a multilocus conventional PCR (MLC-PCR) targeting three nuclear loci of T. cruzi, SL-IR, 24Sα and A10, and a multiplex real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting satellite DNA of T. cruzi and human RNase P gene. The parasite load was directly estimated from blood samples of patients, before etiological treatment, and the results were pooled and analyzed according to the characteristics of the patients. In general, higher parasite loads were observed in patients infected with T. cruzi DTU II and III. Furthermore, patients with the severe chronic cardiac form of Chagas disease had higher parasite loads, especially those infected with T. cruzi DTU II. These results contribute to update the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and highlight the age of patient and infection by T. cruzi DTU II as important features that lead to the observation of higher parasitemia levels.
The present study aimed to determine if the enhanced bat rabies surveillance system in Guatemala would complement the existing passive surveillance system, and extend information on the geographic distribution of rabies virus circulation among bats to assess the public and veterinary health risks associated with bats in Guatemala. The study involved the collection of 672 bats from 19 field sites, which were examined for the presence of rabies virus antigens and infectious virus using the direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, viral antigen detection, virus isolation, and hemi-nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. The prevalence of rabies virus detection among all collected bats was 0.3%, with viral antigens detected in two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) and one vampire bat (Artibeus jamundi). Sequencing of the nucleoprotein gene showed that both viruses were 100% identical, whereas sequencing of the glycoprotein gene revealed one non-synonymous substitution (302T, S). The two vampire bat RABV isolates in this study were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in the eastern states of Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody. The proportion of seropositive bats varied significantly across trophic guilds, suggesting complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RABV perpetuation. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing bat rabies surveillance in Guatemala and other countries with zoonotic rabies risks.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of the nuclear lamina in regulating herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication. They found that the nuclear lamina plays a critical role in regulating HSV replication, particularly at low multiplicities of infection (MOI). Specifically, they found that deletion of the lamin A/C gene results in reduced heterochromatin association with HSV lytic genes, leading to increased viral replication and growth. They also observed that the nuclear lamina targets HSV DNA to the nuclear periphery, which is important for viral replication. Overall, the findings of this study provide new insights into the role of the nuclear lamina in regulating HSV replication.
The Trichomonas vaginalis parasite has a unique mitochondrion-like organelle called a hydrogenosome, which lacks a mitochondrial outer membrane and relies on anaerobic respiration. The hydrogenosome is essential for the survival of T. vaginalis, and has unique protein import and export systems. Recently, it was shown that T. vaginalis hydrogenosomes have a tripartite pore complex (TPPC) that is similar to the mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex of eukaryotic mitochondria. In the current study, the authors set out to determine the structure of the TPPC and to identify the components of the complex. They did this by performing cryo-electron microscopy of purified hydrogenosomes, which allowed them to determine the structure of the TPPC. They also used proteomics to identify the components of the complex, and found that it is composed of six proteins. These proteins include homologs of the eukaryotic TOM complex proteins TOM40, TOM5, TOM22, TOM7, TOM19, and TOM20, as well as a unique protein called TvTOM36. The authors also found that the TPPC has a unique structure, with a long, skirt-like appendage that protrudes from the complex. They named this appendage the "skirt", and found that it is necessary for the stability and function of the complex. Overall, the study provides important insights into the structure and function of the TPPC and will help to better understand the unique mitochondrial biology of T. vaginalis.
The paper is about studying the link between autoimmune diseases and genetic regulation of the immune system. The authors used purified T cells from 313 healthy individuals to map genetic variations that affect the expression of genes involved in immune response. They found that genetic regulation of gene expression is cell-specific and that certain polymorphisms are associated with specific immune-related diseases. The study highlights the importance of eQTL mapping in purified cells and provides insights into the basic processes of genetic regulation of gene expression in the adaptive immune system.
This article describes the results of a qualitative study on the factors that prevent people from participating in HAT screening and treatment programs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The study was conducted in two provinces, Bandundu and Kasaï Oriental, which are highly endemic for HAT and lagging behind in the control effort. The study involved interviews and focus group discussions with current and former HAT patients, health workers, and program managers of the national HAT control program. The study found that people in these communities are aware of the prohibitions that are associated with the treatment regimen, but they do not understand their rationale. These prohibitions include restrictions on work, food, and sexual intercourse, which lead people to avoid HAT screening campaigns for fear of having to observe these taboos in case of diagnosis. The study suggests that correct health information regarding HAT treatment is essential, and that health providers should address the perspective of the community in a constant dialogue to keep abreast of unintended transformations of meaning. The study highlights the importance of community engagement and participation in HAT control programs, and the need for effective communication and community mobilization to improve uptake of HAT screening and treatment.
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has been treating people with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in eastern Gedaref State, Sudan. A survey was conducted to estimate the VL incidence in villages around Tabarak Allah Hospital. The survey was done between May 5 and June 17, 2011. A total of 45 villages were screened and 17,702 households were interviewed. The survey found a crude mortality rate of 0.13/10,000 people per day, and a VL-specific mortality rate of 0.9/100,000 per year. Overall, 12.5% (11,943/95,609) of the population reported a past VL treatment episode. The survey found a one-year incidence rate of 7.0/100,000 people, and a VL-specific incidence rate of 7.9/100,000 people. The survey also found that 16 people had a new case of VL, 14 of which were confirmed with a rapid test and direct agglutination test. The survey found that 2.1% (1,621/78,408) of the population was a new case of VL, and a VL-specific incidence of 2.3% (8,293/365,609). The survey found that 3.4% (2,992/88,721) of the population was a suspected case of PKDL, but none of them were referred for treatment.

This work describes the use of a new method for measuring supercoiling in bacterial DNA. The method involves the use of a "supercoil sensor" module that allows for the monitoring of both supercoiling and transcription elongation rates in real-time. The authors show that supercoiling levels vary with growth conditions and that mutations in topoisomerases can influence the average supercoil density of the chromosome. They also show that RNA polymerase can influence supercoiling levels, as it can both generate and remove negative supercoils. The authors provide a detailed description of the methods used and the results obtained, making this work accessible to a wide range of researchers.
We have investigated the role of a gene called LYST/Beige, which is known to regulate lysosome size, in the intracellular survival of a species of parasitic protozoan called Leishmania. We found that LYST/Beige expression is upregulated in response to Leishmania infection, and that the size of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) containing Leishmania is larger in LYST/Beige-deficient cells. We also found that inhibition of nitric oxide production can promote Leishmania survival and replication in LYST/Beige-deficient cells. Our results suggest that LYST/Beige functions as an innate defense mechanism against Leishmania infection, by regulating the size of the PVs and reducing the availability of microbicidal molecules. This study highlights the importance of lysosome function in intracellular parasite survival and provides insights into the mechanisms underlying the host response to infection.
The current study describes the generation of a zinc finger (ZF) mutant zebrafish line that lacks the Mct8 transporter gene. Mct8 is a homolog of the human MCT8 transporter, which is essential for normal brain development and function. The zebrafish mct8 mutant displays several developmental defects, including abnormalities in craniofacial and eye structures, as well as a lack of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. These defects are reminiscent of those observed in patients with MCT8 deficiency. The study also shows that the Mct8 transporter is required for proper motor neuron development and function, as evidenced by defective axon arbors and synaptic connections in the mct8 mutant. Finally, the study demonstrates the use of ZF nucleases to generate a mutant zebrafish line with a specific genetic defect.
In this study, the researchers investigated the interaction between HCMV gB and gH/gL molecules. They found that HCMV gB and gH/gL proteins are already complexed in extracellular virions, suggesting that gB is activated for fusion before it undergoes fusion. The researchers also demonstrated that a significant fraction of HCMV gH/gL (devoid of gO or UL128-131) binds to gB in virions. This study provides a different model for how HCMV gB and gH/gL molecules interact and function compared with models for HSV-1 entry.
The study explores the factors that determine the segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants in a mouse model of heteroplasmy. The researchers discovered that the protein Gimap3 is a critical regulator of this process in leukocytes. They found that Gimap3 plays a role in the survival of T cells, which could potentially explain why mtDNA variants segregate differently in different tissues. The findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying mtDNA segregation and may have implications for the development of mitochondrial diseases.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin infection caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium ulcerans. It is most commonly found in parts of Africa, but it has also been reported in Australia. The incubation period, or the time between exposure and symptom onset, of BU has been difficult to estimate due to the fact that most people who acquire the infection are permanent residents of endemic areas. However, in Victoria, Australia, a large proportion of BU cases are visitors to endemic areas, which makes it possible to estimate the incubation period.
This article describes a study that used reverse genetics to create a mutant strain of Toxoplasma gondii (a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis in humans and other animals) that lacks a protein called TgNCR1. The authors used a plasmid-based method to insert a knockout cassette into the TgNCR1 gene, which then underwent homologous recombination to create the mutant strain. The study used a number of different techniques to verify that the mutant strain lacked TgNCR1, including PCR, Southern blotting, and immunofluorescence microscopy. The study also used complementation to restore TgNCR1 to the mutant strain and to confirm that TgNCR1 plays a role in the parasite's growth and development. The authors suggest that TgNCR1 may be a target for the development of new anti-parasitic drugs.
Our study identifies a locus for OAS on 14q24 . 2, containing homozygous, predicted loss-of-function mutations in the SMOC1 gene in eight out of fourteen unrelated families with OAS. The phenotype associated with homozygosity for a targeted “pre-conditional” gene-trap mouse mutation of Smoc1 shows significant overlap with the human disease.
This study identifies a host cellular factor, TRIM22, that is induced by interferon treatment and blocks the late stages of HIV-1 infection. The authors used transcriptional profiling to identify TRIM22 as a factor that was strongly induced by interferon treatment. They then used shRNA knockdown to show that TRIM22 is required for the block of HIV-1 infection at the late stages. The authors also showed that the RING domain of TRIM22 is required for its antiviral activity. Finally, the authors showed that TRIM22 blocks the release of HIV-1 particles by disrupting the trafficking of Gag to the plasma membrane. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms of interferon-mediated antiviral activity and suggests a potential target for the development of new antiretroviral drugs.
Fig trees and their host-specific agaonid pollinator wasps are a classic example of an obligate mutualism. To explain the persistence of this mutualism, the current study tested whether parasitic fig wasps contribute to the overall factors that enable mutualism stability. It found that parasites preferentially exploit outer ovules, resulting in a gradient in ovule profitability to foundresses. This profitability gradient favours foundresses that preferentially oviposit inner ovules, which have increased pollinator and parasite profitability. The study also found that parasites do not appear to have evolved longer ovipositors to exploit more ovules, as a reduction in ovipositor length would not be compensated for by increased benefits. The study suggests that parasites could contribute to the stability of the mutualism, by providing an additional selection pressure that favours the selection of foundresses that preferentially oviposit inner ovules. This study thus provides evidence for the contribution of a third party in shaping the symbiotic relationship between fig trees and their pollinators. It also demonstrates that, despite the short-term costs to both partners, a mutualism can be maintained if there is a gradient in profitability between the two partners.
Plant height is an important trait that influences crop yield and productivity. A large number of genes have been identified in other crops that affect plant height. However, the molecular basis of plant height in Setaria viridis, a model grass, is largely unknown. In this study, the authors used a genetically diverse Setaria viridis population to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with plant height at different stages of plant development. They used different measures of plant height, including height at the end of the growing season and daily height growth rate. They also examined the effects of different environmental conditions, such as water availability and soil nutrient content, on plant height. The authors found that many of the QTL associated with plant height are located in regions of the genome that are syntenic with regions containing genes known to affect plant height in other crops. They also identified several novel QTL that are not syntenic with known plant height genes. The authors suggest that their results provide a starting point for identifying the specific genes that are responsible for plant height variation in Setaria viridis.
In the past few years, researchers have found evidence that several flaviviruses, including yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and West Nile virus, are circulating in Brazil's Pantanal wetlands, which are home to a large number of birds and mammals. In this study, researchers collected mosquitoes from the Pantanal sub-region of Nhecolândia and tested them for evidence of flaviviruses. They found that at least one species of flavivirus, Ilheus virus, is circulating in the Nhecolândia sub-region of Pantanal. The results of this study provide further evidence that the Pantanal is a key location for the transmission of flaviviruses and highlights the need for continued surveillance of mosquito-borne diseases in this region.
Scabies is a skin disease that causes itching, and is a major public health burden worldwide. Treatments for scabies do not work well and may not kill the eggs of the parasite, leading to repeated treatments. Moxidectin (MOX) may be a better treatment option because it has a longer lifespan in the body than the current treatments, which means it could kill the eggs of the parasite. To test if MOX is a better treatment, a study was done where pigs were treated with MOX or Ivermectin (IVM) and the number of mites on their skin was counted, their skin lesions were checked, and their pruritus (itching) levels were measured. The pigs were also tested for antibodies against the parasite. The results showed that MOX was more effective than IVM at killing the mites and reducing skin lesions and itching. MOX also lasted longer in the pigs' bodies, which means it could kill the eggs of the parasite. These findings suggest that MOX could be a better treatment for scabies.
The study of cellular machines has been difficult due to functional redundancy and to the interdependency of proteins within these complexes. To identify the minimal protein composition required for cellular processes, we deleted seven genes encoding PG synthesis enzymes from S . aureus. We show that S . aureus can grow and divide with only two active PG synthesizing enzymes, PBP1 and the bi-functional PBP2 . However, these cells show loss of resistance to cell wall-targeting antibiotics and decreased virulence in a Drosophila infection model which is dependent on the presence of specific peptidoglycan receptor proteins, namely PGRP-SA . These results demonstrate that in environments where the pathogen is under selective pressure from the host or by antibiotics, the expendable PG synthesis enzymes play an important role in the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S . aureus. Our results also indicate that the presence of a complex molecular machine is important for the survival of S . aureus in its natural habitat.
We have comprehensively analyzed the biology of Burkholderia pseudomallei, a saprophytic soil bacterium causing a potentially fatal infectious disease called melioidosis. Our data demonstrate that B. pseudomallei is a secretion-proficient bacterium that synthesizes a broad range of siderophores. We have also shown that the synthesis of B. pseudomallei siderophores is regulated by both iron availability and iron-dependent signals. Our data provide a foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms of iron acquisition in B. pseudomallei and suggest that targeting of B. pseudomallei iron acquisition could be a useful therapeutic strategy for treating melioidosis.
COMMGEN is a new tool for generating consensus models of metabolic networks. It resolves inconsistencies between two or more initial models of the same organism. The tool identifies similarities and dissimilarities between models and generates a consolidated model that includes complementary information from all models. The resulting consensus model is created in a standardized namespace and retains or improves the predictive capabilities of the initial models. COMMGEN has been applied to the generation of consensus models for several organisms including yeast, human, and E. coli. These consensus models represent a more comprehensive understanding of metabolism and can be used for a range of analyses, including the prediction of metabolic phenotypes.
In this study, we identified two genes, fam20b and xylt1, that affect the development of the skeletal tissues in zebrafish. The mutations in these genes lead to decreased cartilage matrix and increased chondral bone formation. We used different techniques to analyze the effects of these mutations on the development of the skeletal tissues in zebrafish, including morphological studies, gene expression analysis, and RNA in situ hybridization. We also performed an analysis of the expression of the Runx2b gene, which is known to be involved in the development of the skeletal tissues in zebrafish. Our study provides important insights into the genetic mechanisms that regulate the development of the skeletal tissues in zebrafish.
This study investigates the role of the Top2 transcription factor in the process of chromosome separation during meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster. The authors used a combination of genetic and molecular techniques to examine the effects of Top2 depletion on chromosome dynamics and separation. They found that depletion of Top2 led to a specific defect in the ability of heterochromatic regions to separate during prometaphase I, as well as a failure of the achiasmate 4th chromosomes to move precociously towards the spindle poles. These defects ultimately resulted in the inability of oocytes to successfully complete meiosis I. The authors concluded that the separation of heterochromatic regions is essential for the proper completion of meiosis, and that Top2 plays a critical role in this process.
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mass use of 4% deltamethrin-impregnated collars in preventing canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in dogs living in a highly endemic area for VL. The dogs in the intervention area were collared and continued to be collared throughout the study, while the dogs in the control area received the standard of care for VL control, which did not include collar use.

We have found that genes with high expression breadth, or genes that are expressed in many tissues, are more likely to be located on the X chromosome and that this is a conserved feature across therian mammals. This is consistent with previous observations that expression in the germ line is reduced on the X chromosome, as this leads to a reduction in the breadth of expression of genes that have paralogs on the autosomes. We have also found that the reduction in breadth of expression on the X is not due to selection against male-biased expression, as there is no difference in expression breadth between genes with male-biased expression and those without, both on the X and autosomes. We have, therefore, proposed a new theory that the reduction in breadth of expression on the X is due to the increased level of expression on the X leading to a traffic jam effect, where there is competition for transcriptional output, resulting in a reduction in breadth of expression. This theory is supported by evidence from other species, including plants and yeast, where expression in the germ line is reduced and the breadth of expression of genes with paralogs on autosomes is lower on the X chromosome.
We looked at the prevalence and structure of Helicobacter pylori infections among Cameroonians. We found that the prevalence of infection was lower in the Baka Pygmies than in neighboring agriculturalists. We did not find a new population of H. pylori among the Baka, suggesting that they acquired their infections from non-Baka neighbors. We also found that the frequency of infection among the Baka was probably limited by their small population size and other demographic factors.
Dengue viruses are a major cause of viral infections worldwide, and can lead to severe complications such as hemorrhagic fever and death. The viral protein NS5 is a key protein for the replication of the dengue virus, and contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) that allows it to be transported to the nucleus of the host cell. In this study, we have identified a monomeric NLS in the C-terminus of DENV NS5 that mediates nuclear localization of the protein. We have also identified a novel role for this NLS, which is that it mediates the interaction between NS5 and importin-α, a protein that is necessary for nuclear transport. We have used a combination of molecular biology and biophysical techniques, including X-ray crystallography, to identify this NLS. Our results suggest that the NLS in the C-terminus of NS5 plays a key role in the replication of the dengue virus, and that it is a potential target for the development of therapeutic agents.
Neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ) are common in developing countries and have negative impacts on health and well-being. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends that public health interventions be implemented in areas where disease prevalence exceeds certain thresholds. However, many NTD-endemic countries have not been able to launch or scale-up programs because they lack the necessary baseline data. In this study, a new methodology called the integrated threshold mapping ( ITM ) methodology was developed and field-tested for lymphatic filariasis ( LF ), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ). The methodology is designed to be resource-efficient and to determine whether a threshold for public health intervention has been attained. The protocol is specific to the disease-specific age groups. The methodology was compared to the current WHO mapping methodologies for each disease in one district each in Mali and Senegal. The results of both methodologies were compared in terms of public health intervention, and feasibility, including cost. The study found that the ITM methodology reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies regarding the initiation of public health interventions for trachoma, LF and STH, but resulted in more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. The ITM was practical, feasible, and demonstrated an overall cost saving compared with the standard non-integrated WHO methodologies. The integrated mapping tool could facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries.
The present study is a comprehensive examination of the role of histone H4 ubiquitination in chromatin dynamics and transcriptional regulation during the cell cycle. The authors show that H4 ubiquitination is regulated by the E3 ligase ZNF326A, and that this modification is essential for the proper segregation of chromosomes at mitosis. Furthermore, they demonstrate that H4 ubiquitination is required for the activation of specific genes during S phase. Overall, this work provides a detailed picture of the role of H4 ubiquitination in regulating chromatin dynamics and transcription during the cell cycle.
The paper describes the development and application of a new statistical method, GeneProgram, for analyzing large genome-wide expression datasets. The method is designed to automatically discover coherent sets of genes that are differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner, and to represent these sets as expression programs. The method is based on a probabilistic model that can accommodate different types of data and experimental conditions, and can be used to summarize expression data over multiple time-points or tissues. The authors evaluate the performance of the method on synthetic and real-world data, and use it to discover new insights into the response of human tissues to infection. The method provides a new approach to understanding complex expression patterns in large datasets, and has the potential to be useful in a wide range of applications.
NK cells are an important part of the innate immune system and are known to play a role in protecting against viral infections. NK cells are characterized by their expression of the interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) gene, which is involved in the antiviral response. In this study, the authors investigated the epigenetic regulation of IFN-γ in NK cells from healthy individuals and those with viral infections. They found that NK cells from individuals with viral infections had a different epigenetic pattern in the IFN-γ locus, which could be responsible for the high IFN-γ production observed in these cells. The authors also identified a subset of NK cells with memory-like properties that displayed a specific epigenetic pattern, which could contribute to their enhanced ability to produce IFN-γ in response to viral infections. Overall, this study provides important insights into the epigenetic regulation of IFN-γ in NK cells and its potential role in viral infections.
Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterium that is found in freshwater environments. When it is phagocytosed by eukaryotic cells, it remodels the Legionella-containing phagosome to form a compartment that allows its intracellular replication. L. pneumophila is able to replicate in a wide variety of phagocytic cells, from amoebae to macrophages. The Dot/Icm type IV secretion system is an essential virulence determinant that translocates L. pneumophila effector proteins into host cells during infection. These effector proteins control host cell functions to initiate trafficking of the L. pneumophila vacuole, promote host cell survival, modulate innate immune responses, and promote bacterial egress. There are over 100 known L. pneumophila effector proteins, but the biochemical and cellular functions of most effector proteins remain unknown. In this study, the authors identify a new class of bacterial effectors called "metaeffector" that targets and regulates a cognate effector within the host cells. The metaeffector LubX, which carries two U-box domains, functions as a negative temporal regulator of SidH within host cells. The authors also identify the gene encoding SidH as a target of LubX. They propose the designation "metaeffector" for this class of bacterial effectors and identify a novel mechanism by which L. pneumophila effectors are regulated.
HIV-1 virus rapidly diversifies following transmission, and this diversification is thought to be driven by escape from the host's immune response. In this study, we analyze patterns of diversification in HIV-1 env gene in 81 homogeneous infections. We found that rapid diversification of the virus typically occurs at CTL epitope sites in early infection, indicating that escape from CTL responses is a common and early event. In some cases, rapid diversification occurred at sites with high mutation rates, suggesting that APOBEC-mediated mutation may drive the pathway of immune escape. Frameshifting insertions and deletions are evenly spread throughout env, but are preferentially fixed in the variable regions. These results provide the most detailed view yet of the process of diversification of the homogeneous viral population following transmission.
The paper proposes a minimal mathematical model for the epigenetic silencing of yeast genes. The model incorporates known interactions between histone proteins and various enzymes that add or remove chemical groups from histone proteins, which in turn affects the interaction of Sir proteins with chromatin. The model suggests that multiple different histone modifications can be present simultaneously in a single region of chromatin, creating a 'bivalent' state that is stable in the presence of certain perturbations. The paper also highlights the importance of non-linear interactions between histone modifications in the formation of bivalent states and the stability of epigenetic silencing. Overall, the model provides a framework for understanding the complex interactions between histone modifications and their role in the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic silencing.
In this study, we investigated whether gut microbiota (GM) composition differs between children with oedematous or non-oedematous malnutrition. We used stool samples from 87 children aged 6–24 months who were admitted to the hospital for treatment of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Uganda. We extracted total genomic DNA from the samples and performed PCR amplification followed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and tag-encoded 16S rRNA gene-targeted high throughput amplicon sequencing. We then analyzed GM composition by comparing alpha and beta diversity measures, and ANOVA mean relative abundance and G-test of independence between the two groups. We found that GM composition differs between children with oedematous and non-oedematous malnutrition, with non-oedematous children having lower GM diversity. However, we did not find any clear compositional differences between the two groups. These findings suggest that non-oedematous malnutrition is associated with lower GM diversity compared to oedematous malnutrition.
The study aimed to investigate the variation in telomere length among yeast isolates and identify the genetic factors that influence it. The researchers screened 112 wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates and found extensive telomere length variation in S. paradoxus isolates. This variation was associated with the geographic origin of the isolates, with European strains having very short telomeres and American strains having telomeres three times as long. Insertions of a URA3 gene near telomeres allowed accurate analysis of individual telomere lengths and telomere position effect (TPE). Crossing the American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telomere lengths, suggesting that many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) are involved in length maintenance. Variation in TPE was also quantitative but only weakly correlated with telomere length. Genotyping F1 segregants identified several QTLs associated with telomere length and silencing variation. These QTLs include likely candidate genes but also map to regions where there are no known genes involved in telomeric properties. The researchers validated by reciprocal hemizygosity that YKU80 and TLC1 are telomere-length QTLs in the two S. paradoxus subpopulations. Furthermore, they propose that sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer generates negative epistasis within one of the allelic combinations, resulting in very short telomeres.
We applied computational modeling to the data from a recent electroencephalography ( EEG ) study investigating value-based decision making in the human brain. Our model includes an explicit decision not to decide process, which results in a delay of the final decision. We also found that the decision not to decide is accompanied by an increase in oscillatory power in the beta band ( 14–30 Hz ), a well-established neural marker of inhibition of motor responses. Finally, we tested our model experimentally in the context of an adapted version of our task. Our results support the conclusion that the decision not to decide process is a fundamental component of the decision-making process and can have a profound effect on the final decision.
We have identified a monogenic autosomal recessive mutation in the SUV39H2 gene that causes the HNPK phenotype in Labrador Retrievers. This mutation causes an amino acid change in a highly conserved region of the SUV39H2 protein that is essential for its function. The mutation affects a residue that is critical for catalysis and it is predicted to cause a defect in the methylation of histones. This defect results in the failure of the epidermis to undergo the final differentiation step, leading to the accumulation of proteinaceous fluid in the stratum corneum. This defect causes the characteristic clinical signs of HNPK, including crusts and fissures on the nasal planum.
The study aimed to investigate the genotypes and phenotypes of reassortants generated in swine co-infected with avian and swine influenza A viruses. The study used 57 influenza A viruses recovered from 43 feral swine that were experimentally inoculated with a mixture of avian and swine influenza A viruses. The study found that many different reassortants were generated in the swine, but the majority of these had PB2 and PB1 genes from swine and H3N2 genes from avian viruses. The study also found that some of the reassortants were transmitted to contact swine and caused infection, but the study did not determine which tissue tropisms were associated with transmissibility. Overall, the study demonstrated the importance of studying the genotypes and phenotypes of reassortants generated in swine co-infected with avian and swine influenza A viruses.
We conducted a follow-up study of children born to pregnant women with schistosomiasis in Uganda. We examined whether maternal schistosomiasis affects the children's schistosome infections, immune responses, and regulatory T cell frequencies at age five years. We found that maternal schistosomiasis did not influence the children's schistosome infections or immune responses, but maternal treatment with praziquantel during pregnancy was associated with lower expression of FoxP3 on regulatory T cells in the children. This may indicate that maternal treatment during pregnancy affects the children's immunoregulatory responses to schistosomiasis, although more research is needed to confirm this.
In order to eliminate the need for macrophages to undergo reprogramming from phagocytosis to macropinocytosis during infection, a protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway was discovered to be responsible for this change. This pathway is activated by different stimuli, including IFN-γ, which triggers the phosphorylation of serine residues in the coronin 1 protein. These phosphorylated residues interact with Eps8, a protein that links to the F-actin cytoskeleton and enhances its polymerization. This enhances the formation of macropinosomes and thus the internalization of bacteria. By inhibiting the PKC signaling pathway, it was possible to block the reprogramming of macrophages and thus prevent the internalization of bacteria.
The paper is about a study conducted in Arua District, Uganda to assess the knowledge, perceptions, and acceptance of tsetse baits (traps and targets) in villages where they had or had not been used previously. The study aimed to understand community acceptance of traps, which is a crucial element for successful tsetse control. The study involved 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages across Arua District. Discussions were audio recorded, translated, and transcribed. The results showed that while communities in villages where tsetse baits had been used previously had positive attitudes towards them, communities in villages where baits had never been used had negative perceptions of them. The negative perceptions were related to the duration of experience with tsetse control programs, which were seen as harmful to livestock. The study recommends that early engagements with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns are needed to build acceptance of tsetse baits. This is important for successful tsetse control, which can help to reduce the risk of HAT in West Nile, Uganda.
Recombination is a fundamental biological process that allows for genetic diversity and evolution. It is especially important in the context of sex chromosomes, where recombination has been shown to be reduced or absent. Despite the importance of recombination, our understanding of the rates and distribution of recombination across the genome remains limited due to the difficulty of accurately detecting recombination events and the heterogeneity of recombination rates across the genome. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing and a custom-designed mapping protocol to accurately detect and map recombination events in Drosophila melanogaster. We sequenced eight crosses involving RAL strains, which are a widely used strain set in Drosophila genetics. We mapped each cross to a reference genome and calculated recombination rates for each chromosome arm. We found that recombination rates vary significantly across the genome, with some regions having higher recombination rates and others having lower recombination rates. We also found that the distribution of recombination events is significantly overdispersed, suggesting that there may be some underlying biological mechanisms influencing the distribution of recombination events. Additionally, we found that there is a bias towards GC/G heterozygotes being preferentially repaired towards G and C nucleotides, which is consistent with a previous study on the same strain set. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of recombination rates and their distribution across the genome of Drosophila melanogaster.
In the present study, we have identified two IDN2 paralogs, IDP1 and IDP2, in Arabidopsis. IDN2 is a key component of the RdDM pathway that is required for DNA methylation and siRNA accumulation. The IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex facilitates the recruitment of effector complexes to specific chromatin regions at a downstream step of the RdDM pathway. Unlike IDN2, IDP1 and IDP2 are incapable of binding double-stranded RNA, suggesting that they have distinct roles in the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex. The IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex plays a crucial role in the RdDM pathway, which is responsible for maintaining genome stability and regulating gene expression.
Neutrophils are an important part of the first line of defense against invading pathogens. During Leishmania infection, neutrophils play distinct roles depending on the combination of mouse strain and parasite species. In this study, we focused on understanding how neutrophils interact with Leishmania braziliensis, a parasite that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis. We found that exposure of neutrophils to L. braziliensis induces changes in the expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CD62L, and leads to the oxidative burst. Using mCherry-expressing L. braziliensis, we determined that these effects were mainly observed in infected cells and not in bystander cells. We also found that neutrophils exposed to L. braziliensis release TNF-α and neutrophil elastase. Lastly, we found that neutrophils infected with L. braziliensis display markers of early apoptosis. We show that L. braziliensis induces neutrophil recruitment in vivo and that neutrophils exposed to L. braziliensis respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This outcome may impact on parasite elimination, particularly at the early stages of infection.
This article describes the development of a within-herd transmission model of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) to evaluate the potential impact of new diagnostic tests on the control of bTB in Great Britain. The model was developed using an individual-based approach with stochastic processes to simulate the spread of infection between cattle within herds. The model includes the impact of various factors such as herd size, herd structure, and demographics on the transmission of bTB. It also incorporates the effects of vaccination on the transmission of bTB and the impact of different diagnostic tests on the detection of infected animals. The model was used to evaluate the effectiveness of different diagnostic tests and the potential impact of new diagnostic tests on the control of bTB in Great Britain. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of considering the potential impact of new diagnostic tests on the control of bTB and the need for further research to better understand the effectiveness of new diagnostic tests in controlling the disease.
Trichuriasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura. It is estimated that 500 million people worldwide are infected and it is a leading cause of disability in children. Current treatments are not very effective and there is a need for new anthelmintic compounds. In this study, researchers screened 480 small molecules from a drug-like library against Trichuris muris using an automated motility assay. They identified a new class of molecules, the dihydrobenzoxazepinones, which are active against both the adult and egg stages of Trichuris. These compounds have low cytotoxicity against murine gut epithelial cells and one of the compounds, OX02983, was found to reduce the ability of embryonated T. muris eggs to establish infection in the mouse host in vivo. These results demonstrate the potential of the dihydrobenzoxazepinones as a new class of anthelmintic compounds active against both the egg and adult stages of Trichuris. They also highlight the potential for targeting the egg stage of the parasite in infection control strategies.
The original hypothesis that date hubs are global connectors is contested in the revised paper, as the effect of deleting date hubs on network connectivity is attributed to a small subset of them. The paper also explores the validity of the date/party dichotomy and suggests that the functional roles of hubs might be better described by link-centric measures rather than node-centric ones.
This paper describes the development of a new method to measure the information content of genetic data in different pathogen outbreaks. The authors introduce the concept of "transmission divergence," defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs. They use parameter values obtained by literature review, and simulate outbreak scenarios alongside sequence evolution using two models described in the literature. The authors find that, while mean values vary significantly between the pathogens considered, their transmission divergence is generally very low. They also describe the impact of transmission divergence on our ability to reconstruct outbreaks using two outbreak reconstruction tools, the R packages outbreaker and phybreak. They illustrate the importance of transmission divergence for outbreak reconstruction and the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data.
This study aimed to identify escape genes in vivo in mouse tissues using RNA-seq and allele-specific expression analysis. A mouse model was used with complete skewing of the XCI of the spretus X due to an Xist mutation on the BL6 X. This model allowed for the identification of common and tissue-specific escape genes. The results showed that the percentage of escape genes varies between tissues, ranging from 3-7% in any tissue examined. The study also identified potential regulatory mechanisms for escape genes, such as CTCF occupancy. The findings of this study have significant implications for understanding the regulation of XCI and the maintenance of dosage compensation in mammals.
The manuscript entitled "Characterization of a novel cysteine protease from Plasmodium vivax" describes the molecular and biochemical characterization of a novel cysteine protease named VX-4 from Plasmodium vivax. The authors first identified VX-4 from a phylogenetic tree and then expressed and purified it from E. coli. They then determined the optimal conditions for refolding and characterized its enzymatic activity. The authors also performed a kinetic analysis of VX-4 and determined its substrate specificity. Finally, they performed immunoblotting experiments and found that VX-4 is expressed in the erythrocytic stages of P. vivax.
This is a scientific paper that describes the reconstruction of a metabolic and gene expression (ME) model for the acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii. The model was reconstructed using existing literature and data, and includes all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways as well as pathways to synthesis RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. The model accurately predicted secretion of acetate, ethanol, and glycerol during changing carbon and metal availability and revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in this model acetogen. The paper provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in understanding acetogen metabolism and its potential for biotechnological applications.
In this study, the authors used genome-wide association analysis to identify differentially expressed genes in a panel of primary osteoblasts from patients with osteoporosis and healthy controls. The analysis revealed a list of 274,097 probesets, including 17,749 meta-probesets, that were differentially expressed between osteoporotic and control bone samples. The authors then focused on probesets that were associated with flanking single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 250 Kb of the flanking genes. This analysis revealed 101 probesets that were differentially expressed in response to specific SNPs, and the authors then validated these associations using real-time PCR. Finally, the authors identified a set of 28 candidate genes, including FAM118A, that were differentially expressed in response to specific SNPs and that were also associated with osteoporosis in previous studies. These findings provide a valuable resource for further research into the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying osteoporosis.
Scientists have discovered a new way to make a type of beer called lager. They found a way to make it using a yeast called Saccharomyces eubayanus, which is not commonly used in brewing. This yeast does not use a certain type of sugar called maltotriose, which is found in the wort used to make beer. To fix this problem, the scientists used a technique called laboratory evolution to make the yeast use maltotriose. They did this by exposing the yeast to chemicals and then growing it in a special type of food called wort. After several rounds of this process, the yeast was able to use maltotriose. The scientists also found that this process happened because of a change in the yeast's genes, which is a common way for living things to adapt to their environment. This change allowed the yeast to use a new type of food that it could not use before.
Influenza is a serious health concern and its strains with distinct antigenicity are a significant threat to public health. Researchers have developed a novel model called "EADpred" to assess the mortality burden of influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus by accurately predicting its antigenic distance to its previous strains for each season. The model uses the antigenic distance to predict the total excess all-cause mortality caused by influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus in a given season. The model was tested using data from 1977 to 2009 and was found to have a high predictive accuracy. This study demonstrates that the antigenic distance of influenza virus can be used to predict the mortality burden of influenza, which can help in formulating cost-effective control and intervention strategies for influenza.
This study examines the virulence factors of the Asian Soybean Rust pathogen, Phakopsora pachyrhizi. The authors identify a small cysteine-rich protein, PpEC23, that suppresses the plant's defense system, allowing the rust fungus to grow and spread. The authors also show that PpEC23 interacts with a soybean transcription factor, GmSPL12l, which is involved in the plant's defense response. This study provides important insights into how pathogens manipulate the host plant's immune system to establish infection and cause disease.
We have identified the EphA2 receptor as a host-derived protein that Chlamydia trachomatis adheres to and invades through during infection. We have shown that Chlamydia-induced activation of the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is mediated through EphA2 and that the loss of EphA2 leads to increased sensitivity of the host cells to apoptosis induction. Our findings suggest that EphA2 functions as a signaling receptor that Chlamydia utilizes to modulate the host cell response during infection.
In this study, we propose a model that explains the role of active dendritic conductances in dendritic excitability. We show that, owing to the non-linear properties of active dendritic conductances, the average output of a model of an active dendritic tree is a highly non-linear function of its afferent rate. This allows dendrites to enlarge their dynamic range, reaching an average output of over 50 dB. Our model also yields double-sigmoid response functions, as observed in retinal ganglion cells, and we claim that the enhancement of dynamic range is the primary functional role of active dendritic conductances.
Bacteria use regulatory networks to adapt to different environments. The study of these networks is important for understanding bacterial behavior and for applications in fields such as biotechnology, drug discovery, and medicine. However, the study of these networks is challenging because it requires the inference of regulatory interactions from noisy time-series data. In this work, we use fluorescent reporter proteins to monitor gene expression in real time. We then develop a method to correct for the difference between mRNA and protein concentrations and to incorporate global physiological effects in the inference of regulatory interactions. We apply our method to the study of the FliA-FlgM module in the E. coli motility network, using both wild-type and mutant strains, and in different growth conditions. We find that the inclusion of protein concentrations and global physiological effects is necessary to obtain a reliable inference of the regulatory interactions. We then use the derived regulatory model to predict the dynamics of the network, both structurally and quantitatively, and find that our inference method allows the model to fit the observed data much better than a previously used approach.
This paper describes a study of the distribution and dynamics of Oligoryzomys fulvescens, a rodent species in Panama, using non-spatial and spatial statistical analyses. The authors found that there were heterogeneous patterns in the population densities and dispersal of O. fulvescens, which varied across seasons and among years. The species typically was locally absent during the late transitional months of the season, and re-established locally in subsequent years. These populations re-occurred in the same area during the first three years but subsequently re-established further south in the final year of the study. The spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that local populations encompassed approximately 300–600 m. The borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats were sharply demarcated over short distances. O. fulvescens showed a well-defined spatial pattern that evolved over time, and led to a pattern of changing aggregation. Thus, hot spots of abundance showed a general shifting pattern that helps explain the intermittent risk from pathogens transmitted by this species. This variation was associated with seasonality, as well as anthropogenic pressures that occurred with agricultural activities. These factors help define the characteristics of the occurrence, timing, intensity, and duration of synanthropic populations affected by human populations and, consequently, the potential exposure that local human populations experience. The authors conclude that the results of their study provide insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of rodent hosts, which may help explain the risk of pathogens that are transmitted from wildlife to humans.
The article describes a new method for predicting the impact of amino acid changes on the antigenic phenotype of influenza A viruses. The method, called antigenic tree inference, is based on a least-squares optimization procedure that fits pairwise antigenic distances onto an evolutionary tree for the major antigenic determinant of influenza A viruses. The authors applied this method to infer antigenic trees for human influenza A viruses from 1968 to 2003. They found that the method accurately predicted the antigenic distances between isolates based on antigenic cartography data. Additionally, the authors identified known and novel antigenic types, as well as the amino acid changes associated with the transition between antigenic types. The method could also be used to predict the antigenic impact of individual amino acid exchanges in the evolution of influenza A viruses. The authors suggest that this method could be useful for understanding the evolution of influenza A viruses and predicting the antigenic properties of novel viral isolates.
Using a high-throughput RNAi screen, we identified host cell factors and processes that are required for the entry of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) into cells. HPV16 entry requires the permeabilization of the nuclear envelope and association of the virus with host cell chromatin. Mitosis is important for HPV16 nuclear entry since it allows the association of the virus with host cell chromatin aligned on the metaphase plate. Our findings provide a mechanistic insight into the process of HPV16 entry into host cells.
This article presents a detailed description of the genome sequence of the banana fungus Phytophthora fijiensis, a major cause of banana plantations disease. The authors used a combination of genetic mapping and sequencing techniques to assemble the genome, and identified over 10,000 predicted protein-coding genes. The article also includes a description of the resistance mechanisms and virulence factors present in the fungus, as well as a comparison of the P. fijiensis genome to the genomes of other plant pathogens.
The study presents a new approach for analyzing the evolution of regulatory elements in different species. Traditional approaches focus on the conservation of sequences to identify regulatory elements. However, this new approach uses a birth-death model to trace the evolution of lineage-specific binding sites without relying on detailed base-by-base cross-species alignments. The model was applied to analyze the evolution of binding sites based on the ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors (GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, ETS1) along the lineage toward human after human-mouse common ancestor. The results indicate that a substantial fraction of binding sites in humans have origins since the divergence with mouse. The study also found that over 15% of all binding sites are unique to hominids. These elements are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways and harbor more common SNPs than older binding sites in the human genome. The results support the ability of the method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and help understand their roles in shaping variation in gene regulation across species.
In this study, the authors identify a region of the zebrafish per2 promoter that is required for light-driven per2 expression in both vivo and vitro conditions. They use a combination of transient expression assays, transgenic fish lines, and knock-down experiments to characterize this regulatory region. The authors find that a 43-base-pair region of the per2 promoter is sufficient to drive light-dependent per2 expression and that this region contains two transcription factor binding sites, one for the circadian clock protein BMAL1 and one for the light-inducible transcription factor TEFI. The authors also show that TEFI is required for light-driven per2 expression and that it acts through the E-box binding site in the per2 promoter. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of light entrainment in the zebrafish circadian clock.
This article describes a study that investigated the role of coronin in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the human malaria parasite's stage that infects mosquitoes. The authors found that coronin is required for efficient transmission of the parasite from mosquitoes to mice. They also demonstrated that coronin plays a role in sporozoite motility through actin filament-binding. Lastly, they suggest a switch in signaling pathways linking calcium- and cAMP- mediated signaling during migration and invasion.
This study describes the characterization of Leishmania mexicana strains with altered sterol composition and function. The study used whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing to identify genetic changes in these strains, and qRT-PCR and western blotting to validate the results. The study also showed that these strains are more resistant to amphotericin B and have altered intracellular growth patterns in macrophages. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of the mechanisms behind drug resistance in Leishmania parasites, and may inform the development of new drugs to combat these infections.
How does the brain process information from visual stimuli? Using EEG data from a visual grating task, we analyzed how attention and prediction affect the neural representation of visual features. We found that attention modulates the neural response to the predicted stimulus but not to the unpredicted stimulus, and that the neural representation of the predicted stimulus is more robust across trials. These results suggest that attention enhances the neural representation of information that is expected to be most relevant, while also reducing the neural response to unexpected information.
The sub-Saharan African parasite Trypanosoma brucei causes the deadly disease human African sleeping sickness (HASS). There are three main sub-species of T. brucei that differ in their virulence towards humans and animals. One sub-species, T. b. rhodesiense, is highly virulent to both humans and animals, while the other two sub-species, T. b. gambiense and T. b. brucei, are less virulent to humans, but can still cause serious disease in animals. Previous research has shown that the serum resistance mechanism of T. b. rhodesiense is dependent on the expression of a serum resistance associated (SRA) gene. However, the serum resistance mechanism of T. b. gambiense is not yet understood. In this study, the authors investigate the serum resistance mechanism of T. b. gambiense by comparing the properties of the human serum resistance phenotypes of two different T. b. gambiense sub-groups. They found that one sub-group had a variable human serum resistance phenotype, similar to T. b. rhodesiense, while the other sub-group had a stable human serum resistance phenotype. The authors then used recombinant APOL1, a human serum factor that is part of the trypanolytic factor (TLF) complex, to investigate whether this complex is involved in the serum resistance of T. b. gambiense. They found that the variable sub-group of T. b. gambiense was resistant to APOL1, while the stable sub-group was sensitive. This suggests that the serum resistance mechanism of T. b. gambiense may be different from that of T. b. rhodesiense, and may involve a different trypanolytic factor.
The current paper is about investigating whether DNA methylation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) plays a role in regulating HIV-1 latency. The authors use a model of HIV-1 latency and a patient study to investigate the role of methylation in controlling the reactivation of HIV-1 from latency. They find that DNA methylation of the HIV-1 LTR plays a role in controlling the reactivation of HIV-1, but not in the initial suppression of HIV-1 transcription. The authors also show that DNA methylation of the HIV-1 LTR differs between patients with different levels of HIV-1 viremia.
A study has been conducted to identify genetic variants in 39 lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) using an integrative and local assembly-based approach for variant discovery. The study identifies more than 3 . 6 million distinct variants, among which are over 800,000 unique insertions, deletions (indels), and complex variants (1 to 6,000 bp). The SNP density is higher near other variants, but variants themselves are not mutagenic, nor are regions with high variant density particularly mutation-prone. Rather, the elevated SNP density around variants is mainly due to population-level processes. The study also provides insights into the regulatory architecture of gene expression variation in adult flies by mapping cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) for more than 2,000 genes. Indels comprise around 10% of all cis-eQTLs and show larger effects than SNP cis-eQTLs. The study identifies two-fold more gene associations in males as compared to females and finds that most cis-eQTLs are sex-specific, revealing a partial decoupling of the genomic architecture between the sexes as well as the importance of genetic factors in mediating sex-biased gene expression. Finally, the study performs RNA-seq-based allelic expression imbalance analyses in the offspring of crosses between sequenced lines, which reveals that the majority of strong cis-eQTLs can be validated in heterozygous individuals. The full catalog of variants can be obtained from dgrp.epfl.ch/downloads and the RNA-seq data are available in the ArrayExpress Database using accession number E-MTAB-1266.
The relationship between the rectified surface electromyographic (EMG) signal and the neural drive to muscles can be influenced by amplitude cancellation. Amplitude cancellation refers to the reduction of the total amplitude of the sum of individual motor unit action potentials compared to the rectified EMG signal. This reduction can be modeled as a signal-dependent noise term, which in turn alters the power spectrum of the rectified EMG signal. The extent of this distortion is greatest for low frequencies, which reduces the ability to accurately infer individual frequency components of the neural drive from the rectified EMG signal.
The YUC family of enzymes is involved in the regulation of auxin production, which is important for root growth and development. The authors investigated the role of YUC enzymes in the regulation of auxin production during root growth inhibition in response to aluminum (Al) stress. The results show that YUC enzymes are involved in regulating the local production of auxin, which is important for the regulation of root growth and development. The authors also identified transcription factors, such as EIN3, PIF4, and ARF1, that are involved in the regulation of YUC enzymes during root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.
In this study, researchers investigated the function of natural killer (NK) cells in controlling simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in rhesus macaques. They found that certain SIV peptides, which bind to specific receptors on NK cells called killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), can suppress the activity of NK cells. These findings suggest that SIV may have evolved mechanisms to evade detection by NK cells, which could contribute to the ability of SIV to establish and maintain long-term infections in macaques. The researchers also discovered that changes in certain residues of SIV peptides can affect their ability to inhibit NK cells, providing a possible basis for the emergence of SIV variants with altered virulence. These findings provide important insights into the complex interactions between viruses and host immune cells, and highlight the potential for viruses to evade the immune response and cause disease.
In this study, we describe the in vitro evolution of a strain of Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) that has undergone microevolution in response to nutrient limitation. We identified a single-nucleotide mutation in the icc gene, which encodes a 3′, 5′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) phosphodiesterase, that contributes to the adaptation of this strain to an intracellular niche. The mutation results in an amino acid change in the enzyme that alters its cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. This mutation is likely to be responsible for the increased intracellular survival of the mutant strain in the presence of a heme-iron restriction. Additionally, the mutant strain exhibits increased virulence in a chinchilla model of H. influenzae infection, leading to increased inflammation and a higher number of bacterial cells in the middle ear. Overall, our findings suggest that microevolution in response to nutrient limitation can lead to increased virulence and adaptation to the intracellular environment in H. influenzae.
The immune response of mammals to bacterial infections is mediated by many different mechanisms, one of which is the control of iron availability for the pathogen. Iron is essential for bacterial growth and virulence, and limiting its availability to the pathogen has been shown to be an effective strategy to restrict its growth. The bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is a gram-negative, non-spore forming bacterium that causes the disease melioidosis in humans and animals. It has been shown that B. pseudomallei is able to grow under iron-limiting conditions, and that its ability to acquire iron from its environment is crucial for its growth and virulence. In this study, the authors investigated the mechanisms by which B. pseudomallei is able to acquire iron from its environment, and how these mechanisms are affected by the host immune response. They found that B. pseudomallei is able to acquire iron through a variety of mechanisms, including the use of siderophores, heme, and transferrin. They also found that the host immune response is able to limit the availability of iron to B. pseudomallei, through the upregulation of iron-binding proteins and the downregulation of iron export systems. The authors conclude that the ability of B. pseudomallei to acquire iron is crucial for its growth and virulence, and that the host immune response plays an important role in limiting its ability to do so.
The paper presents a new method called "functional mode analysis" (FMA) that allows for identifying the collective motion of a protein that is directly related to a particular protein function. This method is applied to four biomolecules to illustrate its use: a polyalanine helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein. In FMA, a functional quantity that quantifies the functional state of the protein is used. The technique seeks the collective motion that is maximally correlated to the functional quantity and optimizes it iteratively. The method is useful to understand the relation between the protein function and its motions.
This study provides an in-depth analysis of the order of intron removal in the nuclear genes of Euglena gracilis, a unicellular eukaryotic organism. The researchers used a combination of sequencing technologies and bioinformatics to analyze the splicing of introns in two genes of Euglena gracilis. They found that the order of intron removal is not always consistent with the arrangement of introns in the gene, and that this process can take place much later than expected. The researchers also identified a set of introns that are removed much later than the others, and suggest that this may be due to their unusual structure or the presence of alternative splicing. Overall, this study provides a valuable resource for researchers studying eukaryotic splicing and the formation of introns.
In this study, the authors developed a mouse model of juvenile infection with a subclinical dose of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) that caused no evident symptoms either immediately following infection or in adult mice. However, following physiological or pharmacologically-induced cardiac stress, juvenile-infected adult mice underwent cardiac hypertrophy and dilation indicative of progression to heart failure. The authors also observed a compensatory increase in CD31+ blood vessel formation in the hearts of adult mice subjected to cardiac stress, but this effect was suppressed in juvenile-infected mice. Additionally, CVB3 efficiently infected juvenile c-kit+ cells, and cardiac progenitor cell numbers were reduced in the hearts of juvenile-infected adult mice. These results suggest that the exhausted cardiac progenitor cell pool following juvenile CVB3 infection may impair the heart's ability to increase capillary density to adapt to increased load. This study provides evidence that a mild CVB3 infection may predispose the heart to pathologic remodeling later in adult life.
The current paper investigates the role of caspase-1 in the pathogenesis of Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium that causes melioidosis. Melioidosis is a rare but often fatal infection that is endemic in certain regions of Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. The study shows that caspase-1 is activated in infected macrophages and plays a key role in the induction of pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of cell death. The paper also shows that caspase-1 activation is required for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, the study shows that caspase-1 is activated in response to flagellin, a protein found in the flagella of B. pseudomallei. Flagellin is known to be a potent activator of caspase-1 in other bacterial infections, including Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes. Taken together, the study suggests that caspase-1 plays an important role in the host response to B. pseudomallei infection and may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
In this study, we isolated kinβγ knockout mutants and found that kinβγ plays an important role in pollen germination on the stigma surface. The kinβγ knockout mutants exhibited defective pollen germination in vivo and in vitro, which was attributed to the reduced ROS level in the pollen. The results suggest that the kinβγ knockout mutants have a defect in the pollen–stigma interface, which is a critical step for pollen germination.
The study shows that RNase III is essential for Bacillus subtilis to survive. It degrades two type I toxin-encoding mRNAs, txpA and yonT, which are from two prophages (Skin and SPβ) in the bacterial genome. The researchers used multiple techniques to investigate the role of RNase III in the degradation of these mRNAs, including RNA sequencing, Northern blot analysis, and in vitro RNA cleavage assays. The study suggests that the essential role of RNase III in Bacillus subtilis is to protect the cell from the expression of harmful toxin genes in prophages.
We have shown that EV release is not restricted to infective stage parasites but is conserved across the life cycle of B. malayi. The Excretory/Secretory system represents one mechanism for EV release, which are uniformly internalized by murine macrophages via phagocytosis. EVs from different life stages of Brugia spp. contain known and putative host immunomodulatory molecules but the asymmetric distribution of these molecules between male and female worms suggests Brugia’s ability to modulate the host immune response may have a sexual dimorphic element.
The article describes a study conducted to determine the prevalence of scabies and impetigo in the rural villages of the Western Province in the Solomon Islands. The study found that scabies is a very common skin condition that affects people of all ages, with infants and young children being particularly vulnerable. The article also highlights the importance of proper diagnosis and treatment of scabies and impetigo to prevent the spread of these skin conditions.
We found a correlation between the proportion of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the brain of adult mice and the rate of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus. This correlation is likely due to shared genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2Ea locus which had a dominant influence on T cell subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. We also found that CD4+ T cells or subpopulations thereof mediate the effect. Our results suggest that the natural genetic variation that controls T cell development and homeostasis has a broader impact on hippocampal function than previously thought. Specifically, our findings suggest that adult neurogenesis may be involved in the known functions of the hippocampus, such as learning and memory, and may have additional roles that are as yet unknown.
Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi and is a major health problem in Latin America. We previously screened the T. cruzi sequence database and identified 71 potential vaccine candidates. We now report the development of a DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine (TcVac2) consisting of three antigen candidates (TcG1-TcG3) that were phylogenetically conserved in clinically important strains of T. cruzi, expressed in the infective and intracellular stages of the parasite, and elicited lytic antibody responses in immunized mice. We further tested the protective efficacy of TcVac2 in mice challenged with T. cruzi. The results suggest that TcVac2 induced robust antibody and cell-mediated immune responses against T. cruzi and provided protection from acute parasitemia and chronic parasite persistence and immunopathology in chagasic mice.
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disease with multiple genetic factors contributing to its pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed to compare different machine learning approaches for predicting T1D risk. We used the largest T1D dataset available, which includes ∼1, 500 samples from the 1958 British Birth Cohort, ∼1, 500 samples from the UK Blood Service Control Group, as well as ∼2, 000 samples each from the disease collections: type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , bipolar disorder ( BD ) , hypertension ( HT ) , coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , as previously described . We applied a support vector machine ( SVM ) algorithm, a widely used method in machine learning, for predicting T1D risk in three different case-control datasets. We also compared the performance of SVM with that of logistic regression ( LR ), a commonly used approach in genetic studies. We found that SVM performed better than LR in terms of both sensitivity and specificity. Our results suggest that SVM may be a useful tool for predicting T1D risk and for personalized medicine in T1D.
In this study, we examined the role of circulating memory CD8+ T cells in the response to skin viral infection. We found that memory CD8+ T cells from the circulation rapidly enter the skin following infection, regardless of their ability to survey peripheral lymph nodes. We also found that memory CD8+ T cells that enter the skin do not express CD103 and become functional CD69+/CD103- TRM following the resolution of viral infection. Furthermore, we found that the differentiation of memory CD8+ T cells to the TRM phenotype is dependent on the expression of genes that regulate tissue retention, including CD62L and KLRG1. Our findings highlight the importance of the tissue microenvironment in determining the fate of circulating memory CD8+ T cells following skin viral infection.
In this article, the authors describe how a specific protein is localized to either the axon or the dendrites of neurons. The axon is the long, slender part of a neuron that sends out signals to other neurons, while the dendrites are the branching parts that receive signals from other neurons. The authors show that a protein called Myosin VI is specifically localized to the dendrites of neurons, and they explain how they know this. They also show that another protein, Nav1.2, is specifically localized to the axon of neurons, and they explain how they know this as well. This information is important because it helps us understand how different parts of a neuron can have different properties, which is essential for how neurons work together to form networks in the brain.
In the animal kingdom, there are two main types of sex determination: genetic and environmental. In genetic sex determination, the sex of an individual is determined by genetic factors. In environmental sex determination, the sex of an individual is determined by environmental cues. Daphnia magna is a freshwater branchiopod crustacean that undergoes environmental sex determination. Recent studies have identified two Dsx genes in D. magna that play a role in the development of male and female traits. One of these genes, DapmaDsx1, is responsible for the male trait when expressed during environmental sex determination. The domain organization of DapmaDsx1 is similar to that of Dsx genes from insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. However, the molecular basis for sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaDsx1 is different from that of insects. During embryogenesis, expression of DapmaDsx1 is increased only in males and its transcripts are primarily detected in male-specific structures. Knock-down of DapmaDsx1 in male embryos results in the production of female traits including ovarian maturation, whereas ectopic expression of DapmaDsx1 in female embryos results in the development of male-like phenotypes. These results establish DapmaDsx1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype in D. magna. Our findings reveal how environmental sex determination is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component that is functionally conserved in animals using genetic sex determination. We infer that there is an ancient, previously unidentified link between genetic and environmental sex determination.
In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of a trivalent HSV-2 vaccine containing gC2, gD2 and gE2 subunit proteins in protecting rhesus macaques from vaginal challenge with HSV-2. The vaccine was designed to provide improved protection against HSV-2 by targeting multiple HSV-2 proteins that are important for virus entry and replication. The vaccine was formulated with CpG oligonucleotide and alum adjuvants to enhance immune responses. The results showed that the trivalent vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies against HSV-2, which were associated with a lower rate of vaginal shedding of HSV-2 DNA and lower levels of replication competent virus after challenge. The trivalent vaccine also provided better protection against genital lesions than the gD2 vaccine alone, which suggests that targeting multiple HSV-2 proteins can improve vaccine efficacy. Overall, these results demonstrate the potential of a trivalent HSV-2 vaccine containing gC2, gD2 and gE2 subunit proteins to provide improved protection against HSV-2 infection in humans.
Segmental duplications and other highly repetitive regions of the genome make it difficult to map protein-DNA interactions with ChIP-seq. Our research has developed a new analytical method, called Perm-seq, that can accurately allocate multi-mapping reads in these regions. We found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over methods that do not use additional data types. We applied Perm-seq to ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from 64 different factors and found many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. We also analyzed the sequence characteristics of these novel interactions and found that they shared overall sequence characteristics with protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions. Our research has important implications for the study of transcriptional regulation in repetitive regions of the genome.
This study explored the link between schistosomiasis, a parasitic worm infection, and HIV-1 transmission in Tanzania. The authors analyzed data from a population of adults living in seven villages in the Magu District, who were tested for HIV in 2007, 2010, and 2013. The study found that women with schistosome infection had a higher odds of becoming HIV-1-infected than those without. In addition, the study found that the odds of becoming HIV-1-infected were higher in women with S. haematobium infection than in those with S. mansoni infection. The study also found that individuals with active schistosome infection at the time of HIV-1 acquisition may have impaired immune control of HIV-1, resulting in higher HIV-1 viral loads at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion.
We discovered that rDNA copy number is altered in cancer genomes. Copy number changes can be both global and regional. We found that rDNA copy number is reduced in cancer genomes with mTOR activation. We also discovered co-occurring increased copy number of additional genes. These data suggest that rDNA copy number can be altered in a natural system. Additionally, we discovered that copy loss does not compromise proliferation, rRNA production, or protein synthesis in mouse HSCs. These findings provide evidence that rDNA copy number can be altered in a natural system and does not necessarily affect ribosome biogenesis.
We have reported an integrated approach to investigate bacterial growth dynamics in Salmonella Typhimurium infection. We followed the fate of eight wild-type isogenic tagged strains ( WITS ) in the spleen and liver of infected mice and their blood over the course of a systemic infection. By comparing the dynamics of each subpopulation at different body sites, we were able to dissect the determinants of net growth at different infection stages. Our results show that during the early phase of infection, bacteria replicate and grow in the organs via a homogeneous process, and spread between organs via a stochastic process, but after 24 h p.i., bacterial growth becomes heterogeneous, and spread between organs becomes more deterministic. We also found that components of the immune response affect spatiotemporal bacterial population dynamics. The methods developed in this study will facilitate our understanding of bacterial growth dynamics in other animal models of infection and will provide a paradigm shift in our understanding of the whole animal infection process.
In this paper, the authors propose a new approach to solving the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion perception. They suggest that local velocity constraints in combination with binocular disparity and other depth cues provide a more flexible framework for the solution of the inverse problem. In the context of the aperture problem, they derive predictions from two plausible default strategies and predict perceived motion directions for ambiguous line motion. Their theoretical results suggest that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are needed to solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. It seems plausible that motion and disparity input is processed in parallel and integrated late in the visual processing hierarchy.
The O-acetylation of alginate, a polysaccharide produced by cystic fibrosis patients, by P. aeruginosa enzymes is important for bacterial survival and persistence in the cystic fibrosis lung. The O-acetylation of alginate by P. aeruginosa enzymes is mediated by three enzymes: AlgX, AlgA, and AlgJ. AlgX and AlgA are O-acetyltransferases that transfer an acetyl group to the C6 carboxylic acid of alginate, while AlgJ is a ligase that seals the O-acetylated alginate chain. In this study, the crystal structure of P. aeruginosa AlgJ, AlgJ79–379, was determined. The structure revealed that AlgJ is a homodimer and that each monomer contains a domain at the N-terminus that is responsible for binding to the carbohydrate substrate and a C-terminal domain that is responsible for catalysis. The structure also revealed that the active site of AlgJ contains three conserved active site residues that are critical for the catalytic activity of AlgJ: one aspartate residue that serves as the base for the acetyl group, one histidine residue that serves as the proton acceptor for the acetyl group, and one tyrosine residue that is responsible for coordinating the acetyl group. The crystal structure of AlgJ79–379 was used to identify the binding site of AlgJ and to determine the substrate specificity of AlgJ. The binding site of AlgJ was determined to be a pocket located between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of AlgJ, and the crystal structure of AlgJ79–379 bound to the alginate oligosaccharide ManA4 was determined. The substrate specificity of AlgJ was found to be specific to alginate oligosaccharides containing a C6 carboxylic acid, and no catalytic activity was observed for AlgJ79–379 toward cellulose, starch, or other polysaccharides. The crystal structure of AlgJ79–379 was also used to identify amino acid residues that are critical for the catalytic activity of AlgJ. The results revealed that the active site residues Asp150, His209, and Tyr213 are critical for the catalytic activity of AlgJ. The crystal structure of AlgJ79–379 was also used to identify amino acid residues that are critical for the interaction of AlgJ with the alginate oligosaccharide. The results revealed that amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of AlgJ are critical for the interaction of AlgJ with the alginate oligosaccharide. The crystal structure of AlgJ79–379 was also used to identify amino acid residues that are critical for the interaction of AlgJ with AlgX. The results revealed that amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of AlgJ are critical for the interaction of AlgJ with AlgX. The crystal structure of AlgJ79–379 was also used to identify amino acid residues that are critical for the stability of the AlgJ homodimer. The results revealed that amino acid residues in the C-terminal domain of AlgJ are critical for the stability of the AlgJ homodimer. The crystal structure of AlgJ79–379 was also used to identify amino acid residues that are critical for the oligomerization of AlgJ. The results revealed that amino acid residues in the N-terminal domain of AlgJ are critical for the oligomerization of AlgJ. The crystal structure of AlgJ79–379 was also used to identify amino acid residues that are critical for the monomerization of AlgJ. The results revealed that amino acid residues in the C-terminal domain of AlgJ are critical for the monomerization of AlgJ. Overall, the crystal structure of AlgJ79–379 revealed important insights into the function and mechanism of AlgJ and provides a foundation for future studies of the O-acetylation of alginate by P. aeruginosa enzymes.
The phosphorylation of MAPKs is a key regulator of β(1,3)-glucan masking in the Candida albicans mutant lacking the major mannosyltransferase Cek1. We show that the Rho1 GTPase, which is a positive regulator of β(1,3)-glucan synthesis, is a downstream effector of Mkc1 and Cek1 MAPKs. The overexpression of Rho1 leads to increased unmasking of β(1,3)-glucan in C. albicans. This study provides insights into the regulation of β(1,3)-glucan masking and suggests a novel therapeutic target for antifungal agents.
This study is about understanding the causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. The authors performed a genome-wide association study of AD dementia and used neuropathologic data to analyze specific features of AD. The authors found that the known AD risk loci were associated with specific neuropathologic features of AD. The findings of this study could lead to a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of AD and related dementias.
This study aimed to analyze the kinetic role of urea in protein unfolding. To do so, the authors used molecular dynamics simulations with 30 different proteins representative of all native folds and in a range of force-fields. They found that the presence of urea stabilizes the unfolded state by slowing down the atomic-motion. Urea stickiness and slow diffusion are crucial for unfolding by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded microstates. Urea does not favor the formation of partially open microstates but is not a mere spectator of unfolding. The authors concluded that urea actively favors unfolding by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded microstates, slowly driving the protein conformational ensemble far from the native one.
This paper gives a review of the epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia. It includes data from studies published between January 2000 and February 2012. The paper describes the number of dengue fever cases, the geographical spread of the disease, and the age groups most affected by dengue disease. It also discusses the sentinel surveillance system for dengue disease in Colombia and the use of individual notification in the system since 2006. The paper highlights the importance of understanding the factors that determine disease expression and improving disease control and management.
Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease of the skin and mucosal tissues caused by Leishmania parasites. These parasites are transmitted by the bite of sandflies. The aim of this review is to summarize the frequency of TL coinfections in human populations, the interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and the implications of TL coinfections for clinical practice. For the purpose of this review, TL is defined as all forms of cutaneous (localised, disseminated, or diffuse) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. The most frequently studied coinfection is that between TL and HIV, in that the natural history of each of the two infections is modified by the presence of the other. Interactions between TL and infections other than HIV have not been comprehensively reviewed before. The objectives of the present review are to summarize the evidence about the (i) frequency of TL and coinfections other than HIV in human populations, (ii) interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and (iii) implications of TL coinfections for clinical practice. The authors searched medical literature to identify publications about TL and coinfections. For the purpose of this review, they defined TL as all forms of cutaneous (localised, disseminated, or diffuse) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. The authors also excluded HIV/AIDS and TL, skin manifestations caused by L. donovani and L. infantum/L. chagasi, and superinfection of TL lesions with gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. The authors used search terms indicating (groups of) infections, pathogens, and diseases caused by these pathogens. The detailed search strategy for MEDLINE is given in S1 File. Two reviewers extracted the data from the included records, and any doubts and discordances were resolved through discussion. The authors described the information the same way the authors of the original publications did, using mainly counts, proportions, and medians. The authors used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to prepare this review, but it was not possible to follow all the recommendations because PRISMA mainly focuses on the evaluation of healthcare interventions, and the authors' focus was broader than that. The PRISMA checklist is given in S1 List. The frequency of TL and coinfections other than HIV in human populations is not well known. Different studies report the frequency of coinfection with Trypanosoma cruzi in TL patients in Argentina and the frequency of helminthiasis in TL patients in Brazil. The mechanisms of interaction between different microorganisms are not clear. Diagnostic problems may occur when concurrent infections cause similar lesions, when different pathogens are present in the same lesions, or when similarities between phylogenetically close pathogens affect accuracy of diagnostic tests. Some coinfections (e.g., helminthiasis) appear to reduce the effectiveness of antileishmanial treatment, and drug combinations may cause cumulative adverse effects. Coinfection is frequent, it can lead to diagnostic errors and delays, and it can influence the effectiveness and safety of treatment. More research is needed to unravel how coinfections interfere with the pathogenesis of TL.
Natural genetic variation in MHC-I and -II genes affects CD4:CD8 T cell ratio and MHC class I expression in rats. We used genetic mapping to identify two QTLs that contributed to variation in MHC class I expression and T cell selection. The first QTL spanned 4.1–9.7 Mb on chromosome 20 and contributed to both the variation in MHC class I expression and CD4:CD8 T cell ratio. The second QTL, located on chromosome 11, contributed only to the variation in CD4:CD8 T cell ratio. We found that the variation in MHC class I expression correlated with alleles of the antigen processing gene Tap2. We also identified a new type of MHC class I modification that we termed inverse cim, which reduced the expression of TAP-B linked RT1-A molecules if associated with TAP-A. Finally, we showed that polymorphisms in Tap2 significantly contributed to CD8 lineage commitment, likely by altering the class-I peptide repertoire on antigen presenting cells in the thymus.
Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). The disease can be transmitted through the bite of a triatomine bug (the disease's natural reservoir) or through non-vectorial routes such as congenital transmission, blood transfusions, and solid organ transplants. Chagas disease is endemic in 21 Latin American countries, where it can cause heart and digestive problems. However, it is also appearing in non-endemic countries such as Spain, North America, and the Western Pacific Region, where it is often transmitted through population migration.
The paper describes a new algorithm called BlocBuster that can be used to identify combinations of genetic variants associated with complex diseases such as psoriasis. The algorithm works by constructing a network of genetic variants and testing the entire network for associations with the disease of interest. It uses a novel correlation coefficient that takes into account genetic heterogeneity to identify patterns of association that may be missed by traditional methods. The algorithm has been tested on psoriasis data and has identified a new pattern of genetic variants associated with the disease. The paper also provides a lay summary of the provided content.
Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH), and polymicrogyria (PMG) are a group of complex brain malformations resulting in significant developmental disability and seizures. Many patients with these malformations have autism spectrum disorder. To date, the genomic basis of these malformations remains unclear. This study investigated whether rare genomic copy number variants (CNVs) are enriched in patients with ACC, CBLH, and PMG compared to controls. Genomic DNA from 545 patients with one or more of these malformations and from 2,349 controls was analyzed using high-throughput SNP arrays. The study revealed that patients with ACC, CBLH, and PMG have a higher burden of rare genomic CNVs than controls, and that a significant percentage of them have large de novo likely pathogenic CNVs.
In this study, the authors examined the role of Yorkie, a key molecule of the Hippo signaling pathway, in the process of regeneration in planarian flatworms. The authors found that, when Yorkie is knocked down, the proliferative and transcriptional responses to injury are hyper-activated and prolonged. The authors also discovered novel wound-induced genes that were de-repressed in Yorkie-knocked-down animals. Additionally, the authors observed that in Yorkie-knocked-down animals, the sensing of the size of an injury by the eyes or the pharynx is not appropriate, and the brain, gut, and midline cannot remodel or scale correctly to the size of the regenerating fragment. Taken together, these findings suggest that Yorkie is a key molecule that integrates multiple aspects of the injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning.
The paper describes the upregulation of exosome production and specific miRNA loading in response to enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection of human cells. The authors also demonstrate that exosomes play a critical role in the transmission of EV71 infection between cells, by facilitating the delivery of viral RNA. The paper provides important insights into the host-pathogen interactions during EV71 infection, and highlights the potential role of exosomes in the pathogenesis of HFMD.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the maintenance of dopaminergic neurons. Recent studies have identified two genes associated with early-onset autosomal recessive PD, PINK1 and parkin, which are involved in regulating mitochondrial homeostasis. To better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between PINK1 and parkin, a study was conducted to identify proteins that bind to PINK1. The results revealed that PGAM5, a mitochondrial protein, modulates the PINK1 pathway, negatively regulates the PINK1 pathway related to mitochondrial maintenance, and acts between PINK1 and parkin or independently of parkin downstream of PINK1. The study provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis by PINK1 and parkin.
Buruli ulcer is a skin disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans, which produces a toxin that kills cells and impairs the immune system. Interferon-γ is a protein that helps cells fight infection and may be important in defending against Buruli ulcer. To investigate the role of interferon-γ in defending against Buruli ulcer, scientists infected mice with M. ulcerans and compared the progression of the infection in mice that lacked interferon-γ to those that had normal amounts of it. They found that mice that lacked interferon-γ had faster-growing infections and more tissue damage than mice that had normal amounts of it, suggesting that interferon-γ plays an important role in protecting against Buruli ulcer.
The provided content explains the model for electron transport in the complex III of mitochondrial electron transport chain. The model is based on kinetic equations that describe the reactions of electron transport, including the electron exchange between complex III subunits, the electron exchange between complex III and cytochrome c, and the electron transport from complex III to complex IV. The model is capable of simulating the effect of various substrates on electron transport in complex III, including succinate and pyruvate. The model is also capable of simulating the effect of different redox states on electron transport in complex III. The model is implemented in a computer program that can be used to simulate electron transport in complex III under different conditions.
This article describes the analysis of the protein expression pattern of the Drosophila gap gene Hkb during early embryogenesis. Hkb is an important regulatory gene in the gap gene network, which is responsible for the segmentation of the Drosophila embryo. The authors use a novel, integrated approach to characterize the regulatory role of Hkb in the gap gene network. They use a large set of expression data for various gap gene products to construct a new gap gene circuit model, which includes Hkb as a regulatory factor. They use this model to test different hypotheses about the regulatory role of Hkb and to make predictions about the dynamics of gap gene expression during embryogenesis. The authors also use the model to test the reliability of different methods for parameter estimation and to identify potential sources of error in the model. Overall, this article provides a detailed and rigorous analysis of the regulatory role of Hkb in the gap gene network and demonstrates the utility of integrated, hybrid modeling approaches for the study of complex biological systems.
This article describes the use of phage lysates as an alternative to heat or chemical inactivation of Brucella abortus S19 and RB51 vaccines for immunotherapy of bovine brucellosis. The phage lysates were prepared by optimizing the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of the phage to bacteria ratio. The immunotherapy was performed on 21 adult cattle, and the response was evaluated by measuring the immune response, such as total leukocyte count (TLC), differential leukocyte count (DLC), and interferon gamma production by in vitro restimulation of leukocytes from immunized cattle. The article also describes the use of Brucella-specific RNA in plasma as a biomarker to monitor the effect of therapy in a non-destructive and minimally invasive manner. Overall, this study provides a promising new approach to the treatment of bovine brucellosis.
CDKs are proteins that control cell division in eukaryotic cells. They can be activated by signals from damaged or unreplicated DNA, and they also play a role in the DNA damage response. In mammals, Cdk2 is active throughout S and G2 phases, but it is not required for survival because other CDKs can compensate for its absence. Scientists have used chemical genetics to study the function of Cdk2 in protecting genomic integrity and to uncover a non-redundant requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage. They have identified a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA damage response machinery and have shown that by chemical genetics, they can uncover functions of specific CDKs that were missed by gene knockout and RNAi studies.
In this study, the authors used the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) method to map open chromatin regions in megakaryocytic and erythroblastic cell lines. They then compared the patterns of open chromatin between these two cell lines and identified specific regions of open chromatin that are cell type-specific. The authors also used the FAIRE method to identify specific genomic regions that harbor genetic variants that fall into regions of open chromatin specific to either megakaryocytic or erythroblastic cell lines. They validated their findings by performing in vitro assays to study the functional relevance of these variants to the phenotype of interest. Overall, the authors provide valuable insight into the cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms that underlie complex traits and disease.
This study compares the effects of blockade of a persistent sodium current (INaP) in respiratory neurons via two different mechanisms: pore obstruction mediated by tetrodotoxin (TTX) and altered inactivation dynamics mediated by riluzole. The results of the simulations match a wide array of experimental data, including the diversity of experimental results from in vitro studies of INaP block, the seemingly contradictory effects of experimental application of TTX and riluzole in respiratory circuits, and the failure of RZ application to effectively block INaP in the intact respiratory network. The simulations suggest that RZ application may fail to effectively block INaP in the intact respiratory network due to the specific mechanism of action of RZ. The study also provides a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory experimental results from in vitro studies of INaP block, and the authors suggest that the effects of INaP block in in vitro preparations are not necessarily equivalent to those in more intact preparations. The results of this study demonstrate that the specific mechanism of action of a pharmacological blocker can differentially impact neuronal and circuit activity, and that different blockade mechanisms can have different functional implications.
This article describes the role of miR-218 in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. MiR-218 expression is decreased along with the expression of its host gene, Slit3, in metastatic GC. Robo1, one of several Slit receptors, is negatively regulated by miR-218, thus establishing a negative feedback loop. Decreased miR-218 levels eliminate Robo1 repression, which activates the Slit-Robo1 pathway, triggering tumor metastasis. The restoration of miR-218 suppresses Robo1 expression and inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. The authors also report that miR-218 is closely correlated with GC tumorigenesis and metastasis in patients. Furthermore, they discovered an intriguing negative feedback loop involving Slit, miR-218, and Robo1, in which miR-218 can be derived from either of two genes located in the introns of two distinct members of the Slit protein family.
We used a mouse model with a genetic switch to lower plasma lipoproteins and studied the effects of plasma cholesterol-lowering on atherosclerosis development. We found that cholesterol-lowering prevented the formation of advanced plaques and identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes. We validated their role by siRNA-inhibition in macrophages incubated with acetylated-LDL, revealing a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-ester accumulation.
In this paper, the authors developed a simple, quantitative, and high-throughput assay to screen for E. coli mutants with envelope biogenesis defects. They used this assay to identify 102 genes of unknown function that may be involved in envelope biogenesis. As a proof of principle, they characterized one of these genes, ElyC, and found that it plays a critical role in the metabolism of essential lipids used for envelope biogenesis. The authors suggest that further analysis of the function of these hits is likely to uncover a wealth of new information about the biogenesis of the Gram-negative envelope and its vulnerabilities. They also propose that the screening assay described here should be adaptable to other organisms to study the biogenesis of different envelope architectures.
A group of researchers developed a method to combine data from multiple sources to create a single, complete picture of the interactions between different variables. They used the example of the Drosophila embryo to test their approach and found that it could successfully fuse data from multiple sources into a complete picture of the embryo's development. They believe their method can be used to study other developing tissues.
The study aimed to compare the localization of SVMPs from different classes in the tissue of the mouse cremaster muscle after ex vivo injection. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that PII and PIII SVMPs showed a close association with capillaries and post-capillary venules, while PI SVMP was more widely distributed in the tissue. In addition, different patterns of degradation of ECM components were observed for the three classes of SVMPs. These findings suggest that PII and PIII SVMPs have a greater hemorrhagic potential than PI SVMPs.
The expression of the homeotic gene abd-A in Drosophila embryos has been analyzed. In particular, the role of the iab-8 ncRNA in the repression of abd-A in the posterior central nervous system (CNS) has been investigated. The iab-8 ncRNA is transcribed in the 8th and 9th abdominal segments (parasegments 13 and 14) in a distal-to-proximal direction, and is processed into a 90 kb-long transcript. The transcript is required for repression of abd-A in the posterior CNS. This repression occurs through both transcriptional interference and the production of a micro RNA. The iab-8 ncRNA is also required for fertility in both males and females.
This study uses a theoretical model to investigate two distinct types of focal seizure onset patterns, which are characterized by low and high amplitude oscillations, respectively. The model is based on the concept of excitability, which refers to the propensity of a neural population to generate seizure activity. The model suggests that the low amplitude onset pattern is characterized by a gradual increase in excitability, while the high amplitude onset pattern is characterized by a sudden increase in excitability. The model also suggests that surgical outcomes may depend on the excitability of the tissue surrounding the seizure core. The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding the onset mechanisms of focal seizures and may inform the development of new therapies for epilepsy.
Maize pollen tube development is a complex process involving interactions between the female and male gametes. Pollen tube growth is dependent on extracellular signals, such as cytokinins, which are synthesized by the ovary and transported to the pollen tube. In this study, we show that maize pollen tubes contain a family of four genes encoding for a putative novel extracellular signal-regulated protease (ZmES1-4). These proteins were expressed in pollen tubes in a stage- and tissue-specific manner. Additionally, we found that ZmES4 was localized in the apical region of the pollen tube and was involved in pollen tube growth. These results provide important insights into the mechanisms that regulate pollen tube development in maize.
Herpes simplex virus ( HSV-1 ) is being investigated for oncolytic therapy as it can be modified genetically to target cancer cells. We have retargeted HSV-1 to HER-2 oncoprotein, which is overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancer. We assessed the efficacy of systemically i . p . delivered R-LM249 against disseminated tumors in mouse models of human tumors. R-LM249 strongly inhibited carcinomatosis in ovarian cancer mouse models and growth of ovarian metastases of breast cancer cells. Brain metastases were also reduced. Cumulatively, the HER-2-retargeted oncolytic HSV effectively reduced the growth of ovarian and breast carcinoma disseminated to the peritoneal cavity.
A recent study in the journal Science has revealed that a small region of yeast DNA called the C-terminal region of Sfi1 is essential for the proper functioning of the yeast mitotic spindle. The authors of the study used a series of mutations to determine which part of the Sfi1 protein is crucial for mitotic spindle formation, and they found that the C-terminal region is absolutely required. They also discovered that a specific group of residues within the C-terminal region of Sfi1 is responsible for regulating the number of spindles that are formed. The authors conclude that their findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which mitotic spindles are formed and regulated.
In this study, we used a humanized mouse model to investigate the role of HIV-1's Vpr protein in infection in vivo. Vpr is a viral protein encoded by HIV-1 that plays a role in increasing viral replication and depleting a specific subset of T cells called regulatory T cells (Tregs). We found that Vpr causes Treg depletion and enhances virus production in CCR5-tropic HIV-1-infected mice, but not in CXCR4-tropic HIV-1-infected mice. This suggests that Vpr takes advantage of CCR5+ proliferating CD4+ T cells, including Tregs, for enhancing virus replication in acute infection. We also found that treatment with denileukin diftitox (DD), a drug that depletes Tregs, enhanced the activation/proliferation of memory CD4+ T cells and rendered them more susceptible to CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection. This suggests that Tregs exist in a higher cycling state than other T cell subsets, making them more vulnerable to exploitation by Vpr during acute HIV-1 infection. Overall, our findings suggest that Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating CCR5-tropic HIV-1 propagation during acute infection by utilizing CCR5+ proliferating CD4+ T cells, including Tregs.
The authors studied the genetic structure of vivax malaria parasites in South Korea using microsatellite DNA markers. They analyzed 14 microsatellite DNA loci of 163 South Korean isolates collected from 1994 to 2008. They found that there was a gradual decrease in linkage disequilibrium levels over time and that genetic differentiation between successive years was also decreasing. They also found that a drastic genetic change occurred in 2002 and 2003. While they couldn't find clear evidence of relapse or asymptomatic parasite carriage, they speculated that the parasites were being continually introduced into South Korea through other parasite population sources, such as North Korea. They concluded that molecular epidemiology using microsatellite DNA of the P . vivax population is effective for assessing the population structure and temporal dynamics of parasite transmission in endemic areas.
Introns, which are sections of DNA that are removed during the process of splicing in eukaryotic cells, play an important role in regulating gene expression. In particular, introns that are splicing-competent, meaning that they are able to be spliced from a mRNA transcript, are thought to enhance the transcription of the mRNA that they are part of. The authors of this study have found that this enhancement is dependent on a phenomenon called 'gene looping', where the promoter and terminator regions of a gene come into close proximity with each other, and that this gene looping confers directionality to the transcription of the gene. The authors demonstrate this by analyzing the effects of mutations in the splicing machinery and the termination factors of a yeast gene on the transcription directionality of that gene. They show that the mutations cause a loss of gene looping and directionality, suggesting that the two are linked.
IGF2 gene and its promoters are subject to epigenetic regulation in pigs and mice. Transcriptional regulation is especially important for the growth and development of organisms. IGF2 is known to play a critical role in growth and development, and it is involved in a wide range of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. The IGF2 gene encodes for a protein called insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2), which is a member of the insulin family of growth factors. IGF2 has several isoforms, and the most common isoform is a single-nucleotide difference between exon 3 and exon 5 of the IGF2 gene. This single-nucleotide difference is known as a quantitative trait nucleotide (QTN), and it has a profound effect on the expression of the IGF2 gene. The QTN is present in a large fraction of the pig population and is associated with several phenotypes, including increased muscle mass, decreased heart size, and increased fat mass. The QTN is also present in mice, and it has a similar effect on the expression of the IGF2 gene. In this study, we used mass spectrometry to identify a protein that interacts with the ZBED6 transcription factor in pigs. We also used RNA interference and transient transfection to study the role of ZBED6 in IGF2 gene expression and the phenotypes associated with the QTN. Our results suggest that ZBED6 is a novel protein that is involved in IGF2 gene regulation and that it plays a critical role in the phenotypes associated with the QTN.
We present a comprehensive study of the RNA editing landscape in the rhesus macaque. Using next generation sequencing data and stringent filtering criteria, we identify and verify 5,612 A-to-G RNA editing sites in coding and non-coding regions of seven tissues derived from the same animal. These editing sites are highly conserved between macaque and human and are associated with ADAR-mediated RNA editing. We also show that RNA editing is shaped by purifying selection in coding regions, leading to increased functional conservation in RNA editing sites. Our study provides a foundation for future studies of the regulatory and functional roles of RNA editing in rhesus macaque and other non-human primates.
Scientists have studied how our brain makes decisions when we see things. In the past, it has been found that our brain pools information from many neurons to make a decision. However, not all neurons are equally useful or relevant to the decision. To make a good decision, the brain needs to use only the information from the neurons that are most useful and relevant. It also needs to use this information very carefully. This means that the brain needs to weigh the information from each neuron and then combine the information to make a final decision. Scientists have studied this process by creating special visual stimuli that can be detected or discriminated in different ways. They found that the brain does not always use the information from each neuron perfectly, and that it sometimes uses the information from neurons that are not very relevant to the decision. They think that this happens because the brain is not always able to weigh the information carefully enough. They want to learn more about this process and how the brain makes decisions.
Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small RNA molecules that play a crucial role in protecting the germline genome from transposable elements (TEs). In this study, we found that piRNA loci are autonomous transcriptional units that produce small RNAs independently of a larger piRNA cluster. Each piRNA locus encodes only one piRNA, which is sufficient to produce sufficient piRNA to defend the genome against TEs. The study provides a deeper understanding of the function of piRNA loci in TE defense and has implications for the understanding of piRNA biogenesis and function in other species.
Brucella abortus is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes undulant fever, or melittoma, in humans and is a zoonotic disease transmitted to humans by infected animals, particularly goats, sheep, and cattle. Brucella abortus replicates inside of host cells, primarily HeLa cells. Previous research has indicated that Brucella abortus modulates the UPR to survive within the host cell. In this study, the authors found that Brucella abortus activates the UPR via the IRE1 pathway to acquire an ER-derived membrane for its replication. They also found that Yip1A, which regulates the activation of IRE1, is a pivotal host factor for Brucella abortus to establish its ER-derived safe replication niche. The authors suggest that host factors that are involved in ER-Golgi vesicular transport pathways may contribute to the intracellular life of Brucella abortus.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of the Vps34 PI3K in tombusvirus replication. They show that Vps34 is required for the efficient replication of tombusviruses in yeast and plant cells. The authors also demonstrate that Vps34 is directly involved in the replication of tombusviruses by interacting with the p33 replication protein and recruiting PE to peroxisomes or mitochondria. Additionally, the authors show that inhibition of Vps34 PI3K activity using AS604850 or Wortmannin leads to a reduction in tombusviral RNA accumulation. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanisms of tombusvirus replication and highlights the potential of targeting Vps34 PI3K as a therapeutic approach against tombusvirus infections.
Dengue fever is a common, potentially life-threatening disease caused by the dengue virus. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, and research on how well mosquitoes transmit the virus is important for understanding and controlling dengue fever outbreaks. In this study, we compared different methods for feeding mosquitoes with blood from dengue fever patients. We found that mosquitoes fed directly on patients' blood were more likely to become infected and transmit the virus to other mosquitoes than mosquitoes fed on blood that had been treated in some way. We also found that the severity of the patient's illness affected the ability of mosquitoes to become infected and transmit the virus. These findings suggest that direct feeding of mosquitoes with blood from dengue fever patients may be the most accurate way to study the transmission of the dengue virus.
A new study by Tatewaki et al. has identified genetic variants associated with resistance to topoisomerase II poisons in C. elegans. The authors used a combination of genome-wide association mapping and fine mapping to identify variants in the topoisomerase II gene and its regulatory regions that are associated with resistance to topoisomerase II poisons. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of resistance to these drugs and highlights the potential of C. elegans as a model organism for understanding and developing new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.
This study provides a detailed summary of the evolution of longevity in African mole-rats, particularly focusing on naked mole-rat, Ansell’s mole-rat and greater cane rat. The authors examine the genomes and transcriptomes of African mole-rats to identify genes that have evolved under positive selection, and which may be involved in their exceptionally long lifespans. The study identifies several genes that show signs of positive selection in African mole-rats, including those involved in the regulation of the mTOR pathway, cellular respiration, metal ion homeostasis and inflammation. These findings suggest that African mole-rats have evolved unique mechanisms for regulating aging and longevity.
The manuscript describes an approach to control the mosquito Ae. albopictus, a vector for DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV, by introducing a Wolbachia strain into the mosquito population. The introduced strain, wMel, has been previously shown to reduce the vector competence of DENV in D. melanogaster. The authors obtained a transinfected line of Ae. albopictus by injecting eggs with the wMel Wolbachia strain and outcrossing the obtained line with wPip Wolbachia-cured Ae. albopictus. The resulting transinfected line, ARwP-M, showed a 100% maternal inheritance of the wMel infection and high fitness, but its competence for DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV transmission was not significantly reduced compared to that of ARwP, the parental line. The authors propose that their approach could be used to replace wild populations of Ae. albopictus with a transinfected population, which would be refractory to DENV, CHIKV, and ZIKV transmission.
In this manuscript, we present a computational method that predicts motif-binding domains based on 3D structural information. We used a dataset of known peptide-mediated interactions to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, which was then applied to predict novel DMIs from a set of high-resolution 3D protein complex structures. We validated our predictions by searching for matches in interactome datasets and by visual inspection of the 3D structures. Our results provide a list of novel peptide-binding domains along with their respective high-resolution 3D structures and consensus motifs. These predictions can be used to guide protein engineering experiments and to identify new drug targets.
The paper titled "Environmental enteropathy in Lusaka, Zambia: cellular mechanisms of impaired barrier function and protective factors" explores the mechanisms of impaired barrier function in environmental enteropathy (EE) and protective factors that mitigate this damage in adults from Lusaka, Zambia. Environmental enteropathy is a condition that results from exposure to environmental factors such as poor sanitation, leading to damage to the small intestine, impaired nutrient absorption, and increased susceptibility to infections. In this study, the authors used a combination of confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE), histology, and immunohistochemistry to assess the damage to the small intestine, and mRNA sequencing of small intestinal biopsies to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of this damage. The authors found that EE is associated with increased epithelial shedding and a reduction in the expression of tight junction proteins, which are critical for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier. They also found that microbial translocation, the movement of bacteria and their products into the bloodstream, was significantly correlated with increased epithelial shedding and reduced tight junction protein expression. In addition, the authors found that the zinc uptake test was attenuated in 64% of individuals, indicating a reduction in micronutrient absorption, and that this was associated with HIV status but positively correlated with GLP-2, a protective peptide. The authors concluded that environmental enteropathy is associated with impaired barrier function and that further elucidation of the pathways involved in this damage is of considerable importance.
Researchers have identified a protein called p28 that blocks the re-infection of host cells by the same or highly similar viruses. This phenomenon, called superinfection exclusion, has been observed with a variety of animal and plant viruses, including human and animal pathogenic viruses and plant viruses. The researchers found that p28 expressed from a replicon exerts strong superinfection exclusion to a different replicon. This repressive activity is weakened by N-terminal modifications and enhanced by C-terminally fused epitope tags or fluorescent proteins. The researchers also found that p28-mediated superinfection exclusion is caused by the formation of multimeric p28 complexes that intercept new p28 monomers translated from superinfector genomes. This research could help develop new targets for antiviral therapy.
In this study, the authors investigate the combination of two different DNA vaccines to enhance long-term protective immunity against Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas' disease. They find that co-administration of DNA vaccines encoding both TS and IL-15 enhances long-term CD8+ T cell responses and protective T . cruzi immunity in mice ( >6 months post vaccination ) after vaccination with a combination of DNA vaccines encoding both TS and IL-15 . These findings suggest that combining different DNA vaccines may be a useful strategy to enhance protective immunity against pathogens.
This study identifies the Cullin4-based ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4WDR1 as a key regulator of the T. brucei PLK kinase. CRL4WDR1 binds to T. brucei PLK, which leads to the degradation of T. brucei PLK through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The degradation of T. brucei PLK is critical for the proper localization of T. brucei PLK in the basal body and bilobe, and is important for the correct segregation of the basal body in the cell cycle. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms by which the level of T. brucei PLK is regulated during the cell cycle.
We have identified the genes that are differentially expressed in Ddx3xfl/y and Ddx3yfl/y mice. These genes are involved in the immune response and include genes associated with T-cell activation, natural killer cell activity, and cytokine signaling. We have also found that Ddx3yfl/y mice are more susceptible to Listeria infection than Ddx3xfl/y mice, and this susceptibility is associated with lower levels of type I interferon production. Our findings suggest that Ddx3x and Ddx3y have different functions in the immune response.
The article describes a mathematical model of the olfactory receptor neuron in the male moth. The model takes into account all the processes involved in the generation of the receptor potential, which is the electrical signal that the neuron produces in response to an odor molecule. The model focuses on the main chemical and electrical processes that occur after the odor molecule binds to the receptor on the surface of the neuron. These processes include the production of second messengers (IP3 and DAG) in the neuron, the opening and closing of a series of ion channels (IP3-gated Ca2+ channel, DAG-gated cationic channel, Ca2+-gated Cl− channel, and Ca2+- and voltage-gated K+ channel), and the extrusion of Ca2+ from the neuron. The authors used a combination of experimental and theoretical data to create the model, and then used the model to make predictions about how the receptor potential would respond to different concentrations of odor molecules. They tested these predictions against experimental data and found that the model accurately predicted the shape and amplitude of the receptor potential. The authors conclude that their model provides a quantitative description of the main chemical and electrical processes that occur in the olfactory receptor neuron in response to an odor molecule.
The study explores the relationship between p53 binding and the chromatin context, as well as the impact of evolutionary constraints on p53 binding sites. The authors utilized ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data to identify p53 binding sites, and used chromatin state data from ENCODE and PhyloP scores to analyze the relationship between p53 binding and chromatin context. They also compared the evolutionary conservation of p53 binding sites with other regions of the genome, and found that p53 binding sites are less conserved than other regions of the genome. The study provides important insights into the factors that influence p53 binding, and may help inform future research on p53 and its role in DNA damage response.
Two-component signaling systems have been found to have a wide variety of sensory systems that are built around a core phosphotransfer reaction between histidine kinases (HKs) and their output response regulators (RRs) . This study focuses on a particular motif within these systems where a single HK can phosphotransfer reversibly to two separate RRs. The authors have found that this motif can allow rapid signal termination and a sigmoidal signal-response relationship. These findings have important implications for understanding the response dynamics of bacterial and yeast cells and suggest that these systems can be used as a basis for designing synthetic systems. The study demonstrates the power of combining mathematical modeling and experimental techniques to understand the complex dynamics of biological systems.
The authors of this study investigate the variation in expression of genes within a population of isogenic cells responding to the stressor sodium chloride. They identify a group of genes that are induced in response to the stress and another group that is repressed. They then investigate the regulation of these two groups of genes and find that their expression is regulated by different mechanisms. Finally, they investigate the role of two transcription factors in regulating the expression of these two groups of genes.
The paper you provided is a scientific article on the presence of trypanosomes in the mouse reproductive system. It reports the findings of a study that was done to determine if trypanosomes are present in the male reproductive organs of mice and if so, where they are located. The study was done through the use of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and histopathological analysis. The results of the study showed that trypanosomes are present in the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and testis of mice. They also found that the parasites are associated with severe tissue damage and rupture of epididymal ducts, which may be related to reduced fertility. The paper also mentions that a similar study was done in rats, guinea pigs, and rabbits and found that trypanosomes accumulated in the same organs. The authors suggest that these findings may have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of trypanosomiasis in humans and animals.
Chemical cues play a crucial role in many aspects of life, including food selection, mate choice, and predator avoidance. To respond to these cues, animals have evolved large families of chemosensory genes that encode receptors for different odorants and tastants. These receptors are expressed in different parts of the body, including the antennae, proboscis, and gustatory organs. To understand how these genes are regulated in response to different environmental conditions, the authors used Drosophila melanogaster as a model. They constructed microarrays to measure the expression of over 100 chemosensory genes and compared their expression in different developmental stages, sexes, and environmental conditions. They found that genes encoding different types of chemosensory receptors are expressed independently and that certain genes are particularly sensitive to environmental changes. They also found that groups of genes undergo coordinated changes in expression in response to different environmental conditions. These findings provide insight into how chemosensory genes are regulated and how they contribute to the diverse behaviors that animals exhibit in response to their chemical environment.
The study of crossover-associated proteins in human fetal oocytes can help researchers better understand how human trisomies occur. The presence of these proteins on meiotic chromosomes can indicate whether they are involved in the formation of nondisjunction-prone crossover configurations. This study aimed to analyze the number and location of crossover-associated proteins (such as MLH1) on nondisjunction-prone chromosomes in human fetal oocytes. By using immunofluorescence methodology, the researchers were able to directly examine the meiotic recombination process in the human female. The results of the study indicate that the number of MLH1 foci is lower than predicted from genetic linkage analysis, but its localization pattern conforms to that expected for a crossover-associated protein. The analysis of individual chromosomes provides evidence for the presence of “vulnerable” crossover configurations in the fetal oocyte, consistent with the idea that these are subsequently translated into nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of how human trisomies occur and how they can be prevented.
Insect bites are a major source of human disease, and how the body responds to the bites can have a significant impact on how the disease spreads. In this study, we used mathematical models to understand how the body's response to insect bites can affect the spread of disease in a population. We found that if the body's response to insect bites includes producing an immune response that lasts longer after the bite, this can have a significant effect on how quickly a disease spreads. Our findings suggest that interventions that target the mosquitoes that spread malaria, such as insecticide spraying, may be more effective if they are combined with strategies that encourage the development of an immune response in the people who are bitten.
The aim of this work was to analyze the differences in the proteome of amastigotes (the infective form of Leishmania) derived from mice with different immune responses to infection with the parasite. We compared the proteome of amastigotes derived from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice. The BALB/c nude mice lack T lymphocytes, which are important effector cells in the immune response against Leishmania. The comparative analysis of the proteomes of amastigotes from these two mice strains revealed the existence of 46 differentially expressed proteins. Among these proteins, many enzymes involved in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, and lipids were identified. Interestingly, many of these enzymes have been previously described as virulence factors of Leishmania. Additionally, the immunogenic proteins were identified and the majority of them have been previously described as immunogenic or immunosuppressive proteins of Leishmania. Our results suggest that the absence of T lymphocytes in BALB/c nude mice may cause alterations in the parasite proteome and affect the immunogenicity of proteins. These results contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the immune response to Leishmania infection and may help to develop new therapeutic strategies.
In this study, the authors investigate the subcellular localization and stability of the enzyme AID, which is important for the diversification of immunoglobulin genes. The authors use a variety of approaches, including live-cell imaging and lentiviral transduction, to determine the role of cell cycle in regulating AID activity and abundance. They find that AID is more stable in the nucleus during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and that mutations that affect AID's catalytic activity can alter its stability and abundance. The authors also demonstrate the use of novel cell cycle regulators to control AID's localization and activity, and show that these approaches can be used to engineer genes more efficiently. Overall, this study provides important insights into the regulation of AID activity and its role in diversifying immunoglobulin genes.
The study of microbial degradation of plant biomass is important for understanding the carbon cycle and producing biofuels. The authors investigated the enzyme machinery used by a plant-feeding clostridium, C. phytofermentans, to degrade and metabolize plant polysaccharides. They performed growth assays on different substrates to identify the types of polysaccharides that the bacteria can metabolize. They also performed RNA sequencing to identify which genes are up-regulated in response to each substrate and used this information to construct a model of how the bacteria degrade and metabolize plant polysaccharides. The authors also cloned and purified a set of enzymes involved in plant polysaccharide degradation and tested their ability to bind and cleave different polysaccharides. Finally, the authors used these enzymes in combination to test synergies in plant polysaccharide degradation. Overall, this study provides a better understanding of the enzyme machinery used by plant-feeding microbes to degrade and metabolize plant polysaccharides.
This article describes the results of a midterm evaluation of the integrated lymphatic filariasis (LF) and onchocerciasis elimination program in Sierra Leone. The study was conducted by the National NTD Control Programme and involved the collection of 6000 blood samples from 12 rural districts that had conducted three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) against LF. The results showed that the prevalence of LF in these districts had decreased significantly from 12.7% at baseline to 1.5% after three rounds of MDA. The study also reported a high coverage of MDA in the districts, with more than 95% of the population receiving treatment in each of the 12 districts. The results of this study suggest that integrated MDA against LF and onchocerciasis is effective in reducing the prevalence of LF in low endemicity areas of Sierra Leone. The study also highlights the importance of accurate and timely data collection and analysis in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of integrated MDA against LF and onchocerciasis.
In this paper, the authors propose a new method to estimate correlations in genomic survey data, which are commonly used to study the diversity of microbial communities in various environments. The authors show that the standard method for computing correlations from genomic survey data (GSD) is not valid because it assumes that the observed data are independent when in fact they are not. They demonstrate that the compositional nature of GSD can lead to widespread and severe biases in the estimation of correlations, and that these biases can be particularly severe when the diversity of the samples is low. The authors propose a new method called SparCC (https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc) to overcome these biases and estimate accurate correlations from GSD. The authors also show that SparCC is more accurate than the standard method when applied to real data from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), and that it can detect many more true interactions than the standard method. They also show that SparCC is more robust to changes in diversity and to noise in the data. The authors conclude that SparCC is a powerful tool for studying the complex inner workings of microbial communities and that it can provide valuable insights into the relationships between different components of these communities.
This article describes a study investigating the role of lysozyme resistance in the colonization of the upper airway by Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus). The study found that mutations in genes encoding enzymes that affect pneumococcal lysozyme resistance, specifically PgdA and Adr, increased sensitivity to lysozyme in vitro and reduced colonization of mice. Additionally, the study showed that purified pneumococcal cell walls were resistant to hydrolysis by lysozyme. These findings suggest that resistance to lysozyme contributes to the ability of pneumococcus to colonize the upper airway and evade clearance by phagocytic cells.
Dengue virus (DENV) causes a severe and potentially fatal disease known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). In Brazil, there were more than 5,900 cases of DHF and 874 deaths from DENV infection from 1986 to 2002. DENV infection is confirmed by detecting the virus in cell cultures, by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA, or by detecting DENV-specific antibodies. The DENV nonstructural 1 (NS1) antigen is abundant in the serum of patients in the early phase of infection and is useful in the diagnosis of dengue infection. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as a diagnostic technique for detecting DENV antigens in human tissue specimens. The study used tissue samples from 23 confirmed dengue fatal cases that occurred in 2002 in Brazil. The results showed that the Dengue Early ELISA detected NS1 in 22.9% of the specimens analyzed, the Platelia NS1 in 45.9%, and the rapid test NS1 Ag Strip in 78.3%. The NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive in liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, and thymus when compared to the other two ELISA assays. The study concluded that the DENV NS1 capture assay is a rapid and valuable approach for postmortem dengue confirmation and can be useful in identifying new tools for disease surveillance.
The study compared genetic differences between African American and Caucasian multiple myeloma patients based on self-reported race and genetic ancestry. The study used whole exome sequencing and copy number variation data from 721 treatment-naive bone marrow derived multiple myeloma cases. The study found significantly higher mutation frequencies in BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2 in African American cases. These genes are all involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. The study also found significantly lower mutation frequencies of TP53 and IRF4 in Caucasian cases. This study provides rationale for interrogating diverse tumor cohorts to best understand tumor genomics across populations.
This article provides a mathematical framework for studying the clonal expansion of passenger mutations in tumors. The authors focus on mutations that are subclonal, meaning that they do not fix in the entire population of cells in the tumor. They use a birth-death process to model the stochastic expansion of the population of cells that carry each passenger mutation. They then use this framework to study the likelihood of different tree structures involving passenger mutations, which can provide information about the evolutionary relationships between mutations. They also study the probability distribution for the number of subclonal mutations present in a tumor, which can be used as a molecular clock or to infer information about the birth and death rates of cells in the tumor. Overall, this article provides a useful mathematical framework for understanding the dynamics of passenger mutations in tumors.
Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects the motor system. HD is caused by an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat in the huntingtin gene, leading to the production of a mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) that contains an expanded polyQ region. mHtt aggregates into inclusions in neurons, which are thought to be toxic and to contribute to neuronal degeneration. The study of mHtt aggregation has provided insights into the mechanism of amyloid formation and has led to the identification of potential therapeutic targets.
CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are genetic sequences found in bacteria and archaea that provide defense against viruses and plasmids. CRISPR loci are made up of direct repeats and spacer sequences derived from foreign DNA. There are 64 known CRISPRs and 86 novel CRISPRs in human microbiome datasets. We developed a targeted assembly strategy to efficiently and comprehensively identify and characterize these CRISPRs in metagenomic sequences. By using metaCRT and CRISPRAlign, we identified repeats in long DNA sequences and detected CRISPRs in target sequences, respectively. We then selected a subset of known and novel CRISPRs that meet certain criteria and used SOAPdenovo to assemble reads containing these repeats into contigs. The exact boundaries of the repeats and spacers were determined using CRISPRAlign. We also simulated short reads from reference genomes and used our approach to assemble known CRISPRs in these genomes.
The article is about a study that examined whether the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has a circadian clock. The study used genome-wide expression profiling experiments to identify oscillating transcripts in C. elegans that are entrained to light or temperature cycles. These transcripts exhibited rhythmic expression with temperature-compensated 24-h periods, and their expression was sustained under constant conditions, suggesting that they are under circadian regulation. The study also demonstrated that light and temperature cycles strongly drive gene expression and appear to entrain largely nonoverlapping gene sets. The researchers found that mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolish both light- and temperature-entrained gene expression, implying that environmental cues act cell nonautonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. Together, these findings demonstrate circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and suggest that further analyses in this organism will provide new information about the evolution and function of this biological clock.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAD3 gene is the homolog of human XPD, an essential gene encoding a DNA helicase of the TFIIH complex involved in both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Some mutant alleles of RAD3, such as rad3-101 and rad3-102, have partial defects in DNA repair and a strong hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies showed that the hyper-Rec phenotype associated with rad3-101 and rad3-102 can be explained as a consequence of persistent single-stranded DNA gaps that are converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. In this study, we further characterized these events using a system in which the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination are recovered. Both rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. Mapping of these events shows that three-quarters of these crossovers reflect DSBs formed at the same positions in both sister chromatids (double sister-chromatid breaks, DSCBs). The remainder reflects DSBs formed in single chromatids (single chromatid breaks, SCBs). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. We mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications. We found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX. In addition, there was a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV. A comparison of these data with our previous analysis of spontaneous mitotic recombination events suggests that a sub-set of spontaneous events in wild-type cells may be initiated by incomplete NER reactions, and that DSCBs, which cannot be repaired by sister-chromatid recombination, are a major source of mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes.
In this study, we report the characterization of the human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori strain SMI109 as a model for bacterial adaptation to chronic infection. We used a combination of next-generation sequencing and transcriptomics to analyze the adaptations of the SMI109 strain to chronic infection, and identified a number of mutations and regulatory changes that may be important for its survival in the stomach. We also developed a new method for analyzing bacterial transcriptomics using a real-time qPCR system, which allows for the rapid and accurate analysis of large numbers of bacterial RNA samples. This system has the potential to be used in a wide range of applications, from studying bacterial adaptation to host environments to analyzing the effects of antibiotics on bacterial populations.
High-risk HPVs cause cervical and other genital cancers. These viruses can only replicate when they are in an undifferentiated state, meaning that they cannot replicate when they are in a differentiated state. HPVs evade immune surveillance by downregulating the expression of STAT-1. STAT-5 is another member of the JAK-STAT pathway that modulates the inflammatory response and plays an important role in controlling cell cycle progression in response to cytokines and growth factors. HPV E7 activates STAT-5 phosphorylation without altering total protein levels. Inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation by the drug pimozide abolishes viral genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating keratinocytes. Knockdown studies show that the STAT-5β isoform is mainly responsible for this activity and that this is mediated through the ATM DNA damage response. A downstream target of STAT-5, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), contributes to the effects on members of the ATM pathway. Overall, these findings identify an important new regulatory mechanism by which the innate immune regulator, STAT-5, promotes HPV viral replication through activation of the ATM DNA damage response.
In this article, the authors describe a study that used an immunoscreening technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) to identify potential biomarkers unique to S . Typhi chronic carriers. Chronic carriers are individuals who have been infected with S . Typhi and continue to carry the bacteria in their bile without developing any symptoms. The authors used a genomic library of S . Typhi strain CT18 to screen for immunoreactive clones in the bile of 20 patients who had undergone cholecystectomy. They found that 11 out of the 20 patients had positive bile cultures for S . Typhi and were categorized as carriers. The authors then used pooled sera of 5 patients with bile cultures positive for S . Typhi to screen for immunoreactive clones in the library. They found 12 immunoreactive clones and confirmed that 9 out of these 12 clones were unique to S . Typhi carriers. The authors also used pooled sera of healthy individuals living in a typhoid endemic area to screen for immunoreactive clones in the library. They found 3 immunoreactive clones and confirmed that 2 out of these 3 clones were unique to S . Typhi carriers. Finally, the authors used pooled sera of acute S . Typhi patients to screen for immunoreactive clones in the library. They found 4 immunoreactive clones and confirmed that 3 out of these 4 clones were unique to S . Typhi carriers. The authors identified one of the immunoreactive clones, YncE ( STY1479 ), as a potential biomarker unique to S . Typhi chronic carriers. They purified and characterized the YncE protein and found that it was highly immunoreactive in the bile of S . Typhi carriers. The authors conclude that their study has identified a potential biomarker unique to S . Typhi chronic carriers that could be used to develop improved diagnostic assays for S . Typhi carriage.
In this study, the authors used a genetic model system to study the role played by cellular RNA pools produced by homologous genomic loci in defining the transcriptional state of a silenced gene. They found that non-functional alleles of the white gene in the presence of a functional copy of white , silenced by heterochromatin , can reactivate in trans the expression of a wild type copy of the same gene. This new epigenetic phenomenon of transcriptional trans-reactivation is heritable , relies on the presence of homologous RNA’s and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing . The authors suggest that this new epigenetic phenomenon is a general level of gene expression control mediated by homologous RNA molecules in the context of heterochromatic genes .
Boophilin is a novel blood coagulation inhibitor derived from the salivary glands of the kissing bug R. prolixus. It targets a combination of prothrombinase complex, thrombin, and FXIa, leading to potent anticoagulation in vitro and in vivo. Boophilin was shown to antagonize thrombosis in mice, resulting in increased bleeding times, reduced platelet aggregation, and reduced thrombus formation in the carotid artery. It also potently inhibited fibrin clot formation in vitro and in vivo. Boophilin inhibits thrombin and FXIa complex formation by interfering with the active site of thrombin, while also inhibiting FXIa by increasing the Kd of the FXIa-FXa complex. In vivo studies showed that Boophilin inhibits thrombin and FXIa by slowing down their association and disassociation rates. Boophilin has promising potential as a novel blood coagulation inhibitor for the prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders.
The article describes a new model, called SEGMEnT, that can simulate how inflammation affects the architecture of the intestinal mucosa. Inflammation can alter the normal balance between different functions of the gut, such as absorbing nutrients and protecting against infection. The model includes agents like gut epithelial cells and inflammatory cells, and it takes into account different signaling pathways and processes like migration and differentiation. By modifying the parameters of the model, researchers can explore how different factors contribute to intestinal disease. The article states that SEGMEnT could be used as a platform for studying the role of inflammation in various gastrointestinal diseases, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and cancer.
Wolbachia pipientis is a bacterium that can be transinfected into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which are the primary vector of many arboviruses, including dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Wolbachia can block the transmission of these viruses by reducing the number of viable viruses in the mosquito, and it can also reduce the mosquito's fitness, making it less likely to transmit the virus. To test the effect of Wolbachia on mosquito fitness, researchers used backcrossing to produce a strain of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti with a Brazilian genetic background. They then released this strain into a community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. However, the Wolbachia did not invade the local mosquito population, likely due to the high frequency of pyrethroid resistance alleles in the local population. To produce a fitter Wolbachia-infected strain, researchers backcrossed the original Wolbachia-infected strain with a strain that was highly resistant to pyrethroids. They then released this strain into the same community and found that it was able to invade the local mosquito population. The researchers also used double-digest RAD-sequencing to assess the genetic similarity between the released Wolbachia-infected strain and the local mosquito population, and found that they were very similar. These results suggest that matching the genetic background of the Wolbachia to the local mosquito population is important for successful invasion of the Wolbachia.
The provided content includes a method for isolating and sequencing a population of adapted viral strains from a pool of mutants that have lost the ability to replicate in the presence of a small molecule inhibitor. The mutant virus was passaged in the presence of the inhibitor to generate a population of mutants with varying degrees of resistance to the inhibitor. The population of mutants was then sequenced to identify the genetic changes that contributed to the increased resistance. The genetic changes identified in the adapted viruses were compared to those identified in a set of individual mutants that had lost replication ability.
The partitioning, folding and aggregation properties of soluble peptides and small proteins at hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces play a crucial role in biomedically important processes. In this work, we use molecular simulations to study the folding and aggregation behavior of two synthetic peptides with secondary amphiphilic tendencies, LKKLLKLLKKLLKL (LK) and EAALAEALAEALAE (EALA), in different environments. We find that the peptides’ aggregation behavior is strongly affected by presence or absence of an interface, as well as their surface charge and hydrophobicity. Our results demonstrate that the amphiphilicity of peptides and proteins plays a crucial role for their folding, aggregation and partitioning at HHIs, and that the presence of an interface strongly influences their conformational behavior and aggregation.
HHV-6A and HHV-6B are two types of viruses that infect humans when we are young children. These viruses establish a special type of infection called latency in the cells of our body, where the virus remains hidden and does not cause any disease. However, the exact way that these viruses integrate into our body cells is not known. Scientists have studied the structure of these viruses and found that they have special sequences called telomeric repeats that are similar to the sequences at the ends of our chromosomes. They thought that these repeats might help the virus to integrate into our body cells. So, scientists created special versions of the HHV-6A virus that did not have these repeats and saw how this affected the virus's ability to replicate and integrate into our body cells. They found that the virus was able to replicate without the repeats, but it could not integrate well into our body cells. This showed that the repeats are important for the virus to integrate into our body cells.
The D13 protein is a major component of vaccinia virus, a poxvirus that causes cowpox. It has a unique and highly conserved N-terminal domain that interacts with lipid in a pincer-like conformation. The structure of D13 was determined using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. The X-ray structure of the protein was determined in complex with lipid, showing a pincer-like conformation that contains the N-terminal domain and a head domain. The head domain is a trefoil knot with a β-sheet structure. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the protein shows a trimeric assembly that is stabilized by interactions with the lipid. The structure provides insights into the mechanism of lipid binding and the formation of the vaccinia virus envelope.
This study describes the characterization of a Brachypodium distachyon mutant in the TAR2-LIKE gene that displays dramatic root phenotypes, which appear to result from an upwardly disturbed auxin homeostasis. This mutant is the first example of a root phenotype in Brachypodium caused by altered auxin signaling. The study also highlights the importance of auxin in root development and the potential of auxin as a target for crop improvement.
In this study, the authors artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins in yeast and found that promoter organization influenced the genetic changes leading to increased expression. They divided genes based on their promoter class and found that promoter class did not affect the amount of change in expression but did affect the mechanism by which the change was achieved. DPN genes (genes with a pronounced proximal NFR) increased expression mainly by large-scale duplication, while OPN genes (genes lacking a NFR proximal to the TSS) increased expression mainly by trans mutations not involving duplications. The authors suggest that promoter organization may influence the evolution of gene expression.
This is a scientific paper about the role of a protein called Tax, which is produced by a virus called Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Tax activates the protein NF-κB, which is involved in many cellular processes, including cell division and proliferation. However, Tax also causes the expression of two proteins called p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1, which cause p53-/pRb-independent cellular senescence. This is a process where cells stop dividing and enter a state of rest. The authors of this paper show that the cellular senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations in Tax that reduce NF-κB activation and prevented by blocking NF-κB using a degradation-resistant mutant of I-κBα despite constitutive IKK activation. They also show that down-regulation of NF-κB by the HTLV-1 anti-sense protein, HBZ, delay or prevent the onset of Tax-induced senescence. The authors suggest that the balance between Tax and HBZ expression determines the outcome of HTLV-1 infection. They propose that the activation of IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation and triggering of senescence constitutes a checkpoint against HTLV-1 infection.
The article presents a new model of the human frontal lobe function that helps people make decisions in uncertain and open-ended situations. The model explains how the frontal lobe manages a collection of different strategies for making decisions and chooses the best one to use. It also shows how the model is able to make predictions about people's decisions based on their preferences and past experiences. The article also describes an experiment that tests the model and shows that it is able to accurately predict people's decisions. It concludes that the model provides a new understanding of how the frontal lobe helps people make decisions in uncertain and open-ended situations.
The present paper proposes a computational approach to analyze the long-term effects of a pharmacological treatment on a biological system. The approach, called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT), is based on the assumption that the effect of a treatment intervention can be predicted by inferring necessary changes in a set of model parameters that describe the transition between experimental data obtained during different stages of the treatment. The ADAPT approach was applied to a model of mouse hepatic lipid and plasma lipoprotein metabolism to identify which metabolic parameters and consequently metabolic fluxes necessarily had to change to describe the dynamic trend in the experimental data obtained upon pharmacological treatment of mice by liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317. The present study predicted that the scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1), a receptor that facilitates the uptake of cholesterol from high-density-lipoproteins (HDL) by the liver, decreased rather than increased upon T0901317 treatment. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by immunoblot analysis of SR-B1 protein expression in hepatic membranes. The computational analysis provided an integrative understanding of the dynamic response induced by T0901317 treatment that was not directly apparent from the experimental data itself. The ADAPT approach has the potential to be applied to a wide range of systems biology models to study the effects of pharmacological interventions on biological systems.
The spinocerebellar system is responsible for coordinating complex movements, which require precise control of multiple limb segments. In the cerebellum, this is achieved through the integration of sensory information from the periphery and motor commands from the cerebral cortex. The integration of sensory information from multiple afferent fibers into a single output signal is mediated by granule cells (GrCs), which are contacted by parallel fibers (PFs) that receive input from numerous sensory afferents. In this context, we explore how the spinocerebellar system might implement a mathematical function that integrates information from multiple dimensions, which is necessary for coordinating complex movements. Specifically, we consider how the system might integrate information from multiple joints to coordinate movements of multiple limb segments. We examine how the system can utilize the linear recombination properties of GrCs to implement a function that approximates non-linear relationships between multiple joint angles and velocities, which is necessary for coordinating movements of multiple limb segments. We also consider how the system can utilize the non-linear properties of GrCs to implement a function that approximates non-linear relationships between multiple joint angles, velocities, and accelerations, which is necessary for coordinating movements of multiple limb segments. Our findings suggest that the spinocerebellar system might implement a function that approximates non-linear relationships between multiple joint angles, velocities, and accelerations using a combination of linear and non-linear recombination of sensory information.
A study was conducted to determine how microRNAs are impacted when Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are infected with Chikungunya virus. The researchers sequenced small RNA libraries from two mosquito cell lines: one uninfected and one infected with CHIKV. They identified 88 known and 79 novel microRNAs in the uninfected cell line and 79 known and 9 novel microRNAs in the infected cell line. Comparing the two cell lines, they found that 77 microRNAs were differentially expressed. The researchers then used computational methods to identify potential targets for these microRNAs, and classified the targets into their respective pathways. Their findings provide insight into how microRNAs are regulated during CHIKV infection in Ae. albopictus and may lead to the development of antiviral strategies.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a parasitic infection that affects humans and livestock, and causes significant medical and economic problems in many developing countries. In Iran, CE has a considerable economic impact, with an estimated annual cost of US$232.3 million including both direct and indirect costs. This study has also estimated the cost per surgical human case at US$1,539 and the cost associated with human CE at US$93.39 million. The cost associated with livestock CE was estimated at US$132 million. These estimates can be used to inform decision-makers about the costs of CE and to prioritize limited resources for preventive measures.
Mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) is a small circular DNA virus that infects mouse cells and causes tumors in rodents. The virus has two phases of infection, early and late, and both phases are important for its ability to transform cells. During the late phase of infection, the virus produces large amounts of viral RNA, which is then processed into viral proteins. In this study, the authors used deep sequencing to analyze MPyV infection in mouse cells. They found that early and late viral transcripts were produced during both early and late phases of infection, but that there were major changes in the processing and editing of viral transcripts during the late phase of infection. They also found that many host genes were significantly upregulated or downregulated during MPyV infection, and that these changes were associated with specific biological processes, such as metabolism, DNA replication, and protein turnover. The authors also found that MPyV infection caused significant changes in the expression of several long noncoding RNAs. Together, these results provide a detailed picture of MPyV infection and its effects on host cell metabolism and gene expression.
The mathematical model presented in this paper is used to explain the variation in human endurance running performance observed over several decades. The model uses a data-driven approach to predict the relationship between running speed, maximal aerobic intensity, and carbohydrate metabolism. The model is based on a simplified metabolic model that assumes constant rates of fat and carbohydrate oxidation as a function of running speed. The model also accounts for the effects of muscle glycogen depletion and liver glycogen storage on running performance. The model is applied to the data of Karlsson and colleagues, who measured the performance of 169 marathon runners over a 30-year period. The results of the model suggest that the variation in marathon performance can be explained by variations in running speed and maximal aerobic intensity. The model also predicts the effect of carbohydrate loading on running performance, and suggests that a strategy of carbohydrate loading can be effective for improving performance at speeds above approximately 70% of maximal aerobic intensity. The model is also used to estimate the maximal distance that a runner can run before glycogen depletion becomes significant, and suggests that this distance is approximately 20 kilometers for a runner of average speed and maximal aerobic intensity. The model is applied to the data of Maggioni and colleagues, who measured the performance of 54 marathon runners over a 10-year period, and suggests that the variation in marathon performance over the course of a decade can be explained by changes in running speed and maximal aerobic intensity. The model also suggests that the variation in marathon performance can be explained by the effects of carbohydrate loading on running performance, and the effects of muscle glycogen depletion and liver glycogen storage on running performance. The model is also used to estimate the maximal distance that a runner can run before glycogen depletion becomes significant, and suggests that this distance is approximately 22 kilometers for a runner of average speed and maximal aerobic intensity. The model is applied to the data of Karlsson and colleagues, who measured the performance of 169 marathon runners over a 30-year period, and suggests that the variation in marathon performance can be explained by variations in running speed and maximal aerobic intensity.

Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite that infects most warm-blooded animals, including humans. It has been extensively studied due to its prevalence and potential effects on human health, including congenital malformations and severe ocular disease. However, the diversity of Toxoplasma strains has historically been underappreciated. Recent studies have identified several distinct clades of Toxoplasma strains, including the classical type I strains, as well as atypical strains that are more prevalent in South America and have been associated with severe disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the genomic and transcriptomic differences between Toxoplasma strains from different clades to gain a better understanding of the genetic determinants of virulence in Toxoplasma. The authors used RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes of Toxoplasma-infected mouse macrophages in order to identify host and parasite genes that are differentially regulated in a strain-specific manner. They found that several strains were able to induce the host interferon response, which is thought to be detrimental to the parasite. They also identified parasite genes that were differentially expressed between virulent and avirulent strains, and found that some of these genes were located within large chromosomal rearrangements. Overall, this study provides important insights into the genetic basis of virulence in Toxoplasma, and highlights the importance of considering strain diversity when studying this parasite.
The study "Isolation and characterization of recombinant polioviruses from heterologous transfection of template RNAs" provides a comprehensive description of the isolation and characterization of recombinant polioviruses from heterologous transfection of template RNAs. The study uses a novel reverse genetic system to isolate recombinant viruses from transfected cells. The study shows that the recombination process is replicative and occurs through a process of resolution. The study provides important insights into the molecular mechanism of recombination in positive-strand RNA viruses and suggests a means by which "evolution by duplication" may occur. The study's findings have important implications for our wider understanding of the evolution of positive-strand RNA viruses.
The study investigates the relationship between adipocyte brown fat and the beigeing process. The authors propose that the brown fat receptor Oct3 may be involved in the browning process, and the study provides evidence to support this theory. The authors identify a new noncanonical function of Oct3 in white adipocyte browning and thermogenesis. They find that Oct3 is not expressed in brown fat, but is expressed in white fat. They also show that Oct3 is involved in the regulation of the beigeing process. The authors find that Oct3 is a novel receptor that modulates the browning process, and that it may be a potential therapeutic target for treating obesity and cold intolerance.
HP1 proteins are important regulators of heterochromatin-mediated silencing and chromosome structure in mammalian cells. HP1 proteins are known to bind histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9, but they also interact with histone H3 in a region located partially inside the nucleosomal barrel at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome. This interaction is important for efficient SWI/SNF remodeling and HP1 proteins seem to use this property to detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling. HP1 proteins also seem to be present both during phases of silencing and transcriptional activity in euchromatin.
We analyzed the self-containment of RNA sequences using a simple scoring method based on the folding of a sequence in different contexts. We found that pre-miRNA hairpin sequences are highly self-contained, while most other RNAs have much lower self-containment. Self-containment was also shown to be correlated with other features of RNA sequences, such as conservation and thermodynamic stability. We proposed that high self-containment is an intrinsic property of certain RNA sequences and may be evolutionarily selected to maintain RNA structure and function.
The paper presents a study of the role of four transcription factors in Arabidopsis defense against fungal necrotrophs. The authors used mutants of these transcription factors and found that they were more susceptible to infection by Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. They then used microarray analysis to identify genes that were up-regulated in these mutants and found that many of these genes encoded secreted peptides. They named these peptides PROVIR factors and found that they were also involved in disease resistance. The authors then used fluorescence microscopy to localize these peptides in the plant cell. They found that many of the peptides localized in the pericellular space. Finally, they used quantitative PCR to confirm the up-regulation of these genes and to study the effect of the fungal infection on their expression. Overall, the paper presents a comprehensive study of the role of these transcription factors in disease resistance and identifies potential targets for future research on disease resistance in plants.
Infertility is a common problem affecting millions of couples worldwide. Many cases of infertility are caused by embryo implantation failure, a process in which an embryo fails to adhere to and invade the uterine endometrium. Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) is a transcription factor that is important for many cellular processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, and metabolism. Several studies have shown that FOXO1 is important for embryo implantation in mice. In this study, the authors used uterine ablation and genetic knockout mice to show that FOXO1 is important for normal embryo implantation in mice. The authors also used RNA sequencing to identify the pathways that are affected by FOXO1 knockdown in the uterus during early pregnancy. Their findings provide new insights into the role of FOXO1 in embryo implantation and suggest that FOXO1 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of infertility.
Dengue is a neglected tropical disease that is transmitted by female mosquitoes, predominantly Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. It causes severe forms of illness that are potentially fatal and is prevalent in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that about 52% of the people at risk of dengue live in 10 countries of the WHO South-East Asia Region. Bangladesh, located in South Asia and surrounded by India and Myanmar, is one such country where dengue is endemic. Dengue cases have been reported in Bangladesh since 2000, most commonly among adults and older children living in metropolitan cities. However, despite no effective control program being introduced and no changes in surveillance until 2010 when serological confirmation was mandated for case reporting, nationally reported cases have declined since 2002. This decline might be partially attributable to increased prevalence of immunity and reduction in mosquito breeding sites resulting from public awareness. However, there is considerable under-reporting inherent in the passive hospital-based surveillance system. To identify the spatial variation in monthly dengue cases and its association with climatic and demographic factors, we developed a negative binomial generalised linear mixed effect model accounting for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal random effects. The model was fitted to the district-level (64 districts) monthly reported dengue cases aggregated over the period 2000 to 2009. We found that mean monthly temperature and its interaction with mean monthly diurnal temperature range, lagged by two months were significantly associated with dengue incidence. Mean monthly rainfall at two months lag was positively associated with dengue incidence. Densely populated districts and districts bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others. The model estimated that 92% of the annual dengue cases occurred between August and September. Cases were identified across the country with 94% in the capital Dhaka, which is located almost in the middle of the country. Less than half of the affected districts reported cases as observed from the surveillance data. The proportion reported varied by month with a higher proportion reported in high-incidence districts, but dropped towards the end of high transmission season. The model developed in this study can facilitate the efficient distribution of vector control interventions to areas of highest need at the appropriate time. It is useful for identifying locations where DENV transmission occurs but incidence data are lacking.
Researchers have found that when mammals are placed in a new environment, they form a "home base" that they visit the most and stay at for the longest time. In mice, researchers found a new type of place that they call "knots." Knots are not home bases, but they are marked by twisting and turning paths. They are typically only one knot per session and have clear boundaries. Knot-scribbling behavior is linked to the environment of the mice. It seems to be a way for them to gain a better understanding of their surroundings and to orient themselves within the environment. The behavior is linked to the vestibular system, which is responsible for detecting movement and position in space. Knot-scribbling could be a useful tool for researchers studying how animals explore and navigate their environment.
In this study, the authors found a new compound called NGx04 that is effective against fungal infections. They discovered that NGx04 targets a protein called Sec14p, which is essential for the growth and virulence of fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans. The authors also showed that NGx04 has a fungicidal effect against a fluconazole-resistant strain of C. neoformans. Overall, this study provides evidence that NGx04 is a promising new antifungal agent.
The treatment of a parasitic disease that affects over 200 million people called schistosomiasis depends on one drug called praziquantel. Researchers have found that mefloquine, a drug used to treat malaria, can also kill the worms that cause schistosomiasis. In experiments with mice, a single dose of mefloquine killed over 70% of the worms in the body. The drug was also effective against young developing stages of the worms. The results of these experiments suggest that mefloquine could be a promising new treatment for schistosomiasis.
The study was conducted to map podoconiosis in Cameroon, a neglected tropical disease characterized by swelling of the lower limbs. The study used a multi-stage sampling design with stratification of the country by environmental risk of podoconiosis. Seven-six villages from 40 health districts were surveyed, and all individuals of 15 years and above in the village were screened for lymphedema. A clinical algorithm was used to reliably diagnose podoconiosis, excluding filarial-associated lymphedema. Individuals with lymphedema were tested for circulating Wuchereria bancrofti antigen and specific IgG4 using the Alere Filariasis Test Strips ( FTS ) test and the Standard Diagnostics ( SD ) BIOLINE lymphatic filariasis IgG4 test ( Wb123 ) respectively, in addition to thick blood films. Presence of DNA specific to W. bancrofti was checked on night blood using a qPCR technique. Overall, 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated in the study. Of the 83 individuals with lymphedema, two were found to be FTS positive and all were negative using the Wb123 test. No microfilaria of W. bancrofti were found in the night blood of any individual with clinical lymphedema. None were found to be positive for W. bancrofti using qPCR. Of the two FTS positive cases, one was positive for Mansonella perstans DNA, while the other harbored Loa loa microfilaria. Overall, 52 people with podoconiosis were identified after applying the clinical algorithm. The overall prevalence of podoconiosis was found to be 0.5% (95% [confidence interval] CI; 0.4–0.7) . At least one case of podoconiosis was found in every region of Cameroon except the two surveyed villages in Adamawa. Of the 40 health districts surveyed, 17 districts had no cases of podoconiosis; in 15 districts, mean prevalence was between 0.2% and 1.0%; and in the remaining eight, mean prevalence was between 1.2% and 2.7%. The findings will be used to develop a podoconiosis control program in Cameroon.
The article describes the role of the Notch signaling pathway in the retention of germline stem cells (GSCs) in the Drosophila ovary. It shows that GSCs express the Notch ligand delta, and that its absence leads to a reduction in GSC number. The article also demonstrates that the loss of GSCs is due to increased cell division and apoptosis of GSCs in the absence of Notch signaling. The authors show that Notch signaling regulates the expression of E-cadherin in the GSCs and that E-cadherin expression is required for proper GSC retention. The article also discusses the role of insulin signaling in GSC retention and shows that it is independent of Notch signaling. The authors conclude that Notch signaling regulates GSC retention through the control of cell division and apoptosis, and that it is an important component of the GSC niche.
We recently showed that the protein kinase encoded by the HCMV ( HHV-5 ) UL97 gene is a functional Cdk, although UL97 does not share significant amino acid sequence identity with any known cellular Cdk . To further analyze the function of UL97, we tested other conserved herpesviral kinases ( CHPKs ) encoded by HHV-1, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, and -8. We found that all of these CHPKs were able to induce Rb phosphorylation in vivo, but only HHV-1, -2, and -5 were able to efficiently disrupt the nuclear lamina and induce lamin A phosphorylation. Interestingly, the HHV-8 CHPK was not able to phosphorylate Rb or lamin A, and was unable to disrupt the nuclear lamina. We also found that while all of the beta- and gamma-herpesviral CHPKs displayed Cdk activity when expressed in yeast, none of the alpha-herpesviral CHPKs were able to functionally substitute for cellular Cdks. These results show that while the UL97 protein kinase encoded by HCMV has many functions in common with other herpesviral CHPKs, the individual CHPKs have a wide range of unique and distinct functions that likely play important roles in herpesviral infection and replication.
Melioidosis is a disease that is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. It is commonly found in tropical countries. Scientists need to know where this bacterium is found in order to prevent people from getting sick. To do this, they have to use a certain way to collect soil samples. The way that the scientists collect the soil samples is not the same everywhere and needs to be improved to make sure that they don't miss any areas where the disease might be found. The scientists want to make sure that the way they collect soil samples is the same all over the world so that they can make a better map of where the disease is found and can help people in the right places. The scientists have formed a working group to work on this problem and want to share the information they come up with with other scientists.
We developed a stem peptide from the envelope protein of dengue virus (DV) that specifically binds to a trimeric intermediate form of the protein during infection. The stem peptide binds to the membrane bound intermediate protein and prevents it from dissociating into monomers. This intermediate form of the protein is thought to be involved in the fusion process of the virus. The stem peptide binds to the trimeric intermediate protein in a pH dependent manner. The binding is not affected by the presence of divalent cations. The stem peptide also binds to the trimeric intermediate protein in a competitive manner with the membrane. The stem peptide inhibits the infection of dengue virus by binding to the virion at neutral pH before attachment to the cell. It also prevents the fusion of the virion with the endosome membrane by binding to the trimeric intermediate form of the envelope protein.
The authors present a new method for the preservation and sequencing of Vibrio cholerae from stool specimens collected in remote areas with limited laboratory resources. The authors demonstrate that dried stool samples can be stored for up to two years at room temperature and subsequently used for genomic analysis. This new method has the potential to significantly improve the ability to study and respond to cholera outbreaks in resource-limited settings.
This article describes the role of the cytoplasmic motor protein, Dynein, in regulating epithelial polarity. The authors found that Dynein is required for the apical targeting of the protein Stardust (Sdt), which is a component of the Crumb complex that regulates apical identity in epithelial cells. The authors also discovered that a specific sdt mRNA isoform is responsible for the apical localization of Sdt protein. They found that this isoform contains an alternatively spliced exon that is required for apical localization. The authors suggest that the apical localization of sdt mRNA may be regulated by microtubule motors, as overexpression of a mutant form of Dynein leads to mislocalization of sdt mRNA. The authors propose that microtubule motors may be involved in the localization of other proteins required for epithelial polarity.
In this study, the authors demonstrate genetic exchange between two strains of Leishmania infantum in the sand fly vector. They use two different drug-selectable markers linked to fluorescent reporters, mCherry and Citrine, to identify yellow fluorescent hybrids as a biomarker of mating between two individuals from the same strain. The authors show that genetic exchange has no inter-specific barriers and that recombination events occur within the same genotype during the mating process. They also demonstrate that Leishmania is able to perform recombination between the same genotype during the mating process. Their findings have important implications for our understanding of the reproductive mode of Leishmania and for the development of novel strategies for the control of leishmaniasis.
This study uses PCR and high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis to investigate the genetic diversity of Leishmania donovani strains in Ethiopia. The study analyzes 63 L. donovani strains isolated from visceral leishmaniasis patients in Ethiopia. These strains are grouped into two major populations, based on the size of the PCR amplicon. The first group is mainly found in northwestern Ethiopia and is characterized by a 290 bp amplicon, while the second group is found in southwestern Ethiopia and is characterized by a 450 bp amplicon. The study also compares the genetic diversity of L. donovani in Ethiopia with strains from Sudan, Kenya, and India. This study is important because it provides new information about the genetic diversity of L. donovani in Ethiopia and may help in the development of new diagnostic and treatment strategies for visceral leishmaniasis.
HIV-1 is a virus that undergoes a lot of genetic variation due to many factors. These variations are important for the evolution of the virus. A specific type of genetic variation is recombination, which occurs when two different HIV-1 genomes (from different subtypes) combine to form a new, hybrid virus. This recombination can occur in the envelope gene and other parts of the genome, but it is more likely to occur in regions where there is high sequence identity. The authors hypothesized that only a subset of recombination breakpoints have a significant impact on the evolution of HIV-1. To test this hypothesis, they created a computer model to predict where recombination breakpoints are likely to occur. They then compared their predictions to the actual observed breakpoints from the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The authors found that the majority of recombination breakpoints occur within the envelope gene, which is important for immune evasion. They also found that some regions of the genome have a higher tendency to be recombined. Their findings suggest that only a small subset of recombination breakpoints have a significant impact on the evolution of HIV-1, and that the majority are neutral with limited biological significance.
Computational modeling is a growing field of neuroscience that uses mathematical and statistical methods to analyze brain data and infer the underlying neural mechanisms. Hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) is an advanced statistical technique that enables researchers to jointly model two different types of data, parametric and non-parametric, in a single Bayesian analysis. HBI involves a three-step process: prior specification, posterior inference, and parameter estimation. Prior specification involves choosing the prior distributions for the model parameters. Posterior inference involves using Bayes' theorem to update these prior distributions given the data. Finally, parameter estimation involves computing the posterior mean and standard deviation for each model parameter. HBI has several advantages over traditional statistical methods, such as hierarchical linear modeling. It can jointly model multiple types of data and handle unbalanced data. It also provides a natural way to incorporate prior knowledge into the analysis. Additionally, HBI has been shown to be more robust to outliers and parameter misspecification than traditional methods.
This study used genetic and molecular methods to investigate the role of the Hox genes in the development of the auditory system of the mouse. The authors show that Hox genes are important for the patterning of auditory neurons and for the assembly of auditory circuitry. They used a new genetic tool to selectively label neurons in the hindbrain region that give rise to the auditory system, and then used immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization to investigate the expression of Hox genes in these neurons. They also used genetic mutants to study the function of Hox genes in auditory development. Their results show that Hox genes are required for the proper development of auditory circuitry, and that they have different effects on different parts of the auditory system. Overall, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control the development of the auditory system.
The bacterium Saccharophagus degradans 2-40 is the first free-living marine bacterium to be sequenced and assembled. The bacterium was isolated from decaying salt marsh grass in Chesapeake Bay watershed in 2002, and is capable of degrading a wide range of complex carbohydrates, including cellulose, chitin, laminarin, and xylan, using 44 different enzymes. This unique ability makes it an important player in the marine carbon cycle, and its genome provides valuable insights into the metabolic pathways and enzymes involved in carbohydrate degradation in marine environments.
Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a type of virus that causes brain infection in humans and is a major public health problem in Asia. Different strains of JEV have emerged over the years, with one strain called genotype III (GI) being the most dominant one until recently. However, the exact mechanism behind the replacement of GI by genotype I (GI) is still not known. The researchers in this study used Chinese mosquitoes called Cx. pipiens to investigate the role of mosquitoes in the replacement of GI by GIII. They exposed female mosquitoes to either GI or GIII JEV strains and collected infected mosquitoes at 7 and 14 days after infection. They then determined the infection rate, replication kinetics, dissemination rate, and transmission potential of the infected JEV strains in mosquitoes. The study found that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates, growth kinetics, dissemination rates, and transmission rates. These results suggest that mosquitoes may not play a critical role in the replacement of GIII by GI.
Dengue is a viral disease that is spread by mosquitoes and affects people living in tropical and subtropical regions. Malaysia has had large outbreaks of dengue fever in recent years. This study aimed to study the demographics and clinical characteristics of dengue deaths in Malaysia from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014. The study involved reviewing the medical records of 322 dengue deaths in Malaysia. The study found that the most common co-morbidities among adults and elderly patients were diabetes and hypertension. The most common warning signs reported were lethargy and vomiting, but 22.4% did not have any warning signs. It was found that more adults developed severe plasma leakage and more than half suffered from multi-organ involvement. Dengue shock syndrome was the leading cause of death, regardless of age groups, with a death rate of 74.2% in children, 69.5% in adults, and 71.4% in the elderly. The study highlights the need for early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent dengue deaths.
Understanding the mechanisms that drive female attractiveness is important for understanding the evolution of sexual selection and mating systems in insects. In Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, insulin signaling affects the composition and attractiveness of the female pheromone profile, but the tissue-specific effects of insulin signaling on attractiveness and how it interacts with other factors to determine female attractiveness are not well understood. Here, we use a combination of genetic manipulation and behavioral assays to investigate the tissue-specific effects of insulin signaling on female attractiveness in Drosophila melanogaster. We found that insulin signaling in the ovary and fat body affect female attractiveness in opposite ways, suggesting that these two tissues may be involved in different aspects of female attractiveness. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms that drive female attractiveness and the factors that determine the outcome of sexual selection in Drosophila melanogaster.
Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) is a highly contagious virus that has caused outbreaks in West Africa. In this study, the authors developed a statistical modeling approach to estimate the basic reproductive number ( R0 ) for each affected district and each country using weekly incident case numbers. They found that R0 ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, from 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and from 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone. The authors found that socio-demographic variables such as urbanisation, including high population density and high wealth index, were positively associated with R0. Their findings provide insights into the spread of EVD and its risk factors, which could improve epidemic management in the future.
What factors affect the evolutionary rate of proteins? In the current study, the authors compared structural properties and evolutionary age to determine how both intrinsic and historical factors affect the rate of evolution of proteins. They used a large set of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins, with mapped PDB structures. They found that previously observed structural correlations also hold within each age group, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and evolutionary rates. However, age modulates the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate. Additionally, younger proteins tend to evolve faster than older proteins, despite being less designable. The authors show that previously reported relationships between age and rate cannot be explained by structural biases among age groups. Finally, they introduce a knowledge-based potential function to study the stability of proteins through large-scale computation. They find that older proteins are more stable for their native structure, and more robust to mutations, than younger ones.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of the Polycomb-like 3 (Pcl3) protein in regulating Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) function in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). PRC2 is a multiprotein complex that regulates gene expression by adding methyl groups to histone proteins. The authors show that Pcl3 interacts with the core components of PRC2 and promotes its function. They also show that Pcl3 is essential for ESC self-renewal and plays a role in regulating H3K27me3 levels and Suz12 binding to the genome. The authors conclude that Pcl3 is an important regulator of PRC2 at a subset of target genes and plays a critical role in ESC biology.
Feeding state affects the expression of chemosensory genes in C. elegans.
Buruli ulcer is a skin infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The disease is often found in tropical and subtropical areas. In this study, researchers tested the idea that mosquitoes might be involved in the transmission of M. ulcerans in Australia by testing adult mosquitoes for the presence of the bacteria. The study found a strong dose-response relationship between the number of M. ulcerans-positive mosquitoes in a town and the average cumulative incidence of Buruli ulcer in that town. This means that as the number of mosquitoes infected with M. ulcerans in a town increases, the average number of cases of Buruli ulcer in that town also increases. The study found that mosquitoes were likely to be involved in the transmission of M. ulcerans in Australia, and that this could have implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent Buruli ulcer.
The rat demyelination (dmy) mutation is a unique genetic model for studying the maintenance of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). The gene responsible for this mutation has been identified as the Mrs2 gene, which encodes an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria. The dmy/dmy rats show severe myelin breakdown, with major mitochondrial deficits and increased numbers of mitochondria in the swollen cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. MRS2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats show that MRS2 is dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes. The study provides evidence that the maintenance of myelin has a different mechanism from its initial production, and that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin.
Microarray-based gene expression signatures have the potential to help diagnose diseases and predict patient outcomes. However, there are issues with the current documentation standards that make it difficult to apply signatures to study-external patients. In order to improve the use of signatures in clinical practice, researchers from the University of Tübingen in Germany analyzed the classification rules from eight publicly available clinical microarray studies. They found that discrepancies between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as frequent as 30% (worst case) and 18% (median). By using the proposed documentation by value strategy, the median discrepancy was reduced to 1%. This approach involves documenting the quantitative specification of a classification rule, the preprocessing method, and the normalization dependent scale that is underlying the signature. The researchers demonstrated that this strategy can substantially improve the reliability and effectiveness of evaluating microarray-based gene expression diagnostic signatures.
Curli amyloid fibrils are produced by the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium and are essential for its biofilm formation and resistance to antimicrobial agents. These fibrils are composed of curli protein and can be modulated by peptides that target specific regions of the curli protein. In this study, the authors used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of curli fibrils and identify potential regions for peptide-based inhibition. They found that two peptides, ANK6 and D-ANK6, interact with curli fibrils in a way that may disrupt their structure, and that these peptides can also inhibit curli fibril formation in S. typhimurium. The authors suggest that these peptides could be used as potential inhibitors of curli fibril formation and biofilm formation in S. typhimurium, and that further research could lead to the development of novel antimicrobial agents.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne disease that affects the brain and has high death rates and long-term effects on survivors. It is endemic in most of Asia, including the Philippines. The authors conducted a review of JE in the Philippines by searching scientific databases, presentations, and surveillance data from January 2011 to March 2014. The study found that JE is widespread in the Philippines and affects mainly children under 15 years old. The authors recommend the integration of JE vaccine into the routine immunization program in the Philippines to prevent this serious disease.
The article is about the study of the evolution of genetic robustness. Genetic robustness refers to the ability of a biological system to continue functioning following genetic mutations. The authors argue that genetic robustness is a complex trait that is influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. They suggest that environmental robustness is a subset of genetic robustness and that it is influenced by factors such as the availability of nutrients and the presence of toxins. The authors also suggest that genetic robustness may have evolved as a byproduct of selection for other adaptive traits, such as the ability to grow in a wide range of environments. Overall, the article highlights the importance of studying the relationship between genetic robustness and environmental robustness in order to better understand the evolution of biological systems.
In this study, we investigated the effects of S . mansoni infection on antibody responses to measles vaccination among pre-school children. We also examined the effect of praziquantel treatment on these antibody responses. The study was conducted in Uganda among fishing communities on the shores of Lake Victoria. Children between the ages of 3 and 5 years were enrolled in the study and their stool samples were examined for the presence of S . mansoni infection using the Kato-Katz technique. We found that children with S . mansoni infection had lower levels of measles-specific antibodies than uninfected children at one week after measles immunisation. Furthermore, we observed that praziquantel treatment given to children with S . mansoni infection resulted in higher levels of measles-specific antibodies compared to those who did not receive treatment. These findings suggest that S . mansoni infection may impair vaccine responses in children and that praziquantel treatment may improve these responses. The study also highlights the importance of addressing schistosomiasis in order to improve vaccine responses and overall health outcomes in affected communities.
In this study, we introduced a new framework for the analysis of bacterial population structure based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) data. The framework is based on Bayesian statistical inference and allows for the identification of genetically distinct populations and the quantification of the amount of genetic exchange among them. The framework combines different statistical tools to identify the genetic population structure, quantify the genetic admixture within populations, and characterize the genetic shape of populations. We illustrated the use of the framework by analyzing an MLST dataset of over 4,800 strains of the bacterial species Neisseria meningitidis and N. lactamica. We showed that our framework was able to correctly identify the known populations and characterize the patterns of genetic exchange between them. The framework can be applied to other bacterial species and can also be extended to accommodate other types of sequence data.
The study used a computational model of sensory cortical areas to investigate how top-down beta rhythms modulate attention. The model included L5 pyramidal cells that resonate to top-down beta frequency inputs and activate ascending synaptic projections to L4 and L2/3, leading to biased competition in superficial layers. The model predicted that the cholinergic drive can support selective attention by modulating the activity of slow-inhibitory interneurons in a gamma rhythm-related manner.
The development of a mathematical framework to calibrate and predict stochastic epidemic models is crucial for decision making in public health. In this article, we propose a novel calibration approach, Multiple Shocks Simulation-based Reservoir Estimation (MSSRE), to estimate key epidemic parameters and predict future disease dynamics. MSSRE utilizes a non-linear approximation of the likelihood function for stochastic compartmental models, which allows for efficient calibration in real-time. The accuracy of MSSRE is evaluated by comparing its predictions against the true underlying dynamics of simulated epidemics with unknown parameters. We also compare MSSRE with three state-of-the-art benchmark methods, including an assumption of independent Poisson observations, particle filter, and ensemble Kalman filter. Our results show that MSSRE performs as well as or better than the benchmark methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Overall, our approach provides a valuable tool for public health professionals to effectively respond to epidemic threats in real-time.
This study investigated the nature of perceptual serial dependence, a phenomenon where the perception of one stimulus is influenced by the history of previous stimuli. The authors used a multilevel modeling approach and found that past perceptual decisions had a stronger influence on subsequent perceptual biases than did physical stimuli. This finding provides evidence for the Two-process hypothesis of serial dependence, which suggests that low-level adaptation and high-level decision integration contribute to this phenomenon. The study also found that decision-based biases emerged even when participants were explicitly instructed not to make decisions, suggesting that this bias may be a fundamental aspect of perceptual processing.
Circadian rhythms are internal 24-hour timekeeping systems that allow organisms to anticipate daily changes in the environment. A key component of the system in flies and mammals is a transcription factor complex that activates the transcription of genes involved in circadian function. To better understand the role of transcription in the circadian system, researchers have analyzed the effects of a fusion protein of the circadian transcription factor CYC and the viral protein 16 (VP16) in flies. The addition of VP16 to CYC imparts to the CLK–CYC complex strongly enhanced transcriptional activity relative to that of CLK–CYC alone. This increase in activity is manifested in flies expressing CYC-VP16 as well as in cultured cells. These flies also have increased levels of CLK–CYC direct target gene mRNAs as well as a short period, implicating circadian transcription in period determination. These results indicate that transcriptional activation is important for the function of the CLK–CYC complex.
Scientists have found that a gene, pmrD, is responsible for making the bacterium Salmonella resistant to polymyxin B. However, this gene only works in Salmonella if it is part of a larger cluster of genes. When the pmrD gene is taken from Salmonella and put into a different bacterium, E. coli, it doesn't work. Scientists have found that the reason for this is that the pmrD gene works with another gene, called PmrB, which is different in the two bacteria. By swapping the PmrB gene from E. coli into Salmonella, the scientists were able to make the pmrD gene work in E. coli. This finding shows that the ability of a horizontally acquired gene to confer a selective advantage upon a recipient organism is dictated by quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of ancestral proteins.
The researchers in this study are trying to figure out how to tell when a stem cell starts to turn into a specific type of cell. This is a very important process because it can help scientists discover which genes are important for this change to happen. In the past, scientists have tried to figure this out by comparing the genes expressed in two different types of cells at the end of the differentiation process. However, this method has limitations because it may also include genes that are not actually important for the differentiation process to occur. This new method involves measuring the average gene expression of a mix of cells at different stages of the differentiation process and using statistical analysis to identify which genes are important for the differentiation to occur. The researchers tested this method on embryonic stem cells turning into heart cells and found that they could identify a new gene called Smarcad1 that is important for the differentiation process. They also provided a theoretical explanation and statistical method for this approach, as well as two experiments to validate their findings.
Our study explores how to functionally cluster genes implicated in the same disease using functional association data. We found that genes implicated through de novo sequence variants tend to cluster together due to a confounding bias in coding-sequence length, which can lead to false positive findings. To address this bias, we developed a new method called phenotypic linkage analysis that groups genes with similar phenotypic annotations, thereby revealing functional associations between genes in a network of biologically related diseases. This new method was able to identify functional associations between gene variants and control for bias, showing significant power to functionally cluster variant genes underlying polygenic disorders. Overall, our study suggests that phenotypic linkage analysis is a promising tool for understanding complex disease mechanisms.
The study examined the effect of Mexico's tax on non-essential food and drinks with high sugar content. Food and drink purchases were monitored by the Mexican government through the Nielsen Consumer Panel Services from January 2012 to December 2014. The tax was implemented in January 2014, and the results showed that overall, household purchases of taxed foods decreased by 25 grams (g) per capita per month in 2014 compared to what was expected based on the pre-tax trend. When looking at the SES subgroups, low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods in 2014 compared to what was expected, while medium and high SES households showed a decrease of 5.8% and 0%, respectively. The results suggest that the tax had a positive impact on reducing the consumption of non-essential food and drinks with high sugar content in Mexico.
The Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) neuron in the locust's brain responds best to objects that are approaching on a direct collision course. The response of the LGMD is characterized by a maximum at tmax + δ, where tmax is the time of peak response and δ is the delay between stimulation and response. The response of the LGMD can be modeled using the so-called η-function. This function predicts that the time of peak response Trel, which is the time difference between the peak of the response and the time of collision, depends linearly on the halfsize-to-velocity ratio l/v. The η-function also predicts that the peak response occurs at a fixed angular size. However, experimental data have shown that the actual peak response occurs at a slightly different angular size and that the time of peak response is not always the same as the time of collision. This discrepancy between prediction and experiment has been attributed to the nonlinear properties of the LGMD's membrane potential equation. A new model, called the noisy ψ model, has been proposed that incorporates these nonlinear properties and explains many of the experimental observations that could not be explained by the η-function alone. The noisy ψ model emphasizes the importance of signal integration in order to account for the experimental observations.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium ulcerans. It affects people of all ages and both sexes, but mostly children under 15 years of age. BU usually affects the limbs and can cause deformities if left untreated. BU occurs in tropical and subtropical regions near stagnant water bodies and marshlands. The transmission mode is unclear, but some studies suggest that an animal reservoir or insect vectors may be involved. BU can be diagnosed clinically by experienced health workers, but laboratory confirmation is also available. The treatment of BU has evolved from surgery to the use of specific antibiotics in association with controlled wound healing, physiotherapy, and nutritional and psychological support. Effective BU control began in Cameroon in 2002. In this article, we describe the national BU control programme (NBUCP) in Cameroon from its creation to 2014. We reviewed reports and data from 2001 to 2014 and calculated key BU control indicators. We found that the number of BU cases reported in Cameroon increased from 3,890 in 2001 to 4,810 in 2014. The detection rate dropped significantly from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. However, the number of BU endemic health districts increased from 2 to 64. The health system has been strengthened, and BU research and education have gained more interest in Cameroon. Although institutional BU control in Cameroon only began 30 years after the first cases were reported in 1969, a number of milestones have been attained. These would serve as stepping stones for charting the way forward and improving upon control activities in the country if the major challenge of resource allocation is dealt with.
This study investigated the effect of outcome valence (gains or losses) on confidence while participants learned through trial and error. Participants were more confident when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses, despite similar performance. The study found that the bias in confidence was driven by the context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the expected value of the options being learned. This bias could have important functional consequences in volatile environments.
This research article describes the identification of a novel interaction between a viral protein called nsP3 from the alphavirus group and two human host proteins called amphiphysin-1 and -2. The alphavirus genus contains several important human pathogens, including Sindbis virus and chikungunya virus. The research was conducted using an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay, which showed that nsP3 binds to both amphiphysin-1 and -2. This interaction was confirmed by immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting. Additionally, the study found that amphiphysin-1 is important for the replication of the alphavirus SFV, and that amphiphysin-2 plays a role in regulating the protein synthesis of the virus. The results of this study suggest that amphiphysin-1 and -2 may be potential targets for the development of antiviral therapies against alphaviruses.
The article "Diversity of the fungal pathogen causing chromoblastomycosis in Brazil" is a scientific paper that describes the diversity of the fungal species that cause chromoblastomycosis in Brazil. This disease is caused by fungi that live in soil and plants, and can infect humans through cuts or abrasions on the skin. The paper includes a detailed description of 123 strains of fungi collected from people with chromoblastomycosis in different parts of Brazil. The authors used genetic sequencing to determine the identity of the fungi, and found that there were four main species of fungi causing chromoblastomycosis in Brazil. These species were Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Fonsecaea monophora, Fonsecaea nubica, and Fonsecaea pugnacius. The authors also found evidence of two new species of fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis, and discussed the clinical significance of each of these species. This information is important because it helps doctors and other medical professionals understand the diversity of fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis, and how to better diagnose and treat this disease.
In this study, we found that infection with Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that causes food poisoning and can invade human cells, causes DNA damage in HeLa cells and in mouse spleens and peritoneum. We also found that Listeria dampens the DNA damage response (DDR) by inhibiting the signaling pathway that leads to phosphorylation of H2AX on serine 139 (γH2AX), a marker of DNA damage. This inhibition is mediated by the bacterial protein Listeriolysin O (LLO). In addition, we found that inhibiting the DDR increases bacterial infection in vitro and in vivo. Our study reveals a subversion of the DDR during infection by Listeria and a role for the DDR in blocking bacterial proliferation.
Here is the lay summary of the provided content: The study demonstrates that the BRD4 bromodomain is a critical factor for HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections. The authors used an epigenetic screening library to identify small molecules that affect HSV infections. They found that a BRD4 bromodomain inhibitor significantly enhanced HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections. The authors then studied the mechanism of action and found that BRD4 plays a role in transcription factor association with HSV gene promoters, leading to increased viral replication. The study provides new insights into the role of BRD4 in HSV infections and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for treating viral infections.
The aim of this study was to investigate the bacterial communities present in the mouths of children suffering from noma, a devastating ancient disease that causes severe facial disfigurement in more than 140,000 children every year. This is done by comparing the microbial communities found in the mouths of children with noma to those of children with a related condition called Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis and healthy controls. The study found that the microbial communities found in the mouths of children with noma were different from those found in healthy controls and children with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis. The study identified several species that are more abundant in the mouths of children with noma and could potentially be involved in the development of the disease. These findings could help in understanding the etiology of noma and developing new treatments for the disease.
Quorum sensing is a process used by bacteria to communicate with each other. During this process, bacteria exchange a chemical signal known as an autoinducer, which allows them to coordinate their behavior as a group. NprR is a protein involved in quorum sensing in Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium that infects insects. The protein NprR binds to an autoinducer molecule and blocks its ability to bind to its target protein, preventing quorum sensing.
Proteochemometric modeling is a data-driven, predictive approach that is used to identify resistance in HIV-1 drug mutants. The current study aims to train single PCM models for each of the three major HIV-1 drug classes (protease inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) using the AVG assay data. The goal is to achieve a robust and generalizable model that can be applied to unseen clinical mutants. To achieve this, the study uses a combination of sequence-based and physiochemical-based descriptors to predict the change in pIC50 of HIV-1 mutants. The resulting models show promise in predicting the resistance of HIV-1 drug mutants, with low RMSE values and high R02 scores. These models can be used to predict the resistance of new mutants that have not yet been tested in clinical settings, making them a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers in the field of HIV-1 drug development.
Chemotaxis is a process by which cells move towards a source of attractants, such as food or drugs. In order to understand this process, scientists have created many different models to explain how it works. Most of these models focus on a "compass" inside the cell that helps it to steer towards the attractant. However, a recent study proposed a different mechanism, called the pseudopod-centered model, which suggests that chemotaxis is driven by the movement of the cell's pseudopods, which are small, branching projections that allow the cell to move forward. Using a computer model, the study showed that the pseudopod-centered model could explain a wide range of data about cell movement and chemotaxis. It also made a prediction that was tested using live Dictyostelium cells, and the results agreed with the model very well. This study suggests that chemotaxis is driven by a mechanism that is much simpler than previously thought.
This study examines the role of flea early-phase transmission (EPT) of Yersinia pestis (the bacterium that causes plague) by analyzing the location of bacteria in the flea digestive tract following feeding on infected blood. The results suggest that fleas can transmit Y. pestis by EPT when they have consumed blood from rodents with high titers of bacteria in their blood. This discovery may have important implications for the epidemiology of plague, as it suggests that fleas could transmit Y. pestis to humans during the early stages of an outbreak, even when the human population has not yet developed immunity to the pathogen.
The coding capacity of a neural network is the number of independent units of information that can be reliably transmitted from the input to the output layer. It is not a constant value, but depends on the stimuli and the correlations among them. The more diverse the stimuli are, the more independent information can be transmitted. The higher the correlation among the stimuli, the more coding capacity can be gained by tuning the correlation coefficients. We use a simplified mathematical model to show how this can occur in a 2-pool neural network with different correlations in each pool. For a range of stimulus and correlation values, we show that the coding capacity of a 2-pool network can be increased significantly beyond that of a single-pool network, by more than a factor of 10. We also show that in a 2-pool network, the error rate can be suppressed by up to a factor of 100, even for very small correlations in each pool. We show that this effect is not limited to a 2-pool model, but occurs in a generalized case of a -pool network. This result is significant for understanding the potential of a population of neurons to transmit information, and has implications for how information is processed in the brain.
Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The O-polysaccharide (O-PS) antigen on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of V. cholerae is responsible for the rapid onset of profuse watery diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and death. The O-PS antigen is composed of a specific sequence of sugars, and the serotype is defined by this sequence. In this study, we used squarate-linked oligosaccharides to create a new conjugate vaccine for cholera. The vaccine was created using a synthetic oligosaccharide containing a sequence similar to the O-PS of V. cholerae O1 Inaba strain, which was conjugated to the tetanus toxoid (TT) using squarate linkages. The vaccine was tested in mice, and it was found to induce a strong immune response against the O-PS antigen, including the production of specific antibodies and memory B cells. The vaccine was also found to protect mice from a wild-type V. cholerae infection in a survival challenge assay. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the new conjugate vaccine is effective and safe, and it could potentially be used to protect against cholera in humans.
In this study, researchers investigate the relationship between the presence of Wuchereria bancrofti microfilariae (Mf) and the rate of positive results on ICT tests. The study was conducted in four regions of Cameroon, where the distribution of loiasis and mansonellosis is highly variable. The researchers found a significant positive association between the prevalence of L. loa Mf and the rate of ICT positivity. However, there was no association between the prevalence of M. perstans Mf and the rate of ICT positivity. The study suggests that the main confounding factor for positive ICT test results may be high levels of L. loa Mf in the blood. These findings have important implications for the mapping and elimination of LF in Africa.
This article provides a detailed description of the ultrastructure of SARS-CoV–infected cells using electron tomography. The authors discovered that coronavirus DMVs are integrated into a unique reticulovesicular network of modified ER membranes, which also includes convoluted membranes. They also found that viral replicase subunits are primarily localized to the convoluted membranes, while dsRNA is mainly found in the DMV interior. The authors suggest that further studies of this unique replication network will help to dissect the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and its virus–host interactions.
This study presents an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, named enhanced suberin1 (esb1-1), which has altered root suberin content and composition. The esb1-1 mutant has 20-50% less C20-C24 aliphatic monomers in root suberin, resulting in a reduced transpiration rate, reduced wilting after water withdrawal, and a perturbation of the shoot ionome. Grafting experiments confirmed that these phenotypes are the result of elevated root suberin. The authors used several approaches to study the role of suberin in regulating radial transport, including elemental analysis, microarray analysis, and in vivo staining of suberin. This study provides direct evidence that suberin acts in the root as a barrier to the extracellular transport of both water and mineral ions.
The single photon response (SPR) of rod photoreceptors is characterized by a high degree of variability. We have developed a computational model of the SPR that accounts for the stochastic nature of the process. The model is based on the kinetics of the rhodopsin phosphorylation, arrestin binding, and transducin activation in different photoreceptor species, including mice with different numbers of rhodopsin phosphorylation sites. The model reproduces the experimental variability of the SPR, and suggests that it is due to the stochastic nature of the process, rather than the number of rhodopsin phosphorylation sites. We have also determined the parameters of the model, based on experimental data for wild-type and mutant mice.
Stochastic reaction networks are used to model systems within cells that involve low-copy molecules. However, these models need to account for intrinsic stochasticity and the fluctuations in the intracellular environment, or extrinsic noise, which also affects the observed variability among isogenic cells. Several recent studies have attempted to separate intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations, either through dual-reporter measurements or by modeling extrinsic noise through parameters of a kinetic model. These approaches increase the model's dimensionality, making it difficult to analyze. In this work, we develop a general mathematical framework for uncoupling a network from its dynamic environment by incorporating only the environment's effect onto the network into a new model. We derive the corresponding process- and master equations and show how stochastic simulations can be performed. We demonstrate the significance of the approach using several case studies. The resulting model emulates the effect of extrinsic noise through its own stochasticity, leading to a self-exciting process.
A new closed-loop brain-machine interface (BMI) training architecture called adaptive optimal feedback-controlled (OFC) point process filter (PPF) was developed in this study. The architecture consists of two main components: a point process model of the spikes and an optimal feedback control model of the brain behavior in BMI control. The point process model allows for spike-event-based BMI control and adaptation with every spike event, while the optimal feedback control model infers the user's motor intention during closed-loop decoder adaptation and is used to design an automated and dynamic assisted training paradigm. The architecture was evaluated in closed-loop BMI experiments in a non-human primate, and the results show that spike-event-based adaptation results in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared with batch-based methods, and the OFC intention estimation improves BMI performance compared with existing methods. Additionally, the architecture extends control to tasks beyond those used for CLDA training, such as a target-jump task and a target-to-target task.
The visual system of animals is remarkably robust to changes in the statistical properties of the environment. This robustness can be seen in the way that neurons in the retina respond similarly to stimuli of different spatial and temporal correlations. However, the actual degree of similarity in the responses of neurons to stimuli of different correlations has not been fully characterized. Here, we present an analysis of the responses of retinal ganglion cells to stimuli of a wide range of spatial and temporal correlations. Our analysis reveals a surprising degree of similarity in the responses of neurons to stimuli of different correlations. This similarity appears to be due to a small number of factors, including temporal processing, changes in the temporal kernels of the neurons, and changes in the surround inhibition. We also find that changes in the center location of the receptive field have a significant effect on the responses of neurons. Our analysis suggests that the visual system may have evolved to be robust to changes in the statistical properties of the environment by optimizing a small number of parameters.
The paper presents a novel method for predicting genetic interactions in yeast, specifically synthetic lethal interactions, using a multi-network decision tree approach. The method uses a combination of 152 SL-independent and 15 SL-dependent features to predict SL interactions between gene pairs. The method is trained on a balanced dataset of 9994 SL and 125,509 non-SL interactions, and evaluated using cross-validation and an independent test set. The results show that the method outperforms previous approaches in predicting SL interactions, and is capable of predicting other types of genetic interactions as well. The method is implemented as a web server that is freely available to the public.

Malaria is a serious disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium falciparum, which has a complex developmental cycle involving different intra- and extracellular environments. In order to survive in these different environments, the parasite needs to maintain a delicate redox balance. To do this, the parasite uses several redox-related proteins that act as antioxidants, such as glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. These proteins are found in different subcellular compartments of the parasite, such as the apicoplast and the parasitophorous vacuole. The apicoplast is a unique organelle found in the parasite that is thought to be involved in photosynthesis. The parasitophorous vacuole is a membrane-bound compartment where the parasite grows and replicates. The distribution of redox-related proteins in different subcellular compartments allows the parasite to maintain a balanced redox state, which is important for its survival and virulence. Understanding the redox state of the parasite could lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat malaria.
A new coarse-grained model is used to study the electrostatic interactions of PUMA and Mcl-1 in the coupled folding and binding process. The results show that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the early stages of binding and in the formation of the encounter complex. The model can be used to predict the results of mutational studies and provides important insights into the mechanisms of protein-protein interactions.
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that regulate gene expression by binding to discrete PcG response elements (PREs) that recruit PRC2, which trimethylates lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), a mark that is recognized by PcG proteins. In Drosophila, PREs are located tens of kilobases away from their target genes, and they cluster together within large Polycomb domains marked with H3K27me3. Within these domains, PREs may interact to form three-dimensional (3D) structures inside the cell nucleus. PC and PH are two important members of the PcG protein family, and they localize in PC bodies that contain PREs. The motion of PC bodies is influenced by long-range motions of chromatin domains containing H3K27me3 and by fast and highly constrained motions. The nuclear distribution of PC bodies and chromatin domains changes during development, and this change may contribute to the maintenance of stable gene silencing.
Somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been linked to aging and other age-related diseases in humans and animals. However, the precise role of mtDNA mutations in these processes is still unclear. The article by Zhu et al. aims to shed light on this by using next-generation sequencing technology to measure mtDNA mutation loads in normal and prematurely aging mice. The authors found that the total number of mtDNA mutations was increased in the prematurely aging mtDNA mutator mice, but not in wild-type mice as they aged. They also found that the majority of these mutations were caused by replication errors during development. These findings challenge the idea that mtDNA mutations accumulate during aging and suggests that the role of mtDNA mutations in aging may be more complex than previously thought.
In this study, the authors investigated the ion-coupling mechanism of the ATP synthase from Fusobacterium nucleatum, a bacterium that uses glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of sodium ions (Na+). The authors found that the ATP synthase of F. nucleatum is directly coupled to ATP synthesis via an F1Fo-ATP synthase with a novel Na+ recognition motif, shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free-energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicated that Na+ specificity is physiologically relevant. Furthermore, the authors demonstrated that Na+ has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites. They also determined the structure of the c11 ring of the enzyme at two different pH levels, and found that Na+ ions occupy all binding sites and that there are two carboxylates instead of one that mediate ion binding. This finding implies that a proton is concurrently bound to all sites, although Na+ alone drives the rotary mechanism. The authors concluded that their study provides a basis for drug-design efforts against this opportunistic pathogen.
The study examined the effect of TCR ligand potency on in vivo T cell immunity by tracking CD4+ T cell activation, effector, and memory responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting a range of TCR/pMHC half-lives and in vitro T cell activation potencies. Contrary to predictions from in vitro studies, the study found that optimal in vivo T cell responses occur to ligands with intermediate TCR/pMHC half-lives. The attenuation of in vivo responses to the ligand exhibiting the longest TCR/pMHC half-life was associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling, expansion, and function over a broad range of time points. This study reveals a level of control over T cell activation in vivo not recapitulated in in vitro assays and highlights the importance of considering in vivo efficacy of TCR ligands as part of vaccine design.
We have sequenced the genome of Nectria haematococca, a filamentous fungus that causes tomato and potato late blight disease, and the most destructive plant disease in the world. We have used this genome to better understand the evolution of the species, and to identify genes involved in specific adaptations to different environments. This genome will also be useful in the development of new methods for controlling late blight disease.
The article describes a new method to visualize and analyze the final steps of herpesvirus particle transport and exocytosis. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, the authors imaged the movement of viral particles in live PK15 cells, and found that particles are tightly confined at the plasma membrane before and after exocytosis. They also observed that viral exocytosis events occur most frequently near plasma membrane patches of LL5β, part of a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. The authors suggest that this new method could be useful for studying the mechanisms underlying virus egress and identifying novel drug targets for antiviral therapy.
The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health. It has been linked to various immune and inflammatory conditions. Previous studies on the association of enterobiasis (pinworm infection) and the gut microbiome have shown contradictory results. In order to understand this relationship, we recruited 109 primary school children (first and fourth grades) from Taichung, Taiwan, and collected their fecal samples. We compared the gut microbiota diversity and composition of children with and without pinworm infection. We also studied the intestinal cytokine and SIgA levels in these children. Our results showed that pinworm infection increased gut microbiota diversity and led to an increased abundance of Actinobacteria and a decreased abundance of Fusobacteria. Furthermore, we found that the intestinal SIgA level was lower in children with pinworm infection. After treating these children with mebendazole, we observed an increase in the abundance of Bifidobacterium, which is a probiotic bacterium. These findings suggest that childhood exposure to pinworms may have protective effects against autoimmunity. However, further research is needed to confirm these results and to understand the underlying mechanisms.
In this paper, the authors describe the results of an epistatic genome-wide association (GWA) analysis of root length in Arabidopsis thaliana, a small plant species commonly used as a model organism in plant biology research. The authors used a collection of 93 wild-collected accessions of A. thaliana to perform the analysis, and found that several pairs of loci displayed significant epistatic interactions that could not be explained by additive genetic effects alone. The authors also used a new statistical method to evaluate the robustness of the GWA associations in the small population, and estimated that half of the pairs were at risk of being false positives. The authors validated several of the epistatic associations using T-DNA insertion mutants, and identified functional candidate genes that affected root length in four regions that were part of three pairs. The authors conclude that their results illustrate the value of epistatic GWA analyses for revealing novel loci contributing to complex traits in small, inbred populations.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is a small section of our DNA that is inherited only from our mothers. It is known that certain mutations in mtDNA can cause human diseases such as inherited metabolic disease. Some of these mutations occur many times and affect different groups of people. It is not clear whether this association is limited to a few examples or is more common. To investigate this question, researchers analyzed 30,619 mtDNA sequences from people around the world. They determined whether these sequences contained known disease-causing mutations and assigned a score to each mutation based on its likelihood of causing disease. The researchers found that certain mutations were more likely to occur in specific mtDNA haplogroups (groups of people with a similar genetic background). They also found that some mutations were associated with specific haplogroups but others were found across all groups. The researchers also found that younger mtDNA sequences tended to have more disease-causing mutations and that people with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected by chance. These findings suggest that the genetic background of a person is important in determining which mtDNA mutations will occur and which will cause disease. This provides an explanation for why certain ethnic groups are at lower risk for mtDNA diseases. The researchers also provided a list of known pathogenic mtDNA mutations that could be used to predict which people are at risk for mtDNA diseases. This list will be useful for researchers, medical professionals, and genetic counselors to make informed decisions about mtDNA testing and treatment options.
Collective cell migration is a critical process in development, disease, and regeneration. Here, we use a phase field approach to model collective cell migration on a narrow microfabricated stripe. In our model, we include cell-cell adhesion, volume exclusion, and the polarity of cells, which determines the cell front and back. We also include a minimal chemical model for Rac that includes cell-cell contact-induced inhibition of Rac. Our model reproduces the major outcomes of cell-cell collisions, including sticking, repulsion, and reversal. These results are robust to variations in the parameters of the model. By systematically varying the parameters of our model, we find that the degree of CIL is a critical parameter that determines the outcomes of cell-cell collisions. We also find that the strength of adhesion between cells is a key parameter that affects the outcome of cell-cell collisions. Our model provides a framework for understanding the outcomes of cell-cell collisions in collective cell migration and for making predictions about how changes in cell-cell adhesion will affect these outcomes.
The dissociation mechanism of the mixed disulfide complex of thioredoxin (Trx) and arsenate reductase (ArsC) has been subject to much debate, and several dissociation pathways have been proposed over the past 20 years. The present work investigates the dissociation mechanism of the Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide complex using molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanics calculations, site-directed mutagenesis, and chemical reactions. The results show that the mixed disulfide complex is formed by two consecutive reactions, in which the Cys32 thiol of Trx attacks the Cys82-Cys89 disulfide of ArsC and is further attacked by the Cys29 thiol of ArsC. The data from the present work support a new mechanism for the dissociation of the Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide complex, in which the Cys32 thiol of Trx acts as a nucleophile and attacks the Cys29-Cys89 mixed disulfide of ArsC to form a new disulfide bond between Cys29 and Cys89 of ArsC. The proposed mechanism is supported by site-directed mutagenesis experiments, which show that the Cys32 thiol of Trx can form a new disulfide bond with the Cys29 thiol of ArsC. The present work provides a new view on the dissociation mechanism of the Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide complex and may help to understand the physiological function of this complex in the redox reactions of living organisms.
In this study, the authors investigated how uncertainty in one's own preferences might affect the way that people change their tastes in response to social influence. They used a novel task to measure people's preferences for immediate rewards versus delayed rewards, and then manipulated these preferences to make them more or less similar to those of other people. They found that the degree to which people's preferences changed in response to social influence was related to their uncertainty about their own preferences. The authors suggest that this uncertainty might explain the tendency of people to conform to the preferences of others in social situations.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of the mucin-like protein, Msb2p, in filamentous growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They use a secretion profiling method to identify genes that are secreted from cells in response to Msb2p overexpression. Through this approach, they identify 13 genes that are differentially secreted in response to Msb2p overexpression. They then validate the role of these genes in filamentous growth using various genetic and biochemical approaches. The study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying filamentous growth in yeast and identifies potential targets for future therapeutic interventions.
In this study, we analyzed the evolution of sexual development in five species of Sordariomycetes fungi (Ascomycota, Fungi) using RNA sequencing. We focused on the five developmental stages of sexual fruiting bodies and compared gene expression across species. We identified a set of 155 orthologs with significantly different expression across the five stages in the five species and selected the top 100 genes based on the largest fold change in expression. We knocked out each of the top 100 genes and examined the resulting phenotypes to identify genes involved in sexual development. We found that 70 genes showed phenotypes, 54 of which were associated with the development of fruiting bodies, and 16 genes showed phenotypes associated with the development of perithecia. We used Bayesian networks to explore the relationships between these genes and found that genes involved in sexual development were linked to each other, forming a gene network. We then used the same approach to analyze gene expression in late sexual development and identified 70 genes with phenotypes. We found that genes involved in late sexual development were linked to each other, forming a separate gene network. These gene networks may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying sexual development in fungi.
We explored the introduction of transgenes and other macromolecules into eggs of the schistosome worm using square wave electroporation. We found that square wave electroporation was more efficient than soaking alone for the transduction of schistosome eggs by messenger RNA encoding luciferase and by pseudotyped retrovirus virions. This result implies that transduction of schistosome eggs by retroviruses can be improved by square wave electroporation.
The article presents a new method called the Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model for studying the dynamic properties of macromolecular assemblies. The model is applied to the GroEL-GroES protein chaperone system, which is involved in assisting protein folding. The authors use the PMT model to analyze the dynamic responses of different residues in the chaperone complex, specifically pivot, messenger, and anchor residues. They predict additional residues that play important functional roles in the chaperone system, which are supported by experimental results. The article also discusses the PMT model's ability to study signal transmission pathways in the chaperone system. The authors argue that their approach is more efficient and accurate than previous methods in studying the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies.
In this study, the authors identified a lectin-hypersensitive mutant of C. elegans, pmk-1 (km25), using a screen of a mutant library. They then used this mutant to identify the N-glycan structure recognized by the C. elegans lectin CGL-2. The authors found that CGL-2 recognizes a specific N-glycan structure, Fucα1-Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1, which is important for the development and survival of C. elegans. They also showed that the N-glycan structure recognized by CGL-2 is conserved in other animals, including humans. These findings suggest that CGL-2 may be a useful tool for studying the function of N-glycans in other animals.
The immune system is constantly exposed to pathogens and foreign substances that it reacts against. This process of recognizing, attacking, and eliminating pathogens is known as immunity. Immunity is essential for the survival of all multicellular organisms. Without it, microbes and parasites could easily take over and overwhelm the host.
The article describes a study evaluating the ability of CVB3, a virus that can cause myocarditis, to evade the host's immune response. The study found that CVB3 can effectively evade CD8+ T cell responses, but not CD4+ T cell responses, by inhibiting the presentation of its own antigens on MHC class I molecules. This finding may help explain why the virus is able to cause infections and may have implications for the development of new therapies for myocarditis caused by CVB3.
The paper discusses the results of a clinical trial that aimed to determine the efficacy of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) in treating leprosy Type 1 reactions (T1Rs), which can lead to nerve damage and disability. The study found that individuals treated with three doses of MP over three days and then oral prednisolone had a lower rate of deterioration in sensory function compared to those treated with oral prednisolone alone over 16 weeks. However, there was no significant difference in the rate of adverse events between the two groups. The study also demonstrated that half of the individuals with T1Rs and/or nerve function impairment required additional prednisolone despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids. The authors conclude that further research is needed to determine the optimal dose and duration of corticosteroid treatment for T1Rs, as well as the risk factors for recurrence of T1Rs and nerve function impairment during and after corticosteroid treatment.
The article investigates the effects of Treg, a type of immune cell, on CD8+ T cells in chronic HIV infection. The authors found that Treg from HIV+ patients did not significantly suppress the proliferation of autologous CD8+ T cells in response to viral antigens. However, Treg from HIV+ patients did inhibit the production of IFN-γ by autologous CD8+ T cells in response to CMV, EBV, and flu viral antigens. The authors suggest that this defective suppression of CD8+ T cells by Treg may contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cells and the inability of the immune system to effectively control HIV infection. The study highlights the complex and dynamic nature of the immune response to HIV infection, and the need for further research to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cells.
The current study aimed to evaluate the potential of recombinant WbGST as a vaccine against filarial infection caused by Wuchereria bancrofti. This was done by screening the sera of endemic and non-endemic individuals for the presence of anti-WbGST IgG antibodies using immunoblot analysis and indirect ELISA. Furthermore, the ability of anti-WbGST antibodies to neutralize the enzymatic activity of WbGST and kill B. malayi larvae in vitro was evaluated. The results of the study suggest that immunization with rWbGST could potentially be used as a protective strategy against filarial infections.
This study shows that the CRISPR/Cas9 technology is effective in generating gene-edited mice. The study further demonstrates that the CRISPR/Cas9 system has the potential to be used for gene editing in other species. The study provides a detailed description of the methods used to generate gene-edited mice, including the use of CRISPR/Cas9 RNAs and Cas9 protein. The study also provides information on the efficiency of the system in generating mutations, including the type and frequency of mutations. The study further demonstrates the potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology for gene therapy. Overall, the study provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in using the CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing.
Researchers have identified two Arabidopsis proteins, HRB1 and PP7, that play important roles in regulating stomatal aperture in response to blue light. They found that both proteins interact with each other and that the genetic and biochemical interactions between them are important for controlling stomatal aperture. The researchers also found that a mutation in the HRB1 gene leads to an increase in stomatal aperture, while a mutation in the PP7 gene leads to a decrease in stomatal aperture. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the regulation of stomatal aperture in response to blue light.
In this study, the authors investigated the role of the Mediator complex in regulating gene expression in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They focused on the subunit MDT-15 and found that it plays a broader role in regulating gene expression than previously thought. Specifically, they found that MDT-15 regulates genes involved in various metabolic processes, including fatty acid metabolism and detoxification of certain chemicals. They also found that MDT-15 interacts with the nuclear hormone receptor NHR-49 to regulate genes involved in cholesterol and steroid metabolism. These findings suggest that MDT-15 plays a critical role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis in C. elegans and that it may be a potential therapeutic target for treating metabolic diseases.
We study the topological properties of simplicial complexes that are produced by the overlaps between place fields covering an environment. The hypothesis that drives this project is that the hippocampus encodes a topological map. To begin our investigation, we ask whether the topological map produced by the place cells captures the most basic topological features of the environment, namely, the number of holes in it. We use simplicial homology with coefficients to count the loops in the simplicial complex, which correspond to the number of holes in the environment. We show that for a fixed number of place cells and place field sizes, there are combinations of parameters that result in map formation failure. We also find that as the number of place cells increases, the probability of successful map formation increases exponentially. Finally, we find that place cell co-activity plays a key role in the formation of topological maps.
This study describes the discovery of several host genes that are required for HCV replication. These genes were identified by performing RNA interference (RNAi) screening on 140 genes involved in membrane trafficking and then validating the results using individual siRNAs. The RNAi screening identified several genes that are required for infectious HCV production, but not for HCV entry or RNA replication. These include genes involved in lipid trafficking, kinases, and endosome/lysosome function. The study also used live cell imaging to track the movement of a tagged version of the core protein, providing insight into the mechanisms of HCV egress.
The article presents a study that investigates the role of Grb10, an imprinted gene, in the tumorigenesis process. The authors show that loss of Grb10 expression is associated with neurofibromin mutations and leads to increased Ras signaling and proliferation in tumor cells. The article provides details on the methods used to conduct the study, including the analysis of polymorphisms in human and mouse tumors, and the generation of retroviral and lentiviral constructs. The authors also discuss the importance of considering the parental origin of imprinted genes in disease and tumorigenesis.
In this study, we used a Bayesian approach to modeling fear learning. Fear learning is the process by which a person learns to associate a stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus, which can be aversive. We used a mathematical model that describes how a person learns to associate a stimulus with a US, and we applied this model to different types of data. We used skin conductance data, which measures changes in the electrical conductance of the skin, and pupil dilation data, which measures changes in the size of the pupil. We compared different models to determine which one best describes the data. We also used a control experiment to determine the best timing of the model's response to a CS.
The present study is a continuation of our previous work aimed at dissecting the septation and conidiation signaling pathways in filamentous fungi. We have identified a suppressor of septation, PomA, by a combination of genetic crosses, UV mutagenesis, and NGS to screen for mutations. We have found that deletion of PomA leads to defective septation and conidiation. PomA is a protein kinase that is a negative regulator of the septation and conidiation process, and its function is closely related to the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the MAPK pathway and PomA are involved in conidiation under both normal and stressful conditions. Our findings have provided new insights into the septation and conidiation process in filamentous fungi.
Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease caused by a parasite that can be found in many countries, including Brazil. It can manifest as simple skin lesions or as severe outcomes such as mucosal lesions, which can be life-threatening. Several factors have been associated with the severity of the disease and the development of lesions, including the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) infecting Leishmania (LRV1). In the present study, 156 patients who attended Rondonia's Hospital of Tropical Medicine with both leishmaniasis clinical diagnoses and molecular diagnoses were investigated. The clinical diagnosis were confirmed by PCR targeting hsp70 and kDNA DNA sequences, and the species causing the infection were determined by HSP70 PCR-RFPL. The presence of LRV1 was tested by RT-PCR. The results showed that LRV1 was present in L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. amazonensis, L. lainsoni, and inconclusive samples. Of the patients, 71.1% of mucosal lesions were positive for LRV1, and 28.9% were negative. In cutaneous lesions, 36.7% were positive, and 63.3% were negative for LRV1. The ratio P (ML|LRV1+) /P (ML|LRV1-) was 2.93 (CI95% 1.57…5.46; p<0.001), indicating that LRV1 is not the only factor contributing to the disease outcome. The study also identified different Leishmania species that cause the infection in the region, including L. braziliensis, L. guyanensis, L. lainsoni, and L. amazonensis.
Infection with pneumococci can cause severe disease in humans, particularly in children and elderly individuals. The innate immune system can effectively eliminate pneumococci at the initial stages of infection. However, if not eliminated, pneumococci can cause invasive disease, which can lead to life-threatening pneumonia and sepsis. The adaptive immune system, particularly type I interferons, has been shown to play a crucial role in host defense against pneumococcal infection. In this study, we show that the adaptive immune response mediated by type I interferon plays a critical role in preventing the progression of pneumococcal infection from a localized lung infection to invasive disease. Our study demonstrates that IFN-β prevents pneumococci from traversing epithelial barriers, which is critical for preventing invasive disease. We also show that IFN-β inhibits PAF receptor expression on lung and endothelial cells, which is critical for preventing pneumococcal invasion. Our findings have important implications for the development of new interventions to prevent the progression of pneumococcal infection and reduce the burden of pneumococcal disease.
This study proposes a new neural network model that is capable of more complex pattern recognition tasks involving both approach and avoidance behavior. The model has multiple layers of neurons with different synaptic plasticity rules, and it utilizes a combination of rewarded and non-rewarded STDP to learn from the environment. The model was tested on a virtual foraging task, where the virtual agent moved through a grid of food particles and had to learn to distinguish between edible and toxic food particles. The model demonstrated better performance on the task compared to previous models that only used one layer of neurons with rewarded STDP.
This article describes the function of the ELF5 transcription factor in the development of breast cancer and its association with resistance to anti-estrogen therapy. ELF5 is a key regulator of the mammary gland lineage, and its expression is elevated in breast cancers, particularly in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) tumors. The authors demonstrate that ELF5 is required for the development of the mammary gland lineage and for the formation of ductal structures in mice. They also show that ELF5 is overexpressed in breast cancer cells and is associated with resistance to anti-estrogen therapy. The authors identify myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) as a key cell type that promotes ELF5 expression and anti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer cells. They also demonstrate that MDSCs can be selectively depleted using anti-Ly6G antibodies, which leads to a reduction in ELF5 expression and increased sensitivity to anti-estrogen therapy. Overall, the article provides important insights into the role of ELF5 in breast cancer and identifies potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this disease.
Our current understanding of how genes are regulated at the transcriptional level is limited. In this paper, we introduce a mechanistic model of gene expression that takes into account the connection patterns of two DNA loops and the communication between them. We propose a mapping method for three fundamental connection patterns: alternating loops, nested loops, and side-by-side loops. Using the mapping method, we establish a multistate model of gene expression at the transcriptional level. Our model reveals that alternating loops increase gene expression while nested loops reduce it. Furthermore, we show that the facilitated-tracking mechanism is the dominant mechanism for enhancer-promoter communication, and we discuss its advantages in terms of gene regulation.
Researchers have designed RNA molecules that repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. These RNA molecules, called tiRNAs, are made up of a stem-loop structure and are designed to bind to a specific target RNA sequence, inhibiting its translation. To design effective tiRNAs, researchers need to consider various factors, including the thermodynamics and structure of the RNA molecules. By designing and testing different tiRNAs, researchers have been able to develop a predictive framework for the design of effective RNA molecules that can be used to modulate gene expression. Overall, these findings have important implications for the development of new RNA-based therapeutic agents and the engineering of metabolic pathways in microorganisms.
Our study demonstrates that when the summed activity of a local neuronal group exceeds a threshold, its activity pattern can be reproduced at other cortical sites via fast synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs can last up to hundreds of milliseconds and mark periods of loss-less spread of temporal and amplitude information much like action potentials at the single-cell level. They also have an additional degree of freedom in their waveforms, which provides a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information and allows identification of particular associations. These results are analogous to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks.
A study published in the journal eLife has identified 25 essential genes in the yeast S. pombe that affect the size of the nucleus during interphase. The authors screened a collection of S. pombe gene deletion mutants and found that 25 mutants had a significantly different nuclear size compared to wild type cells. The authors analyzed the genes involved and found that RNA processing and LINC complexes play a role in nuclear size control. They also identified genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and cell wall organization that affect nuclear size. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of nuclear size control and may have implications for understanding diseases associated with nuclear abnormalities.
The paper introduces a mathematical framework for understanding the effects of deep brain stimulation on the brain's neural oscillations. It focuses on a particular type of neural oscillation called the beta oscillation, which is associated with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. The authors use a simplified model of neurons, called the Kuramoto model, to describe the behavior of neural oscillations. They then use this model to understand how deep brain stimulation affects the neural oscillations. The authors show that the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation depends on the phase of the neural oscillation when it is applied. They also show that the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation depends on the amplitude of the neural oscillation. The authors provide a theoretical framework for understanding the effects of deep brain stimulation on neural oscillations and compare their theoretical predictions to experimental data.
The article describes the development and evaluation of a new method called "Biompha-LAMP" for detecting S. mansoni in experimentally infected snails. The method uses a set of six primers that target a specific region of S. mansoni DNA in a process called LAMP (Loop-mediated Amplification Protocol). The LAMP assay is simple, fast, and sensitive, and can be used to detect S. mansoni DNA in individual snails and pooled samples. The study found that Biompha-LAMP was able to detect S. mansoni DNA in all groups of snails, even in low-grade infections. The assay also found to be specific and sensitive. The article concludes that Biompha-LAMP has the potential to be an effective tool for screening infected snails in endemic areas, and it could be adapted to large-scale field surveys. The article's content is important for public health, as it describes a new method for detecting schistosomiasis, which can help in the control and elimination of the disease.
This paper presents the results of a costing study of dengue control activities and dengue hospitalizations in Colombo district, Sri Lanka, during the epidemic year of 2012. The study was conducted using a combination of activity-based costing and ingredients approach, and the costs were divided into recurrent and capital costs. The study found that personnel costs accounted for the largest shares of the total costs of dengue control activities (79%) and hospitalizations (46%). The results indicated a per capita cost of US$0.42 for dengue control activities and an average cost of US$216-609 for pediatric cases and US$196-866 for adult cases according to disease severity and treatment setting. This study provides evidence to support the allocation of more resources to dengue control activities and hospitalization costs in Sri Lanka.
Scientists have studied the ancestry of people from Europe and have found that most of their ancestors came from the Near East and spread into Europe during the Neolithic era. They did this by analyzing a particular type of DNA called Y-chromosomal DNA, which is passed down from father to son. By examining the patterns of this type of DNA, the scientists found that the Y-chromosomal lineage called haplogroup R1b1b2 had a single source in the Near East and spread into Europe via Anatolia during the Neolithic era. This finding supports the idea that the spread of agriculture from the Fertile Crescent in the Near East led to a major cultural and genetic shift in Europe.
The simulation results show that for the 10° target, the learning rate of the model is much lower than that of the 150° target. This is consistent with previous findings that subjects tend to produce larger endpoint errors for more distant targets [1, 35]. However, the finding that the learning rate is higher for the 150° target conflicts with the previous finding that subjects tend to have lower learning rates for more distant targets [47, 54]. The authors suggest that this inconsistency may be due to the difference in the type of task used in the previous studies, with the previous studies using two-dimensional reaching tasks and the current study using three-dimensional reaching tasks. The authors also suggest that this inconsistency may be due to the difference in the type of visual perturbation used in the previous studies, with the previous studies using visual perturbations that were orthogonal to the direction of movement, and the current study using visual perturbations that were in the same direction as the direction of movement. The authors also suggest that this inconsistency may be due to the difference in the type of motor noise used in the previous studies, with the previous studies using a motor noise model that was based on a Gaussian distribution, and the current study using a motor noise model that was based on a power law distribution. Overall, the simulation results show that the learning rate of a model based on the optimal feedback gain can vary depending on the task parameters.
NF-κB is a crucial transcription factor that is involved in cell survival, proliferation, and inflammation. It is activated by various extracellular signals, including cytokines, viral infection, and cell damage. NF-κB regulates the expression of numerous target genes that are involved in the immune response, inflammation, and cell survival. In this study, we identified the role of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction in the regulation of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. We used a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques, including NMR, ITC, and genetic analysis, to study the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction. We found that RelA interacts with CBP/p300 through its TA2 domain, which is required for NF-κB-dependent gene expression. We also found that the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction is important for the recruitment of RelA to its target promoter sites. Our results provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of NF-κB-dependent gene expression.
The Time-Course Gene Set Analysis (TcGSA) is a new method that allows for analyzing changes in gene expression over time for predefined groups of genes, called gene sets, in longitudinal data sets. Unlike other methods, TcGSA can handle heterogeneity within gene sets and unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. It is a hypothesis-driven method that identifies gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. TcGSA allows for the comparison of time patterns of gene sets according to biological conditions. It is illustrated by its application to two real-life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial and data from a recent study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the simulation study, TcGSA exhibits good statistical properties, and an increased power compared to other approaches for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. TcGSA is made available for the community through an R package.
The Malaria Atlas Project is an international research initiative that aims to map the global distribution of malaria risk. The project has two main objectives: to provide accurate and detailed maps of the global burden of malaria, and to help inform evidence-based policies and interventions for the control and elimination of malaria. The project is led by a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and has partnerships with a number of other institutions and organizations, including the World Health Organization, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. To date, the project has generated a range of maps and data products, including maps of malaria incidence, prevalence, and mortality, as well as maps of the population at risk of malaria, and maps of the geographic distribution of different malaria species. These maps have been used to inform policies and interventions around the world, and have played a critical role in helping to shape the global malaria agenda.
S. aureus is a major cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). During SSTIs, S. aureus abscesses form early and the burden of bacteria is dependent upon a specific interaction with the ligand loricrin. Targeting ClfB using a model vaccine that induced both protective humoral and cellular responses, leads to protection during S. aureus skin infection. This study therefore identifies ClfB as an important antigen for future SSTI vaccines.
We develop a novel computational framework that integrates pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and viral dynamics to predict the per-contact prophylactic efficacy of antiretroviral drugs. This approach allows us to evaluate the efficacy of different drug regimens and adherence levels, and to identify the critical factors that determine the effectiveness of PrEP. Our framework provides a valuable tool for informing public health policy and improving PrEP implementation.
In this study, the authors report that Hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces autophagy by differentially regulating the expression of two proteins, Rubicon and UVRAG. They found that Rubicon inhibits the maturation of autophagosomes, while UVRAG stimulates the maturation of autophagosomes. The authors also showed that the expression of Rubicon is prompt, while the expression of UVRAG is delayed. This delay in UVRAG expression leads to the accumulation of autophagosomes in the early time points of HCV infection. The authors used several techniques, such as transfection, siRNA knockdown, and overexpression, to confirm their findings. They also demonstrated that HCV replication is enhanced by the inhibition of autophagosome maturation and reduced by the enhancement of autophagosome maturation. These findings provide insights into the role of autophagy in HCV replication and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HCV infection.
In this study, we have identified a novel gene, CyclinY-like 1 (Ccnyl1), that is highly expressed in the testis. We found that Ccnyl1 is highly homologous to CCNY, a subunit of the cyclin-dependent kinase complex, which is important for cell cycle regulation. Ccnyl1, however, is not found in any other tissues, suggesting that it may have a unique function. We also found that Ccnyl1 is not necessary for male fertility, as Ccnyl1-/- males were sterile due to defects in sperm motility and morphology. We then used mouse sperm to study the function of Ccnyl1 in sperm motility and morphology. We found that Ccnyl1 localizes to the plasma membrane and the midpiece of the flagellum in mature sperm. We also found that Ccnyl1 interacts with CDK16, a kinase that is important for sperm motility and morphology. We found that overexpression of Ccnyl1 could increase the kinase activity of CDK16 in vitro, and that knockdown of Ccnyl1 could decrease the kinase activity of CDK16 in vivo. These results suggest that Ccnyl1 may be important for sperm motility and morphology by increasing the kinase activity of CDK16.
Certain strains of E. coli can form vesicles called outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that contain toxins and other virulence factors. OMVs can interact with host cells and contribute to the pathogenesis of E. coli infections. This study aimed to investigate the interactions of OMVs from E. coli strain O157:H7 with human cells. The study found that OMVs from E. coli O157:H7 can attach to and enter human cells, and that OMVs containing the toxin EHEC hemolysin can cause cytotoxicity in vitro. The study also examined the mechanisms by which OMVs may enter cells, and found that OMVs can enter cells through clathrin- and caveolin-mediated endocytosis, as well as through direct fusion with the plasma membrane. The study also looked at the interactions of OMVs with endosomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and the cytoskeleton in human cells. The study concludes that E. coli OMVs can interact with human cells in a variety of ways, and that these interactions may play a role in the pathogenesis of E. coli infections.
Transcription is a complex process that involves many different proteins and steps. One of the steps in transcription is elongation, which is when the RNA polymerase (RNAPII) makes a long chain of RNA from the DNA. This step is important because it determines how much RNA is made and how quickly it is made. The RNAPII needs to move along the DNA in order to make the RNA, and it can only move at a certain speed. When the RNAPII moves too fast, it can make mistakes in the RNA that can cause problems later on. When the RNAPII moves too slow, it can take too long to make the RNA. Therefore, it is important for the RNAPII to move at just the right speed. In order to help the RNAPII move at the right speed, it can interact with different proteins. These proteins can either help the RNAPII move faster or slower, depending on what is needed. In this article, the authors study one of these proteins, called Cdk9, to learn more about how it works and how it affects the RNAPII.
This article presents a study on the evolutionary history of Yellow Fever Virus (YFV). The authors analyzed a dataset of 133 viral isolates from the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States. The dataset includes prM/E sequence data (670 nucleotides) for YFV from 37 human isolates, 21 mosquito isolates, and 4 vertebrate isolates. The authors performed phylogenetic analyses on the dataset and found that YFV can be divided into two geographic groups, with distinct viral lineages observed in Africa and the Americas. They also found that the American isolates are monophyletic, that the American isolates are divided into those from the east and west of the continent, and that the isolates from West Africa are most closely related to those from the Americas. The authors conclude that their findings provide compelling support for an initial introduction of YFV during the period of the slave trade and first contact between the two continents. They also note that the lack of evidence for subsequent traffic of viruses between the hemispheres since the advent of the post-vaccine era is likely a tribute to effective public health measures.
Pneumococcus is a bacterium that causes pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis in humans. It is a leading cause of death in children worldwide. Pneumococcus can spread from person to person and can also be transmitted from mother to child during birth. Scientists have found that pneumococcus can cause disease in an animal model that mimics human infection. In this model, the scientists found that pneumococcus must pass through a population bottleneck, or sharp reduction in population size, during infection. They also found that the bottleneck occurs when pneumococcus must pass through a population bottleneck during bloodstream infection. This finding may lead to new ways of preventing and treating pneumococcal disease.
The study aimed to identify recombinant proteins as antigens for screening human sera from Eastern Africa for exposure to Phlebotomus orientalis bites. Recombinant proteins derived from sequence data on P . orientalis secreted salivary proteins were produced using either bacterial or mammalian expression systems. Two recombinant proteins; mAG5 and mYEL1, were identified as the most promising antigens showing high correlation coefficients as well as good specificity in comparison to the whole salivary gland homogenate. The combination of both proteins led to a further increase of correlation coefficients as well as both positive and negative predictive values of P . orientalis exposure. This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P . orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins. The recombinant salivary proteins mYEL1 and mAG5 proved to be valid antigens for screening human sera from both Sudan and Ethiopia for exposure to P . orientalis bites. The utilization of equal amounts of these two proteins significantly increased the capability to detect anti-P . orientalis antibody responses.
Conjugation is the primary mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. It involves the transfer of a plasmid or other genetic element from a donor cell to a recipient cell. This process is mediated by a specialized protein complex known as the T4SS. There are two main types of T4SSs: the type I T4SS, which is found in Gram-negative bacteria, and the type II T4SS, which is found in Gram-positive bacteria. Recent studies have revealed that T4SSs can also be found in eukaryotic cells. These T4SSs are typically less well understood than their bacterial counterparts, but they are believed to play a crucial role in the horizontal transfer of genetic elements between eukaryotic cells.
The polo-like kinase Cdc5 helps the cell adapt to DNA damage. Cdc5, which plays a role in mitotic progression, works with the DNA damage checkpoint. The checkpoint prompts cells to stop dividing and repair the DNA damage. However, when the damage is severe or cannot be repaired, the checkpoint allows cells to adapt and resume the cell cycle.
In this study, the authors present a new method for simulating the dynamics of ions in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. The authors developed a 3-D version of the Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) scheme, which allows for more accurate simulations of the ECS on larger spatiotemporal scales. They also compared the KNP scheme to other methods, such as the volume conductor (VC) and diffusion-only (DO) schemes, to determine the conditions under which each method is appropriate. The authors used the KNP scheme to simulate the electrodiffusion of ions around a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell and found that the KNP scheme provided a more accurate representation of the ECS dynamics. The authors conclude that the KNP scheme can be used to simulate the ECS on larger spatiotemporal scales than previously thought possible, and that it can be used to study the dynamics of the ECS in the context of pathological conditions.
A study was conducted to demonstrate the potential consequences of a proposed budget cut to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for mosquito-borne disease surveillance and research. The study used a mathematical model to simulate the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics in an economically developed urban environment, such as Cairns, Queensland, Australia. The study found that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude in comparison to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the ones needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without consideration of the cost in human lives and well-being. The study provides a science-based justification for the re-assessment of the current proposal to slash the budget of the CDC vector-borne diseases program and emphasizes the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance.
A recent study aimed to understand the prevalence of dengue virus in semi-urban and rural western Nicaragua. To do this, the study prospectively collected data and samples from patients aged 1 year old or older presenting with acute febrile illness in the emergency department or adult and pediatric wards of the Hospital Escuela Oscar Danilo Rosales Arguello (HEODRA) in León, Nicaragua. Acute and convalescent sera were collected from patients and tested for dengue IgG and IgM and for the presence of the dengue virus. The study found that acute dengue was present in 38 (5.1%) of 740 febrile patients enrolled. The study highlights the need for better understanding of dengue transmission and prevention strategies in Nicaragua, particularly in rural areas where the virus can cause serious complications.
Plant nematodes are parasitic worms that invade and feed on the roots of plants, causing significant damage and reducing crop yields. In response to nematode invasion, plants activate their innate immunity, which involves the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). In this study, the authors used Arabidopsis thaliana to investigate the role of PRRs in nematode-induced immunity. They found that the nematode effector Heterorhabditis schachtii secreted a compound that triggered a PTI response in Arabidopsis through a BAK1-dependent mechanism. They also identified a LRR-RLK, NILR1, that was required for this response. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying nematode-induced immunity in plants.
The present study aimed to investigate the immunomodulatory properties of miltefosine, a drug currently used to treat Leishmaniasis. The authors observed that the drug induced an immunomodulatory response in S. mansoni-infected mice and Schistosoma mansoni worms, including changes in the tegument and release of antigens. The study provides new insights into the immunomodulatory properties of miltefosine and its potential as a treatment for schistosomiasis.
The article describes the identification and characterization of the bacterial receptor for human ferritin. Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in cells, and its identification as a potential target for bacterial pathogens is important. The authors used several methods to identify the receptor, including fluorescence microscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. They found that the receptor contains a unique combination of three protein domains, and that it binds to ferritin with a high affinity. The authors also showed that the receptor is necessary for the growth of the bacteria in iron-poor conditions, and that it is involved in the pathogenesis of the bacterium in the insect Galleria mellonella.
The circadian clock of the cyanobacterium S . elongatus is a system of three proteins that works together to generate a 24-hour rhythm. The main protein responsible for the clock is called KaiC, which forms a hexamer (a cluster of six molecules) that contains two domains called CI and CII. The clock runs when ATP is hydrolyzed, which causes KaiC to switch between two forms that have different phosphorylation patterns. This switching process allows the clock to keep track of time. The authors of this study have created a new mathematical model that explains how ATP hydrolysis drives the clock. They used a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate the behavior of the clock and found that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain is the main source of energy for the clock. They also found that the phosphorylation of the CII domain controls the timing of ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain.
The paper "A novel role of parkin in antiviral signaling" by [author 1], [author 2], and [author 3] describes a new function of the protein parkin in controlling the immune response to Hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is a common and dangerous liver virus that causes chronic hepatitis and can eventually lead to liver cancer. The paper explains that HBV uses a special protein called MAVS to suppress the immune response, and that the protein parkin has a role in stopping MAVS from doing this. The paper uses experiments and technical analysis to show how parkin does this and why it is important for the immune response. The paper also discusses the importance of understanding the role of parkin in this process, and how it could potentially be used to develop new treatments for HBV infection.
The research article presents the crystal structure of pfiT, a T-cell superantigen associated with inflammatory bowel disease, at a resolution of 1.7 Å. The study reveals that pfiT binds to HLA-DR1 and exhibits T-cell stimulatory activity. Additionally, the study demonstrates that pfiT can bind to HLA-DP and HLA-DQ, although with lower affinity compared to HLA-DR1. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms of T-cell activation and may have implications for the development of new therapies for inflammatory bowel disease.
Nanog is an important regulator of embryonic stem cells. Recently, it was discovered that Nanog expression can be regulated at the allelic level, meaning that one of the two Nanog copies in each cell is turned on while the other is turned off. This affects the distribution of Nanog in stem cell populations, leading to a bimodal distribution of Nanog expression. The distribution of Nanog in stem cell populations is influenced by several factors, including transcriptional noise and random partitioning of gene copies at cell division. The stochastic population balance equation framework was used to model the distribution of Nanog in stem cell populations and investigate the effects of allelic regulation. The model shows that allelic regulation is sufficient to produce a bimodal distribution of Nanog in stem cell populations, even in the absence of transcriptional noise. Additionally, the model was used to interpret the results of experiments using stem cell lines carrying a reporter gene knocked into one allelic locus. The model suggests that the bimodal distribution of Nanog observed in these experiments is not due to transcriptional noise, but rather is an artifact of the reporter gene knockout. Finally, the model was used to investigate the distribution of Nanog in Nanog+/− mutant embryonic stem cells. The model shows that these stem cells are able to maintain a group of self-renewing cells through allelic control, despite their higher propensity for differentiation and lower average content of NANOG protein.
This paper explores the costs and benefits of protein expression on microbial fitness. The authors use absolute and global proteomics data to determine environment-specific proteome utilization, which is combined with a genome-scale model of Escherichia coli that computes the cost and utility of the proteome on a per gene basis. The authors show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments, and that this un-utilized protein expression incurs a quantifiable fitness cost on cellular growth rates. They also show that reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. The authors classify the unused protein and find that it encodes several nutrient- and stress- preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. Thus, the authors suggest that unused protein expression is a source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change.
This article describes the genetic associations between common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Chinese, Malay, and Indian populations from Singapore. The study used genotype data from four case-control studies with a total of 3,072 Chinese, 1,405 Malay, and 977 Indian participants. The authors performed a meta-analysis of the individual case-control studies to identify SNPs associated with T2D. They identified 19 novel SNPs associated with T2D, including 12 SNPs in the HLA region, 2 SNPs in the CDKN2A/B region, 2 SNPs in the TCF7L2 region, 2 SNPs in the FTO region, and 1 SNP in the WFS1 region. The authors also confirmed the associations of previously reported T2D SNPs in the present study population. The findings of this study suggest that T2D is a complex disease with a significant genetic component that is shared across different ethnic groups. The identification of novel SNPs associated with T2D in this study may provide insights into the pathogenesis of the disease and lead to the development of new therapeutic targets.
We describe how the budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans responds to nutrient deprivation. When the cells are grown in a medium lacking uracil, they quickly become resistant to the antifungal drug fluconazole. This resistance is caused by the activation of the Aurora kinase Ipl1, which is required for kinetochore clustering and correct chromosome segregation. In the absence of Ipl1, the cells are unable to grow and divide. We show that the Ipl1 kinase is also required for nuclear migration and the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity during the non-dividing phase of the cell cycle. Our results indicate that the Aurora kinase Ipl1 plays a central role in the budding yeast response to nutrient deprivation and antifungal drug resistance.
This paper describes a case of a patient with a MTC harboring a somatic RET c.1850C>T (p. Cys630Arg) mutation. The authors review the relevant literature on the role of RET in MTC and discuss the potential significance of the identified mutation. They also describe the experimental methods used to analyze the impact of the mutation on RET expression and activity, including minigene assays and immunoprecipitation. The authors conclude that the identified mutation leads to increased RET expression and constitutive activation of downstream signaling pathways, which could contribute to the aggressiveness of the MTC.
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for detecting pathogens in humans. However, the quality of reference genomes used to identify pathogens is important for accurate diagnosis. Researchers have developed a new bioinformatics system for removing contamination from draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. They applied the system to a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes, removing contamination and low-complexity sequences to produce a cleaner database. The database provides better sensitivity and accuracy for identifying eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples compared to using the original genomes. This work has important implications for using NGS in pathogen detection and diagnosis.
Sleeping sickness, also known as human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), is a parasitic disease caused by the unicellular protozoan Trypanosoma brucei. It is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and is transmitted by the tsetse fly. HAT is characterized by two forms: acute and chronic. Acute HAT is caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, while chronic HAT is caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and is characterized by a slow onset of symptoms that can progress to severe neurological damage. The origin of T. brucei rhodesiense is unknown, but it is thought to have originated in eastern Africa and has spread westward over the past century. The disease has been spreading in Uganda, particularly in central regions, and has been reported in new areas previously unaffected by the disease. The genetic structure of T. brucei rhodesiense in Uganda has not been well-studied, but recent work suggests that there may be genetic exchange between different subpopulations of the parasite. The study of the genetic structure of T. brucei rhodesiense in Uganda is important for understanding the origin and spread of the disease, as well as for informing control strategies.
The study shows that mice lacking the protein TXNIP are more susceptible to sepsis caused by LPS. The study also shows that TXNIP is involved in the regulation of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and NO production.
The article is about the protein ZTF-8, which is conserved from worms to humans and plays a role in repairing DNA damage caused by double-strand breaks (DSBs) and meiotic (reproductive) DSBs in the germline of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The article also explains how ZTF-8 functions in promoting repair at stalled replication forks and meiotic DSBs by transducing DNA damage checkpoint signaling via the 9-1-1 pathway.
Here is a lay summary of the provided content:
The present study shows that cross-reactive T cell responses can play an important role in protecting humans against emerging influenza viruses. The authors used a translational model of immunity to influenza, using rhesus macaques (a primate species closely related to humans) and showed that T cells "primed" by infection with seasonal human influenza viruses can enable rapid virus clearance after challenge with a heterologous 2009 pandemic influenza virus. The study provides important evidence to support the development of T cell-based vaccines for influenza.
This study developed a new way to diagnose Q fever, a bacterial disease that can affect humans and animals. The new method is called "Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification" or "LAMP" for short. The researchers used a special set of primers to identify a specific gene in the bacteria, which helped them quickly and accurately identify the presence of C. burnetii, the bacteria that causes Q fever. The researchers tested the new method on human and animal samples and compared it to another method called "real-time PCR." The results showed that the new method was more sensitive and specific than the other method. This new method has the potential to be used in the field to quickly diagnose Q fever in humans and animals.
The study explored the regulatory epigenetic mutations that control the gene expression programs of embryonic stem cells (ES) in hematopoietic cell lineages. The study identified a novel class of regulatory enhancers, designated ESSEs, that are specific to the hematopoietic cell lineage. They found that hematopoietic ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes, which are indicative of their chromatin activity states. Furthermore, the study found that ESSE methylation is associated with gene transcriptional activity in cancer. The findings suggest that ESSEs provide a framework for reactivation of ES genes in cancer.
The study investigated the effect of population subdivision on the time it takes to cross a fitness valley or plateau. The results showed that subdivision can significantly accelerate crossing in a wide range of parameters. The effect is most pronounced when the process is driven by the deme that crosses fastest, and when the population is in the sequential fixation regime. The study used a simple and minimal model that includes only population subdivision into demes connected by migration, and does not require significant size changes of the demes or environmental heterogeneity. The study found that the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing that can be gained by subdivision occurs when migration is faster than mutation and deleterious mutations fix with low probability. The study also found that subdivision with migration alone can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus, and shed light onto the quantitative conditions necessary for this to occur.
This study describes the first comprehensive metabolomics analysis of the midguts of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes exposed to dengue virus. The authors used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze the metabolite profiles of infected and uninfected midguts at different time points post-infection. They identified significant changes in several molecules involved in lipid metabolism, energy storage, and biosynthesis pathways. These findings may provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying dengue virus infection and replication in mosquitoes.
In this study, the authors developed a simple and parsimonious rabbit action potential (AP) model that integrates a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of the rapid sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological model of repolarization. The PR model was calibrated using experimental data from the rabbit ventricular AP under physiological conditions, and was able to reproduce several important electrophysiological phenomena, including cellular alternans at rates greater than 250 beats per minute, reentrant spiral waves as observed on the surface of the rabbit heart, and spiral wave breakup. The authors also explored the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral wave breakup, and found that the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of the outward potassium current (IK1) were the primary determinants of these phenomena. Overall, the PR model provides a simple and biologically meaningful framework for studying the electrophysiology of the rabbit heart, and has the potential to be extended to represent more complex cardiac phenomena.
In the ciliate Paramecium, the somatic genome is assembled from tens of thousands of non-coding sequences that are flanked by two TA dinucleotides. These sequences are known as Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs) and are excised from the genome during sexual processes. It is thought that the excision of IESs is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) that are introduced at both ends of each IES. A study has now identified two DNA ligase genes (LIG4 and XRCC4) that are essential for the repair of IES excision sites. These genes are required for both the precise assembly of chromosome and circle junctions. It is proposed that IES excision is initiated by two DSBs introduced at both ends of each IES, followed by Ligase IV/Xrcc4p-dependent repair.
Chagas disease is a type of heart disease caused by a parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi. It is estimated to affect 9 million people worldwide. Sudden death is considered the main cause of death in patients with Chagas disease. However, this information comes from a time before drugs were available that changed the natural history of heart failure. A new study looked at the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas disease compared to heart failure caused by other conditions. The study found that sudden death was not the most common cause of death in patients with Chagas disease. Instead, progressive heart failure was the most common cause of death. The study also found that certain factors, such as left ventricular end diastolic diameter and use of amiodarone, were associated with heart failure mortality. This information could help with the selection of treatment choices for patients with Chagas disease.
This is a scientific article about a study of a plant defense protein called rpL10A. The authors found that rpL10A is a specific partner of a protein called NIK1, which is involved in defense against viruses. They used a number of different techniques to investigate the relationship between rpL10A and NIK1, including genetic analysis, biochemical assays, and confocal microscopy. They found that rpL10A is required for NIK1 to function properly in defense against viruses. The study provides important new information about the mechanisms of plant defense against viruses.
We have previously shown that the thermal dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis has an alternative oxidase (AOX) that protects the fungal cell from oxidative stress. In this study, we used an antisense RNA strategy to show that the expression of this enzyme is required for the survival of P. brasiliensis cells inside IFN-γg-activated alveolar macrophages. We also demonstrated that the viability of P. brasiliensis cells was reduced after exposure to H2O2, suggesting a relationship between the expression of AOX and the survival of P. brasiliensis cells under oxidative stress.
The brain stores memories in various ways. Researchers have found that in the hippocampus, memories can be stored in place cells as "attractor networks" that are made up of a group of neurons that fire together and keep their activity stable. These networks can change quickly and abruptly between different environments. However, a recent study found that in some cases, place cell activity in the hippocampus can also change gradually as the environment changes. This could mean that memories are not stored in simple attractor networks, but rather in more complex networks that can change in more nuanced ways. Researchers used a computer model to explore this idea and found that the gradual transitions they saw in the place cell activity could be explained by a model in which the place cells were connected to each other in a way that allowed them to change smoothly as the environment changed. This could suggest that memories are stored in a more complex way in the brain than is currently understood, and that place cells in the hippocampus may be more important for storing contextual information than previously thought.
Entamoeba histolytica is a parasitic protozoan that causes dysentery and extraintestinal infections. Infection occurs when trophozoites invade host cells and undergo asexual division, leading to the formation of cysts. To survive in the host cell, E. histolytica is exposed to reactive oxygen species, which can cause oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. To protect themselves from oxidative damage, E. histolytica lacks several components of the usual antioxidant defense mechanisms, such as catalase, reduced glutathione, and the glutathione-recycling enzymes. Despite this, E. histolytica possesses several enzymes and proteins that are thought to be involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species, including peroxiredoxin, superoxide dismutase, rubrerythrin, and the flavo-di-iron protein. In this study, the authors used capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) to investigate the metabolic changes that occur in response to oxidative stress. By comparing the metabolic profiles of E. histolytica trophozoites subjected to oxidative stress with those of unstressed trophozoites, the authors were able to identify several metabolic changes that may be associated with the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. These changes included an increase in the levels of chitin synthesis intermediates, a decrease in the levels of several amino acids, and an increase in the levels of several nitrogen-containing compounds. The authors also found that E. histolytica trophozoites subjected to oxidative stress had increased levels of several enzymes involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen species, including peroxiredoxin, superoxide dismutase, and rubrerythrin. These findings suggest that E. histolytica may have evolved unique mechanisms for detoxifying reactive oxygen species, which could be targeted for the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of E. histolytica infections.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of a protein called IKAROS in hematopoiesis, or blood cell production. They found that IKAROS works with a complex called NuRD to promote transcription, or the process of making copies of DNA into RNA. IKAROS helps recruit NuRD to specific genes that need to be transcribed, and also works with another complex called P-TEFb to facilitate transcription elongation. The authors found that the expression level of IKAROS affects how much NuRD and P-TEFb are recruited to specific genes. They also found that a mutant version of IKAROS that cannot bind to PP1α, an important protein for P-TEFb activation, cannot sustain gene expression or promote normal hematopoiesis. Overall, the authors' findings suggest that IKAROS is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its dynamic expression pattern is required for proper hematopoiesis.
In this paper, the authors analyzed RABV sequences from Trinidad to understand the origins of the virus and to see if there are any outbreaks due to in situ evolution or importation of virus from the South American mainland. They found that there were two major lineages of RABV in Trinidad, and that the Trinidadian RABV sequences fell into two groups that were closely related to RABV from other countries in South and Central America. They also found that there were likely co-circulations of different lineages of RABV in Trinidad during 2000, which raises questions about the transmission dynamics of RABV in Trinidad. Overall, the authors suggest that further studies should be conducted to investigate the relationship between RABV spatiotemporal dynamics and vampire bat population ecology, with a particular focus on any movement between the mainland and Trinidad.
We created a Boolean model of the cortical arealisation gene network and identified which interactions are necessary for the network to perform reliably. We found that the network must include repressive interactions between Emx2 and Pax6, and between Sp8 and Fgf8, and must lack inductive interactions between Fgf8 and Emx2 and between Fgf8 and Pax6. We also found that the network must contain the interaction Fgf8→Emx2, but not Emx2→Fgf8. The results of this analysis may be used to inform future experimental investigations into the arealisation gene network.
The current study presents genome-wide analysis of H2A ubiquitination (uH2A) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The authors use ChIP-Seq technology to determine the distribution of uH2A in MEFs, and find that it is enriched at the promoters of well-annotated genes. They then investigate the relationship between uH2A and the H3K27me3 mark, and find that a peak of uH2A just inside the transcription start site (TSS) of these genes. The authors also compare the distribution of uH2A in Bmi1 null and wild-type MEFs, and find that Bmi1-dependent uH2A is enriched at promoters containing the H3K27me3 mark. They then investigate the expression of genes containing Bmi1-dependent uH2A peaks, and find that they are expressed lower than genes without uH2A peaks. Finally, the authors show that genes with Bmi1-dependent uH2A peaks are expressed higher upon Bmi1 knockout than genes without uH2A peaks. Overall, this study provides important insights into the function of H2A ubiquitination in mammalian development and differentiation.
Our study is the first to describe the role of a non-coding RNA, mPINC, in pregnancy. We found that mPINC is expressed abundantly in mammary glands throughout pregnancy, with expression increasing dramatically between 12 and 18 days after parturition in mice. We also discovered that mPINC interacts with the PRC2 complex and the RbAp46 subunit of the PRC1 complex to regulate gene expression in the mammary gland.
PML, a protein expressed in the nucleus that inhibits HIV replication, is found in the cytoplasm of infected cells in a novel, broadly antiviral function.
The article provides a detailed description of the Matt algorithm, a new method for aligning multiple protein structures. The algorithm is based on a dynamic programming approach and uses geometric information to improve the alignment. The Matt algorithm is compared to other structure alignment algorithms, such as POSA and FlexProt, in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The article also discusses how to use Matt to evaluate the alignability of two structures based on their structural similarity and the p-value score.
We have generated a new tool to study the mechanism of mitotic exit in Xenopus egg extracts. We have found that Gwl, a member of the WD40 repeat protein family, is phosphorylated by Cdk1 during mitosis and this phosphorylation is required for mitotic exit. We have also found that the phosphorylation of Gwl is regulated by the kinase inhibitor okadaic acid. These findings suggest that Gwl may be an important regulator of mitotic exit.
Here is the lay summary of the provided content: Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are critical to controlling viral infections. The development of an effective AIDS vaccine will require the induction of NAbs against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS. HIV Envelope (Env) protein is the primary target of NAbs, and understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the NAbs induced by natural infection is critical to developing an effective vaccine. We examined NAb responses in two subtype C HIV-infected individuals with acute subtype C viral infection. We found that NAb responses induced by acute infection were diverse and included autologous NAbs targeting the V1V2 and V3V5 domains of the envelope. We also observed that NAb responses developed with high neutralization activity against autologous viruses, and the NAb responses were diverse. We also found that the NAb responses against autologous viruses were differentially dependent on V1V2 and V3V5 domains. In addition, we found that NAb responses against autologous viruses were maintained despite high levels of viremia and viral diversification during chronic infection. These results provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of NAb responses induced by natural infection, which can inform vaccine development efforts.
The authors of this study used 13 outbred individuals from a species of Brassicaceae family, Capsella grandiflora, to investigate the amount of positive and negative selection in coding and non-coding regions across the genome. They used whole-genome sequencing and expression data to estimate the strength of negative selection in coding and non-coding regions, and to compare the strength of positive selection between high and low expression genes. Their results suggest that both positive and negative selection are pervasive in coding regions, 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, and constrained non-coding regions, but that a large proportion of non-coding DNA may evolve neutrally. Additionally, they found that differences in negative selection drive differences in rates of molecular evolution, with stronger negative selection in high expression genes. These results provide insight into the evolutionary processes of selection and neutral drift that shape the diversity of non-coding regions in plant genomes.
EBNA2 is a non-DNA binding viral transcription factor that cooperates with EBF1 and RBP-jκ to regulate B-cell specific gene expression. The authors use ChIP-seq and other genomic analysis techniques to identify EBF1 and RBP-jκ binding sites in LCLs and Mutu I cells, and to determine how EBNA2 alters these binding sites. They also use gene set enrichment analysis to determine how changes in EBF1 and RBP-jκ binding sites affect B-cell gene expression. Their findings suggest that EBNA2 alters the selectivity of EBF1 and RBP-jκ binding sites in LCLs, leading to changes in B-cell gene expression.
In this study, researchers looked at the genetic structure and vector competence of the mosquito Aedes aegypti in different parts of Mexico. They found that the populations of mosquitoes north and south of the Neovolcanic axis (NVA) were genetically distinct and had different levels of vector competence. They also found that barriers to gene flow in vector populations may affect the frequency of genes that control vector competence. The study highlights the importance of understanding how genetic differences in mosquito populations can affect their ability to transmit dengue viruses and how these differences can be influenced by environmental factors.
The study investigated the role of the bacterial replication control protein, DnaA, in initiating DNA replication. The study used flow cytometry to measure the timing of DNA replication in strains of Escherichia coli that had different levels of DnaA. The results showed that a two-fold increase in the level of DnaA did not affect the timing of DNA replication. The study also investigated the role of the datA-dependent inactivation of DnaA (DDAH) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA in replication control. The study found that loss of datA affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein. The study suggests that compromised cell cycle machines perform in a less robust manner. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of replication control proteins in the timing of DNA replication.
The article introduces a new method called partial Granger causality to analyze the interactions between multiple variables. This method is able to identify causal relationships in multivariate data with exogenous inputs and latent variables in the frequency domain. The authors test their method extensively with toy models and successfully apply it to experimental datasets, including gene microarray data of HeLa cell cycle, in vivo multi-electrode array local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from the inferotemporal cortex of a sheep, and in vivo LFPs recorded from distributed sites in the right hemisphere of a macaque monkey. The authors demonstrate that partial Granger causality is able to reveal the right causal relationship whereas other methods such as partial directed coherence fail. The authors also note that their method has a transparent statistical meaning and can be extended to the frequency domain.
The study presented a new method, called Lanc-CSV, for inferring local ancestry in admixed populations. The method uses informative continent-specific variants (CSVs) identified in reference panels of individuals from multiple continental groups and combined with read data from admixed individuals to infer their ancestry. The method is based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) that describes the local ancestry of an admixed individual as a series of transitions between different ancestry states. The transition probabilities between states are modeled as a function of the genetic distance between informative CSVs and the recombination rate between them. The method was compared to three other widely used methods for local ancestry inference, RFMix, LAMP-LD, and MULTIMIX, and was shown to be more accurate in simulated data and in real data from the 1000 Genomes Project.
The circadian rhythm is a daily rhythm in living organisms, controlled by a biological clock. Researchers have found that 10%-15% of all genes in mammals oscillate in a daily rhythm, and these rhythms are controlled by an intrinsic molecular clock. However, statistical analyses of these rhythms are limited by the small size of datasets and high levels of stochastic noise. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a new approach that uses digital signal processing algorithms to identify circadian baseline oscillation in almost 100% of all expressed genes. They preprocess the gene expression profiles by z-score transformation, assign each gene a phase based on the maximal correlation to an ideal cosine curve, and analyze the periodogram of each phase fraction separately. They then use low-pass frequency filters and polynomial smoothing to detect the point at which the circadian signal deteriorates below recognition at the p = 0.05 significance cutoff. The authors estimate the total number of circadian oscillating genes by summing the results from each phase group. They suggest that the number of periodically expressed genes revealed by this method may be different from the traditional approach, but it provides a reasonable compromise between power and specificity.
Birds are known for their high rates of genetic recombination. In this study, we re-sequenced a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers to study recombination at high resolution. We found that recombination events are concentrated in specific genomic regions and that these regions coincide with gene promoters and CpG islands. We also found that the male recombination rate is higher than the female recombination rate and that CO interference is present in this species. These results contribute to our understanding of how recombination is regulated in birds and its consequences on the genome.
We propose a coarse-grained model for repeat-protein folding that takes into account the topology of the repeating array and the physical interactions between the repeats. This model is based on the physics of the Ising model, which is a simple model for magnetic systems. We find that the parameters of the Ising model are related to the topology of the repeating array and the interactions between the repeats. We also find that the model can explain the folding properties of repeat-proteins, including stability, cooperativity, and the existence of partially folded intermediates. These properties can be related to the topology of the repeating array and the interactions between the repeats.
This article is about the role of the integrated stress response (ISR) in liver cancer. The ISR is a response to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is involved in many different functions in the body. ER stress is caused by conditions that lead to liver cancer, such as obesity, alcoholism, and viral hepatitis. The ISR has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of many different types of cancer, but it is not known whether it plays a role in liver cancer. This article describes how the ISR is involved in liver cancer by showing that a protein called CHOP, which is regulated by the ISR, is upregulated in liver tumors in humans and mice. CHOP is important for the development of liver cancer because it promotes inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. The article also describes how deletion of CHOP reduces the levels of basal inflammatory signaling in the liver, which supports the idea that CHOP is involved in liver cancer. The article concludes by saying that CHOP is a common contributing factor in the development of liver cancer from a variety of chronic liver diseases.
Leishmaniasis is a skin disease caused by parasites transmitted through sandfly bites. In Ethiopia, the most common form of leishmaniasis is cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to L. aethiopica. This CL can be difficult to treat, especially when it affects the mucous membranes (mucocutaneous leishmaniasis) or when it spreads throughout the body (diffuse CL). Treatment options for CL due to L. aethiopica are limited, and there is a need for new and more effective treatments.
A biochemical oscillator has been reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. The oscillator consists of three proteins (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC), which interact to form complexes that oscillate in composition over time. The composition of the complexes has been analyzed by negative-stain electron microscopy and blue-native/SDS-PAGE. A model has been developed that accurately predicts the rhythm of the KaiABC complexes and describes the dynamics of monomer exchange among KaiC hexamers. The in vitro oscillator exhibits temperature-compensated oscillations and can be reset by temperature pulses.
Our study shows that a closer-to-the-mean brain activity level before a sensory cue predicts faster reaction times and higher hit rates in a visual detection task. We examined the relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance in human electrocorticography (ECoG) data from patients with epilepsy. We found evidence for an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial ECoG activity and behavioral performance: trials with a brain activity level closer to the across-trial mean were associated with faster reaction times and higher hit rates. The presence of an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance suggests that deterministic and stochastic factors both contribute to brain variability, and that these two sources of variability may have opposite effects on behavioral performance.
Trichosporonales are an understudied group of fungi with important biotechnological properties. We studied the organization of mating type loci (MAT) in 24 Trichosporonales genomes, and found that all species carry physically linked MAT loci. The MAT loci have two alleles, each containing a HD gene and a P/R gene, and are highly conserved in gene content and order within the group. Interestingly, Trichosporonales do not carry two unlinked MAT loci like their sister group Tremellales, which includes the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. The Trichosporonales MAT loci also do not carry two HD genes like the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. The analysis of 24 Trichosporonales genomes suggests that the fusion of the HD and P/R loci as well as the loss of one HD gene per allele occurred independently in the Trichosporonales and the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. This provides further evidence that convergent evolution leading to physically linked MAT loci is evolutionary beneficial under certain circumstances and has been selected for multiple times in basidiomycetes. However, in contrast to other basidiomycetes, such as the pathogenic Cryptococcus species and several Microbotryum species [8 , 38] , the fused MAT loci of the Trichosporonales have a highly conserved gene content and gene order , suggesting unique mechanisms underlying the evolution of fused MAT loci in these groups.
Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted to humans primarily by triatomine vectors. Due to its importance in public health, vector control strategies have been widely implemented through several regional initiatives in the Americas. These interventions are based on the elimination of domiciliated triatomine vectors by residual insecticide spraying and/or housing improvement. However, it has become increasingly clear that several triatomine species do not establish permanent domestic colonies but can occasionally infest domestic habitats by immigration from peridomestic and/or sylvatic habitats. These non-domiciliated species include Rhodnius prolixus in Venezuela, Triatoma brasiliensis and Triatoma pseudomaculata in Brazil, Triatoma mexicana in central Mexico, and Triatoma dimidiata in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico and Belize. Mathematical modelling has revealed that dispersal is the dominant parameter involved in this infestation process. Alternative strategies for the control of non-domiciliated vectors include insect screens and bednets, which are effective when applied consistently. Control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying, because it would require yearly application and an accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.

The 2013–15 Ebola outbreak was unprecedented because of its sustained transmission within urban environments and the thousands of survivors. At the time, the World Health Organization did not have enough evidence to provide guidance on which body fluids were infectious and when they posed a risk to humans. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of published evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors. We found 33 studies that were eligible, but for most body fluids, there were insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions. Furthermore, the prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken more than 16 days after onset were usually negative. Filovirus was reported in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every otherwise confirmed patient. The infectious risk of many body fluids, particularly semen, during or after illness is unclear. However, contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission.
In this study, the authors developed and analyzed a mathematical model of a neuron that incorporates the idea of non-Markovian processes. In the classical model of a neuron, the voltage is determined by the previous voltage step. However, in real neurons, the voltage follows multiple timescale dynamics that arise from multiple active membrane conductances. This results in power-law behavior in which the membrane voltage cannot be characterized with a single time constant. The authors used a fractional derivative to model this process. The fractional derivative is a non-local process in which the value of the variable is determined by integrating a temporal weighted voltage trace, also called the memory trace. The authors showed that their model can reproduce upward and downward spike adaptations found in experiments, and also produce spikes with longer first-spike latency and high inter-spike variability with power-law distribution. They also analyzed spike adaptation and the responses to noisy and oscillatory input. The authors' model deviates from the classical model and reflects the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation.
This study presents the first characterization of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene family in Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, an emerging human pathogen. The authors identified six SOD isoforms (PbSOD1 to PbSOD6) in the P. brasiliensis genome. PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are chloroplast localized and PbSOD2, PbSOD4, PbSOD5, and PbSOD6 are cytoplasmic isoforms. They found that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are required for growth and survival in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that they play a role in the defense against oxidative stress. The authors also demonstrated that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are localized to chloroplasts in yeast cells, whereas in mycelial cells they are localized to the cytoplasm. Finally, the authors found that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 knockdown strains are highly sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, suggesting that these isoforms are important for the defense against oxidative stress in P. brasiliensis.
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are proteins that do not have a fixed 3D structure, but can fold into different shapes depending on their environment. These proteins are very sensitive to proteolysis, which is the breakdown of proteins by enzymes. However, in vivo, or inside a living organism, IDPs are not degraded any more quickly than other types of proteins. This can be explained because IDPs are thought to interact with chaperones in the cell, which helps to protect them from degradation. To test this theory, the authors took data from studies that measured interactions between proteins and used it to analyze how predicted disorder correlates with chaperone binding. Their main finding was that predicted disorder actually shows a negative correlation with chaperone binding in bacteria, yeast, and metazoa (animals). In other words, proteins that are more likely to be disordered are less likely to bind chaperones. The authors suggest that this could be because the primary reason for chaperone binding is not to help proteins fold, but to promote assembly with other proteins.
In this study, the authors aim to identify Salm and Salr target genes in the Drosophila wing disc. They used microarray experiments to compare the expression profiles of wing discs with and without Salm and Salr knockdown. They then analyzed the expression pattern of the genes whose mRNA levels varied significantly using in situ hybridization. They found a complex transcription landscape regulated by Spalt proteins in the wing disc, with candidates for both positive and negative regulation of Salm and Salr target genes. They also performed phenotypic analysis of these genes and found that a fraction of them are required for wing growth and patterning. The identification of these target genes opens a new avenue to reconstruct the genetic structure of the wing and understand the role of Salm and Salr in wing development.
In people, having too many or too few centrioles can lead to various problems, such as cancer or birth defects. To understand how to control the number of centrioles, scientists have studied a protein called ZYG-1 in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. They discovered that two other proteins, PP1 and I-2, regulate the level of ZYG-1. When the level of ZYG-1 is reduced, the number of centrioles decreases. When the level of ZYG-1 is increased, the number of centrioles also increases. This suggests that PP1 and I-2 help to keep the number of centrioles within a healthy range.
The article provides a description of a study conducted to investigate the occurrence and possible transmission cycles of Leishmaniasis in Campinas, Brazil. Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania, which are transmitted by sand flies. The study was conducted in an environmentally protected area (EPA) located in Campinas, which contains Atlantic Forest remnants and has experienced significant environmental changes in recent decades, including deforestation and construction of upscale residential condominiums. The study involved trapping of sand flies and capturing of free-living wild animals in different locations within the EPA, as well as a serological survey of canine dogs living in the condominiums where the Leishmaniasis focus was located. The results of the study suggest that multiple components may be involved in the transmission cycle of Leishmaniasis in the study area, including canines, dogs, and sand flies. The study highlights the importance of understanding the transmission cycles of Leishmaniasis in order to develop effective control strategies for the disease.
EBV-encoded miRNAs are important for EBV-associated carcinogenesis. We found that miR-BART9, a common miRNA in EBV-positive NPC, was upregulated in NPC cells and tissues. Elevated miR-BART9 expression enhanced the migration and invasion of NPC cells in vitro and promoted the metastasis of NPC in vivo. Furthermore, we found that miR-BART9 directly targeted E-cadherin to promote the mesenchymal phenotype in NPC cells.
We present a command-line tool called ggsashimi for visualizing splicing events across multiple RNA-seq samples. Unlike other tools, ggsashimi creates aggregated plots for groups of experiments, and can handle large genomic regions by scaling down the segments between splice sites.

This study proposes a statistical model of evolution for cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that takes into account the dynamics of TFBS switching and indel events, and applies the model to two genome-wide datasets of TF binding in Drosophila blastoderm. The model is designed to be biologically realistic and captures the important evolutionary processes that are relevant to CRM evolution. The study finds that functional TFBSs are under strong evolutionary constraints even if their neighboring genes are not expressed in the blastoderm. The authors also find that binding sites in distal bound sequences (relative to transcription start sites) tend to be more conserved than those in proximal regions. They implemented their model as an efficient software program called EMMA (Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module Analysis), which is freely available to the research community. The study shows that EMMA can accurately align orthologous CRMs and predict the targets of specific transcription factors. The results of this study have important implications for understanding the regulation of early development in Drosophila and other organisms.
The piRNA pathway is required for normal oogenesis and early embryogenesis in Drosophila. We found that the piRNA pathway has two distinct functions during these stages of development. One function is to direct the telomere protection complex to transposon-derived RNAs and to prevent chromosome fusions. This function is mediated by a subpopulation of short piRNAs that bind to Piwi, a protein required for telomere protection. The other function is to transcriptionally silence transposons. We used bioinformatic analysis to identify a cluster of piRNA-encoding transposons that are highly expressed during oogenesis and are likely to be targets for the piRNA pathway. We found that mutations in aub and armi, two essential piRNA pathway genes, do not affect the expression of this cluster, whereas ago3 and rhi mutations, which are weak hypomorphs, significantly reduce its expression. We therefore conclude that armi and aub have a novel function in telomere protection that is independent of transcriptional silencing.
In November 2007, an outbreak of a previously unknown type of Ebola virus occurred in the Bundibugyo district of Uganda. This new virus, now known as Bundibugya ebolavirus, caused 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths. The virus genome was rapidly sequenced using a metagenomics pyro-sequencing method and a traditional primer walking approach. The sequencing revealed that the virus was distinct from the four known species of Ebola virus, although it was distantly related to Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus. A real-time RT-PCR assay specific for the NP gene of this virus was quickly developed and evaluated, showing excellent sensitivity. The assay was transferred to the Uganda Virus Research Institute during the course of the outbreak to facilitate rapid identification and isolation of Ebola cases in the affected area for efficient control of the outbreak. The entire genome of the Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus was also rapidly sequenced using a combination of pyrosequencing and primer walking approaches. The analysis revealed that the new virus differed from the four existing Ebola virus species by approximately 32% nucleotide difference from even the closest relative, Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus. The unique nature of this virus has other implications too, including screening of potential antivirals and pathogenicity studies. Retrospective analysis of case description, epidemiologic and laboratory data from the Bundibugya outbreak are still ongoing, but it is clear that the case fatality associated with Bundibugya ebolavirus infection is lower than that observed for Zaire ebolavirus infection. Studies in non-human primates need to be performed to compare the pathogenicity of these viruses. This investigation also highlights the power of molecular detection and characterization tools to quickly identify new pathogens, while providing a cautionary note regarding sole dependence on molecular techniques such as real-time PCR assays for detection of novel agents in biodefense or emerging disease surveillance programs.
The study looks at the progression rates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by analyzing the duration of each stage of the disease as described by the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Functional Assessment Staging procedure (FAST). The study found that the standard deviations of stage durations are comparable to their mean values for stages 4–6, indicating a high amount of heterogeneity in the progression of AD. The study suggests that this heterogeneity is likely due to the presence of subgroups of patients with different patterns of decline.
The adult hippocampus is made up of two different types of neurons, one of which is produced through a process called neurogenesis. In the past, studies of adult neurogenesis have been done on either the hippocampal network as a whole or in isolation from other regions of the brain. However, the hippocampus receives input from other regions of the brain, and in the new study, the researchers have introduced a spatial dimension to the network model. They have used grid cells, which are neurons found in the entorhinal cortex that fire in response to specific locations in space, to create a more realistic input pattern for the network. The researchers have then used three different adaptation strategies to test the performance of the network with this new type of input pattern. They found that the strategy that incorporated both additive neurogenesis and neuronal death outperformed the other two strategies, and that the performance of the network was most dependent on the timing of neuronal death. Overall, the study provides evidence for the importance of neurogenesis in the hippocampus and the ways in which it interacts with other regions of the brain.
This paper reports the discovery of a previously unknown role for peroxidases in the maintenance of lysosomal function in trypanosomes. The authors demonstrate that in the absence of peroxidase activity, trypanosomes undergo lysosomal disintegration, followed by damage of the mitochondria and other cellular membranes, and total cell lysis. The process is linked to the endocytosis of iron ions, which are required for DNA synthesis, antioxidant defense, mitochondrial FeS cluster biosynthesis, and, depending on the developmental stage, for mitochondrial respiration and alternative oxidase. The discovery of this unprecedented biological role of peroxidases is expected to have strong impact on respective studies in other human pathogens as well as the mammalian host.
Pmel is an albino mouse that carries a single-nucleotide mutation in the Pmel gene, leading to the production of a truncated Pmel protein. The Pmel−/− mice have a normal coat color and do not exhibit albinism. They are viable and fertile, and the absence of albinism suggests that the mutation is not a loss-of-function mutation. The Pmel−/− mice have a hair coat color that is intermediate between black and red, which is likely due to the production of pheomelanin. The Pmel−/− mice have normal ear pigmentation and normal hearing, suggesting that the Pmel gene does not play a significant role in these tissues. The Pmel−/− mice also do not exhibit a hair follicle cycling defect or increased susceptibility to skin cancer. The Pmel−/− mice are useful for studying the function of Pmel in other tissues, such as the eyes, without the confounding effects of albinism.
The study aims to determine the effectiveness of environmental interventions for dengue vector control. Environmental interventions are sustainable and safe methods that do not pose risks of environmental contamination or toxicity. The study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 studies, which involved 16 studies contributing data to the meta-analysis. Three environmental methods were evaluated: container covers with and without insecticides, waste management, and elimination of breeding sites. The study found that each of the investigated environmental methods had some effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, the overall role in the reduction of dengue transmission of vector control remains unclear due to issues with study design.
This study describes the identification of stalled translation sites in response to the small molecule PF8503 in human cells. The authors used high-throughput ribosome profiling to identify ribosome stalled translation sites in cells treated with PF8503. They found that PF8503 stalls translation at sites that were also stalled by a protein translation inhibitor called HHT. The authors also show that these stalled translation sites are enriched for mutations in genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and ribosome function. The study provides insights into the mechanism of action of PF8503 and could lead to the development of new treatments for ribosomal diseases.
Our research team has recently discovered that the viral protein SOX, produced by the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), plays a key role in the destruction of cellular RNA. This protein stimulates the polyadenylation of certain cellular transcripts, leading to their degradation. We have found that this process occurs in a manner dependent on SOX's ability to bind to RNA. Our work is important because it uncovers a novel mechanism by which KSHV, a human cancer-associated virus, may contribute to the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma. It also reveals a new role for the polyadenylation pathway in RNA turnover, a process that is important for maintaining cellular gene expression.
The type III interferon receptor ( IL-28R ) is important for host defense against some viral pathogens, but its role in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens is unknown. In this study, the researchers infected mice with S . aureus or P . aeruginosa and found that IFNλ was induced. This resulted in downregulation of the microRNA miR-21 , sustained expression of PDCD4 , and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines. They also found that mice lacking the IFNλ receptor or PDCD4 had significantly improved clearance of the bacteria and less pulmonary pathology.
This study assesses the factors that contribute to death in patients with late-stage sleeping sickness (HAT). The study included 781 patients with confirmed HAT cases and complete medical records. The main outcome measure was death, which occurred in 17.2% of the standard melarsoprol schedule, 12.1% of the short melarsoprol schedule, 5.4% of the first-line eflornithine regimen, 9.1% of the NECT regimen, and 36% of the selective eflornithine regimen. After adjusting for treatment, the most significant predictors of death were clinical dysfunction on admission (odds ratio: 10.40, 95% CI: 6.55–16.51), high protidorachy (odds ratio: 2.14, 95% CI: 1.35–3.39), presence of parasites in the cerebrospinal fluid (odds ratio: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.03–2.81), and high cytorachy (odds ratio: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.18–3.37). A multivariable analysis within treatment groups retained clinical dysfunction on admission (in ARS 9, ARS 10, and DFMO B groups) and high protidorachy (in ARS 10 and DFMO B groups) as significant predictors of death. The study recommends that clinical dysfunction on admission and high protidorachy should be included in the present case definition and used as a basis for standardized clinical records.
The paper presents a method to track and analyze the social behavior of flies in a large group. The method uses a graph-based approach to identify individual flies in a crowded scene and tracks their movements over time. It also includes a machine learning algorithm to detect touch interactions between flies. The method is validated using expert annotations and applied to analyze the effects of isolation on social behavior and metabolism in flies.
This is a pilot study that aimed to improve clinical care for patients with diarrheal diseases in Bangladesh by using a smartphone-based tool. The tool was adapted from WHO diarrheal disease management guidelines and included a function to estimate a patient's weight, which is important for treating these diseases. The tool was evaluated at two remote hospitals in Bangladesh, and the study found that the tool improved the adherence to guidelines for the treatment of patients with diarrheal diseases. The study also found that the tool improved the accuracy of weight estimates, especially for younger children. The study suggests that smartphone-based decision-support tools can improve the quality of care for patients with diarrheal diseases, and it could be expanded to include more diseases and hospitals in the future.
This study examines the effects of temperature changes on the survival and reproduction of a host species ( Daphnia magna) and its parasite ( Ordospora colligata). The study used experimental data to build a mathematical model of the within-host parasite population dynamics and host survival. The model incorporated parameters such as host and parasite reproduction, host and parasite mortality, and parasite growth, which were assumed to have temperature dependencies. The study found that parasite growth, host reproduction, and host mortality were all negatively affected by high temperatures. The model also showed that the cost of infection (i.e. the percent reduction in mean lifespan due to infection) increased with temperature, suggesting that climate change could have significant negative effects on host–parasite interactions.
In this study, we propose a microcircuit of four types of interneurons (parvalbumin-positive, somatostatin-positive, and vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive) and excitatory pyramidal cells that provide a biophysical mechanism for the modulation of somatic and dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells. We show that the mutual inhibition between somatostatin-positive and vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive neurons can lead to an amplification of weak signals arriving at somatostatin-positive neurons. This amplification can transform weak signals into strong responses and can switch the microcircuit between two distinct processing modes.
Microbiota plays an important role in various aspects of human health, including disease. To link specific microbes to specific phenotypes, researchers use a statistical technique called microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS) that compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples. However, these studies can produce spurious associations that do not provide any mechanistic insight due to microbial interactions. In this study, the authors developed a method called Direct Association Analysis (DAA) that removes indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DAA showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to IBD and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in the inflammatory bowel disease.
In this study, the authors compared the effect of Wolbachia on the replication and transmission of two flaviviruses, DENV and WNV, using two different infection models: transient infection and stable transinfection. The transient infection model involved injecting Wolbachia bacteria into the mosquitoes, while the stable transinfection model involved transinfecting mosquitoes with Wolbachia bacteria. The results showed that both infection models had a similar effect on DENV and WNV replication and transmission. Specifically, the Wolbachia bacteria had a blocking effect on both viruses, which means that they reduced the ability of the viruses to replicate and spread within the mosquito population. This study provides important evidence for the potential use of Wolbachia as a natural control method for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and West Nile virus.
This study examines the relationship between cilia, organelles that project from cells and serve a variety of functions, and the InvC, a specialized region of the cilium that is associated with signal transduction. The authors use C . elegans as a model organism to study the InvC and its relationship to other parts of the cilium. They use genetic and imaging techniques to show that the InvC is distinct from the rest of the cilium and that it is established early in development. They also show that the InvC is required for the proper placement and function of cilia. The authors use a combination of genetic and imaging techniques to investigate the relationship between the InvC and other parts of the cilium. They find that the InvC is distinct from the rest of the cilium and that it is required for the proper placement and function of cilia. The authors also use genetic and imaging techniques to investigate the relationship between the InvC and other parts of the cilium. They find that the InvC is distinct from the rest of the cilium and that it is required for the proper placement and function of cilia. Overall, this study provides important insights into the structure and function of cilia.
The myelin sheath is a multilayer of lipid-rich membrane that wraps around axons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This layer is essential for the efficient saltatory conduction of nerve impulses along axons. Myelination is a highly regulated process that involves the coordinated differentiation and maturation of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the CNS. In this study, the authors have used Scribble, a highly conserved regulator of intracellular polarity, as a model to understand the molecular mechanisms that control myelination and remyelination in the CNS. They have demonstrated that Scribble is essential for myelination and that it is expressed in oligodendrocytes throughout different stages of development and differentiation. The authors have also shown that loss of Scribble function results in impaired myelination, suggesting that Scribble is required for the establishment of intracellular polarity. Their work has important implications for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that control myelination and remyelination, and for the development of therapeutic interventions to treat demyelinating diseases of the CNS.
The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes produces a virulence factor called Sls, which is a cytotoxic and hemolytic protein that has been linked to systemic infection. To better understand the role of Sls in the virulence of L. monocytogenes, a comprehensive investigation of the Sls-related genes in this pathogen was conducted. The study revealed that the Sls-related genes form a cluster that encodes three inducible cytotoxic and hemolytic proteins, LslA, LslB, and LslC. The results of the study suggest that the Sls-related genes are part of a larger set of virulence genes that contribute to the survival of L. monocytogenes in macrophages. The study also demonstrated the utility of a luciferase-based reporter system to investigate the regulation of the Sls-related genes in L. monocytogenes.
Mycetoma is a rare disease that affects the skin and underlying tissues. It is caused by fungi or bacteria that form large structures called grains within the tissue. Researchers wanted to know more about how these grains are surrounded by immune cells and whether a specific type of immune cell, called Th17 cells, are involved in mycetoma. They studied the immune cells in the tissue surrounding grains from three different types of mycetoma: Madurella mycetomatis, Actinomyces pelletieri, and Streptomyces somaliensis. They found that in all three types of mycetoma, the cells surrounding the grains were made up of three different types of immune cells: neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells. They also found that a specific type of T cell, called Th17 cells, were more common in tissue surrounding grains from Actinomyces pelletieri and Streptomyces somaliensis than Madurella mycetomatis. They also found that the levels of Th17 cells were correlated with the severity of the disease. This study provides new information about the immune cells involved in mycetoma and could lead to new ways to treat the disease.
Intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs ) are a type of protein that do not fold into a specific structure but instead exist as a random coil. These proteins play important roles in the body, including transcription, translation, and cell cycle regulation. Many proteins that cause cancer are IDPs. The transcriptional activation domain of the Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family ( EAD ) is a type of IDP that is involved in protein-protein interactions without a coupled folding and binding process, a phenomenon known as "fuzziness." Researchers have studied the EAD to better understand this process and have found that it is driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts. This finding offers a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs.
Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, encodes a protein called lon that is homologous to the Escherichia coli lon protein. We have purified and characterized recombinant B. burgdorferi lon (rLon-1) and a mutant form of the protein, rLon-1S714A, in which a catalytically important serine residue has been mutated to alanine. Using these proteins, we have determined the optimal pH for rLon-1 proteolytic activity and the ability of rLon-1 to hydrolyze casein. We have also characterized the activity of rLon-1 in an insulin-chaperone-like assay. Our results demonstrate that rLon-1 has chaperone-like activity, suggesting that this protein may have a role in regulating protein folding within B. burgdorferi.
This article describes a type of immune response called antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) and its relevance in controlling viral infections. The article explains how ADP is different from other types of antibody-mediated immune responses, such as ADCC and neutralization. The article also highlights the importance of studying ADP in the context of HIV infection. The article concludes by providing an overview of the methods used to measure ADP and discusses future directions for research in this area.
In this study, we used a computational simulation model to estimate the global economic and health burden of hookworm infection. We found that in 2016, hookworm infection caused 2,126,280 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide, with 4,087,800 DALYs when cognitive impairment outcomes are included. The economic burden of hookworm infection also varies by country, with Brazil facing the largest burden and China facing a moderate burden. However, the model suggests that hookworm infection is associated with a significant economic burden worldwide, even when cognitive impairment is not included. The study highlights the need for more resources to be allocated to controlling hookworm infections and reducing their global burden.
The article describes the effects of hypoxia on axon pathfinding in the developing zebrafish brain. Hypoxia was induced using a specialized chamber that allows precise control of oxygen levels. The study used genetic and chemical modifiers of the hypoxic response to investigate the mechanisms of hypoxia-induced axon pathfinding errors. The results show that hypoxia disrupts axon pathfinding in zebrafish through an evolutionarily conserved mechanism, by activation of the hif1α pathway and increased expression of ephrinB2. The study also shows that magnesium sulfate helps reduce hypoxia-induced upregulation of ephrinB2 and decreases the frequency of pathfinding errors. The findings suggest that hypoxia-induced axon pathfinding errors may contribute to the adverse neurocognitive outcomes seen in preterm infants. The article provides important insights into the effects of hypoxia on axon pathfinding in the developing brain and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to protect against the adverse effects of hypoxia.
This study evaluated the changes in lung structure and density in an experimental model of pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) in mice. PCM is a fungal disease that affects the lungs, and the study aimed to understand the progression of the disease by using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathology. In this study, male BALB/c mice were infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Pb) conidia, and the progression of the disease was monitored by HRCT and histopathology. The results showed that the lesions were mainly located around the hilus and affected more frequently the left lung. HRCT showed that consolidation, peri-bronchial nodules, and confluent granulomatous reaction were the most common lesions. Histopathology revealed that consolidation was equivalent histologically to a confluent granulomatous reaction, while nodules corresponded to individual compact granulomas. Discrete focal fibrosis was visible gradually around granulomas, but this finding was only evident by histopathology. HRCT provided valuable information about the distribution and topography of the lesions and helped in understanding the progression of the disease. This study provides a useful tool for evaluating and quantifying pulmonary damage in experimental PCM models, which can help in the development of more effective treatments.
Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a potentially fatal disease caused by a parasite called Leishmania donovani. A modified IFN-γRA test has been developed to detect the cell-mediated immune response in VL. This test can potentially be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. The positive IFN-γ response to stimulation with leishmania antigens in patients with active VL was contradictory to the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Further research is needed to better understand this contradictory finding.
This study demonstrates the development of a mouse model of persistent Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infection. The mouse model recapitulates key aspects of human chronic yersiniosis, such as persistent bacterial colonization, commensalism with the host, and recurrent episodes of acute infection. The study also provides insights into the bacterial factors that contribute to chronic infection and the host immune responses that control Yersinia. These findings may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of chronic yersiniosis.
The article describes a mutant of the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae (the causative agent of rice blast disease) with a defect in the hyphal penetration process. The mutant was isolated from a screen for T-DNA insertion mutants that were defective in the penetration process, but had no other visible defects. The authors then went on to characterize this mutant and found that it was defective in the formation of appressoria, the fungal structures that are required for infection of host plants. The authors also found that the mutant was defective in the oxidative stress response and that it was able to form oxidative radicals during the hyphal penetration process. The authors suggest that the mutant could be useful for understanding the mechanisms of hyphal penetration and the roles of oxidative stress and the formation of appressoria in this process.
In this study, researchers used geographic information systems to map the distribution of Schistosoma haematobium in Ghana. They compared the predictions from this mapping tool with the actual prevalence of infection in schools from a survey conducted in 2010. The authors found that the predictions from the map were not always accurate and that there were instances where the map underestimated or overestimated the prevalence of infection in schools. They also found that the practical implications of using the map to make decisions about which schools to treat were not always clear. Overall, the authors suggest that mapping tools should be used as a tool to help inform decision-making, but not as a standalone tool, and that it is important to validate predictions from these tools with actual data.
In this study, we investigated the role of prostaglandins, which are derived from polyunsaturated fatty acids, in the regulation of sperm behavior and fertilization. Using mutations in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans, we showed that specific loss of prostaglandins affects sperm motility and fertilization efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the C. elegans oocytes secrete prostaglandins to promote sperm guidance and fertilization. Our study highlights the importance of prostaglandins in sperm behavior and fertilization.
Protein engineering is a powerful approach to deimmunizing biotherapeutic candidates, but deimmunization via the popular strategy of point mutations can be challenging and often fails to eliminate immunogenic potential while preserving function. To address this challenge, we present a novel design-based approach to deimmunization that leverages advanced protein engineering tools and in silico prediction of epitope content. Here, we describe the design and production of 18 Pareto optimal variants of Enterobacter cloacae P99 Beta-lactamase, a biotherapeutic target that has been previously deimmunized using conventional empirical methods. These variants were generated by using the protein engineering tool Pepfr, which finds the entire set of Pareto optimal designs by combining an immunogenicity-focused objective function with a function-focused objective function. We analyzed the immunogenicity and function of each variant using in silico and in vitro assays. Our results demonstrate that the immunogenicity and function of P99βL can be simultaneously optimized, and that this strategy results in deimmunized variants with improved function. Our findings illustrate the potential of advanced protein engineering tools and in silico prediction for the development of highly immunogenic biotherapeutic targets.
We show that elevated temperature can lead to increased recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana and that the extra COs are formed by the major Type I interference sensitive pathway. We also show that heat-induced COs are not the result of an increase in DNA double-strand breaks and that the hyper-recombinant phenotype is likely specific to thermal stress rather than a more generalized stress response. Our findings provide initial mechanistic insight into how environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination and may also offer practical applications.
This article describes a knowledge-based approach to integrating computational predictions and experimental data in a network to support biological hypothesis generation. The approach uses a network representation of the knowledge and the data, with nodes representing genes and edges representing relationships between them. The knowledge network is generated from literature curation, while the data network is generated from experimental data. The integration process involves combining the knowledge and data networks, allowing the exploration of the data in light of what is already known. Different methods for combining the networks are presented, including naive Bayes and likelihood ratio-based approaches. The article demonstrates the application of this approach using gene expression data and protein-protein interaction data.
This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the proteome of the extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by the parasitic liver fluke Fasciola hepatica. EVs are small membrane-bound vesicles that are released by many types of cells and can play important roles in intercellular communication. The authors identified 752 proteins in the F. hepatica EVs using mass spectrometry and found that many of these proteins were surface-exposed and were modified with glycan structures. They also found that the proteome of the EVs was different from the proteome of the tegumental surface of the fluke. The authors suggest that F. hepatica EVs could be used as a diagnostic tool for fasciolosis, the disease caused by infection with the fluke.
The cycling dof (CDF) transcription factor 2 (CDF2) interacts with DCL1, a key component of miRNA processing, to affect the transcription of a subset of pri-miRNAs in Arabidopsis. This finding reveals a novel link between transcription factor-mediated transcriptional control of miRNA genes and the processing of miRNAs. Additionally, the authors provide evidence that CDF2 functions as a transcriptional activator of pri-miRNA genes, and that it may play a role in the control of flowering time in Arabidopsis. This work has important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying miRNA-mediated gene regulation.
The study investigated the role of protein geranylgeranylation in the oocyte during early folliculogenesis. It found that the levels of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (Ggpps) increase in oocytes during early folliculogenesis, and this process is required for the proliferation of granulosa cells and the primary-secondary follicle transition. The study also found that the loss of Ggpps in oocytes blocks the oocyte-granulosa cell contact and the secretion of oocyte materials such as growth differentiation factor-9 (Gdf9). This study provides evidence that GGPP-mediated protein geranylgeranylation is essential for the establishment of oocyte-granulosa cell communication and the primary-secondary follicle transition, which is a key phase of folliculogenesis.
In this study, the authors have developed a model for the complete transcription bubble of RNA polymerase II, and have performed MD simulations to investigate the channels for NTP entry. They have constructed the model using existing X-ray and cryo-EM data, and have validated the model by comparing the simulation results with experimental data. The study provides new insights into the dynamics of NTP entry into the active site of RNA polymerase II, and has implications for understanding transcription regulation.
In this study, the authors used laboratory-confirmed cases of dengue illness to estimate the magnitude of underrecognition of dengue cases in Thailand and Cambodia. They collected data from two prospective cohort studies in Thailand and one in Cambodia, which included a total of over 21,000 children aged 3 to 19 years. The authors found that in Thailand, the estimated number of undiagnosed dengue cases was between 31,000 and 165,000 per year, while in Cambodia the number of undiagnosed cases was between 18,000 and 95,000 per year. These findings highlight the importance of improving the accuracy of national surveillance data in order to better understand the true burden of dengue illness in these countries.
The study described above investigates the effects of natural killer (NK) cell activation on antiviral immune responses in vivo. The authors use a mouse model where NK cells can be efficiently activated by the natural killer complex. They show that efficient NK cell activation leads to an acceleration of CD8 T cell responses against a viral infection, as well as to a reduction in the production of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). These results suggest that NK cell activation can have a positive impact on antiviral immune responses in vivo.
This study investigates the role of AtNUC-L1, a nucleolin-like protein, in the regulation of rRNA gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana plants. The study found that AtNUC-L1 plays a major role in controlling active and repressed rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis. The authors used a variety of techniques, including molecular cloning, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative PCR, to examine the effects of disruptions in the AtNUC-L1 gene on rRNA gene expression. They found that AtNUC-L1 plays a central role in a mechanism responsible for switching expression of rRNA genes that involves IGS transcription and symmetric DNA methylation. The authors suggest that AtNUC-L1 might be a key regulator of rRNA gene expression in plants.
We have successfully identified human cytosolic proteins that interact with HCMV UL38. These include components of the NuA4 acetyltransferase complex, the HDAC1 deacetylase complex and the TSC2/mSin3A transcriptional co-repressor complex. Interestingly, we found that CHD4 and RBBP4 proteins from the NuA4 complex were upregulated in HCMV-infected cells. Our study provides insight into the mechanism of HCMV gene regulation and highlights the importance of protein interaction analysis for understanding viral infection.
The researchers used phage display libraries to map the antibody repertoire of RSV in young children prior to and following RSV infection. They found that the number of antibodies bound to RSV-G increased significantly after RSV infection, while the number of antibodies bound to RSV-F did not change significantly. They identified several novel epitopes in RSV-F and RSV-G, including an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27. They also found that antibody binding to pre-fusion F was 2-3 times higher than to post-fusion form. For RSV-G, antibody responses were high following early RSV infection in children, but declined significantly in adults. They used Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) based kinetic analysis with panels of serum from different age groups (<2 yr; 10–14 yr; 30–45 yr) to delineate the evolution of the antibody responses. Their findings could help in the development of effective countermeasures including vaccines for RSV.
In this study, we examined the mode of action of emodepside, a macrofilaricide that targets ion channels. We found that emodepside targets SLO-1 potassium channels, which are expressed in different isoforms in male and female worms. We also found that an alternative splice variant of the SLO-1 gene, which is expressed in male muscle, is more sensitive to emodepside than the variant expressed in female muscle. Our findings suggest that the sex of the filarial worm may influence its sensitivity to emodepside and that this could be taken into consideration when designing macrofilaricide treatment regimens in humans.
The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) is a public health initiative led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The goal of the program is to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF), a parasitic disease that affects 1.3 billion people worldwide and causes debilitating symptoms such as swollen limbs and genitals. The GPELF recommends that countries conduct rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to detect circulating filarial antigens in order to determine the prevalence of LF and guide treatment programs. The RDTs currently in use are based on antibodies that recognize the W. bancrofti-specific carbohydrate epitope of the AD12 monoclonal antibody. However, these tests do not work well in areas co-endemic with Loa loa, a parasite that shares similar antigens with W. bancrofti. In this study, we used immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation to identify and purify L. loa antigens that are specific to that parasite and can be distinguished from W. bancrofti antigens. We also used proteomics to analyze and identify the proteins that make up the L. loa antigens. Our results suggest that the L. loa antigens are a complex mixture of proteins that can be purified and characterized using immunoblotting and proteomics. This information can be used to develop new diagnostic tests that are specific for L. loa and can be used in areas where co-endemicity with W. bancrofti is a problem.
In this article, the authors present a new analysis method for identifying ciliary genes in C. elegans, based on a combination of transcriptomics and network analysis. The authors use RNA-seq data from seven developmental stages of C. elegans to identify genes with similar expression patterns to known ciliary genes. They then use network analysis to group these genes into clusters based on their expression patterns. The authors validate their method by identifying known ciliary genes within the clusters and by analyzing the localization of known ciliary genes. They also use their method to identify new ciliary genes and analyze their localization. Overall, this study provides a novel approach for identifying ciliary genes in C. elegans and may help advance our understanding of the function and regulation of cilia in this model organism.
Brain cells called place cells fire at different rates in different parts of their environment. Scientists have known that place cells can be used to infer the animal's position. But they don't know how the brain does it. They think that the brain does not have access to independent stimulus measurements and has no prior knowledge of the stimulus space. They used hippocampal place cells as a model system. They found that knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals a surprising amount of structure in the underlying stimulus space, allowing the brain to construct its own internal representations. They also found that they could use these representations to accurately track the animal's position.
The paper describes a study that investigated the role of a specific inflammatory protein called interleukin-1 (IL-1) in viral fulminant hepatitis (FH). The study used a mouse model of FH, which was created by infecting mice with a virus called murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3). In the study, the researchers found that the virus infected mice that lacked a specific protein called interleukin-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) showed reduced levels of IL-1 in their blood and livers, as well as less severe liver damage. They also found that blocking the production of IL-1 in the virus infected mice prevented them from producing a specific type of reactive oxygen species (ROS) called superoxide, which is produced by a type of white blood cell called macrophages. The researchers also found that blocking the production of IL-1 in the virus infected mice reduced the production of another type of ROS called hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by a protein called NADPH oxidase. The study provides new insights into the role of inflammation in viral FH and suggests that targeting IL-1 and its production pathway could be a useful therapeutic approach for this disease.
Hookworm infections can cause severe anemia and iron deficiency in children in tropical areas, especially in pre-school children. Multiplex real-time PCR was used to determine hookworm species, prevalence, and infection load in pre-school children in Malawi. The results showed that Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale are prevalent in Malawi. Moderate and high infection loads of A . duodenale were significantly associated with severe anemia. Iron deficiency was positively associated with A . duodenale infection load. The results demonstrate the need for quantitative and species-specific screening of hookworm infections to combat severe anemia and iron deficiency in children living in resource poor settings.
This study investigated the role of COM-1, a protein that is homologous to the yeast protein CtIP/Sae2/Ctp1, in the process of meiosis during gametogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans. COM-1 was found to play a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are induced in germ cells during meiosis. The authors showed that COM-1-deficient germ cells repair DSBs through the error-prone pathway of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to a lack of crossovers (COs), extensive chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality. In contrast, germ cells defective for both COM-1 and Ku, another protein involved in NHEJ, were viable and proficient in CO formation. The authors also showed that COM-1 acts parallel to the nuclease EXO-1 to promote interhomolog HR at early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, thereby safeguarding timely CO formation. Together, their results uncovered the potentially lethal properties of NHEJ during meiosis and identified a critical role for COM-1 in NHEJ inhibition and CO assurance in germ cells.
This article describes the results of a study using a capuchin monkey model for aerosolized B . pseudomallei infection. The study aimed to identify and characterize the immunogenic proteins and polysaccharides produced by this bacterium, which cause melioidosis in humans and animals. The study used a 2-DE Western blot and mass spectrometry analysis to identify immunogenic proteins, and ELISA assays to quantify antibody concentrations to the whole cell lysate and individual proteins and cell wall antigens. The study identified several immunogenic proteins, including enolase, thiol peroxidase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, and heat shock protein 60. Additionally, two polysaccharides, capsular polysaccharide and type A O-polysaccharide, were identified as immunogenic. These results provide insight into the humoral response to B . pseudomallei infection and may inform the development of new diagnostic or therapeutic strategies for melioidosis.
The cell cycle is a series of events that are controlled by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) . Cdk1, also known as Cdc2, is an important kinase that is responsible for the transition from G2 to M phase of the cell cycle. In this study, researchers used biochemical and microscopy techniques to study the activity of Cdk1 during the transition from G2 to M phase in human cells. They found that Cdk1 activity is initially low in G2 and increases during the transition to M phase. This increase in activity is due to the dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and the activation of the Cdc25 phosphatase. The researchers also found that the translocation of Cdk1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during mitosis does not reduce its activity. These findings provide important insights into the regulation of Cdk1 activity during the cell cycle and its role in the transition from G2 to M phase.
HIV-1 is a diverse virus with over 7,000 subtypes, and current vaccines do not target all of the subtypes. The authors studied superinfected women and found that their neutralizing antibody responses were broad and did not target specific subtypes or epitopes. This suggests that vaccines that use diverse antigens, such as viral particles or plasma, may be effective against diverse HIV-1 strains.
HCMV is a common human herpesvirus that causes various diseases, including congenital abnormalities, dementia, and blindness. In this article, we will discuss the pathogenesis of HCMV in the nervous system. First, we will provide an overview of HCMV and its interactions with the host immune system. Then, we will describe how HCMV enters the nervous system and establishes a lifelong infection. After that, we will discuss the mechanisms by which HCMV causes various neurological diseases. Finally, we will provide suggestions for future research on the prevention and treatment of HCMV-related neurological diseases.
This study investigates the evolution of transcription factor (TF) binding in Drosophila embryos across four species of the melanogaster group. The authors analyze ChIP-seq data for four AP TFs (bcd, gt, hb, and kr) in each of the four species and compare the binding patterns. They find that although the TFs are bound in similar regions of the genome, their binding patterns are not conserved. The authors also show that the conservation of TF binding is influenced by the divergence of DNA motifs, the distance to the nearest gene, and the number of TFs bound to a locus. They also analyze mRNA levels for the same set of genes and find that they are correlated with the TF binding patterns.
In the year 2008, a study was conducted in two primary health centres in Thanjavur district, Tamil Nadu, India, endemic for bancroftian filariasis that had undergone eight rounds of mass drug administration. The study was carried out to determine age-specific infection patterns, distribution of infections by households and sites, and to identify 'hotspots'. The findings of the study indicate that antigenaemic persons were clustered both at household and site levels. The study also found that the prevalence of microfilaraemia and antigenaemia in children were not uniform across sites and age groups. Based on the prevalence of microfilaraemia and antigenaemia in children, 7 'residual' and 17 'transmission' hotspots were identified. The study concludes that spatial clustering of infections in the study area indicates the need for developing good surveillance strategies for detecting 'hotspots', adopting evidence-based sampling strategies and evaluation unit size for transmission assessment surveys.
This study is a systematic review of the community-effectiveness of temephos, a type of chemical larvicide that is used to kill mosquito larvae, in controlling dengue vectors and disease transmission. The study included 27 studies from 6 different databases and found that when used as a single intervention, temephos effectively reduced entomological indices, which are measures of mosquito infestation. However, when combined with other interventions, temephos did not have the same effect, and studies found that it was not sustained over time or reduced the immature stages of mosquito development. The authors suggest that further research is needed to determine the most effective way to use temephos in dengue vector control programs.
This research is about the role of cohesin in chromosome segregation during meiosis and mitosis. Cohesin is a complex that holds sister chromatids together during DNA replication and cell division. It is present along the length of chromosomes, but most abundant at the centromere and surrounding regions, called the pericentromere. This study shows that the budding yeast Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex and the replication fork-associated factor, Csm3, are important mediators of pericentromeric cohesion, but they act through different mechanisms. Components of the Ctf19 complex direct the increased association of cohesin with the pericentromere, while Csm3 is dispensable for cohesin enrichment in the pericentromere but essential in ensuring its functionality in holding sister centromeres together. The authors also found that Csm3 is not required for cohesin association with the pericentromere, but plays a role in cohesion establishment at the pericentromere that is non-overlapping with Iml3 and Chl4. Their results indicate that Iml3 and Chl4 ensure the association of cohesin with the pericentromeric region, to facilitate its subsequent incorporation into functional linkages through a replication-coupled step, which requires Csm3.
Dengue fever (DF) is a viral infection transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and causes a spectrum of clinical symptoms ranging from mild fever to severe hemorrhagic fever. The immune response to dengue virus involves the activation of various cell types such as T lymphocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells. In this study, we conducted a metabolomics and lipidomics analysis of serum samples from DF patients to gain insights into the host response to dengue virus. We identified a number of metabolites and lipids that were differentially regulated in DF patients compared to healthy controls. These include amino acids, phospholipids and sphingolipids. The metabolic pathways involved in the regulation of these metabolites and lipids include the tricarboxylic acid cycle, phospholipid metabolism, sphingolipid metabolism and the citric acid cycle. The results of this study provide a unique insight into the host response to dengue virus and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for dengue virus infections.
This article describes a study that mapped and analyzed networks of research institutions and researchers working on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in Germany and their collaborations with institutions and researchers from other countries. The study used bibliometric data from the SCOPUS database to identify publications with German affiliations that addressed 11 kinetoplastid and helminthic diseases and five NTD groups receiving the highest German government research funding. Co-authorship networks were created for each disease and their collaborating co-authors and collaborating research institutions. The study used OpenRefine software to clean the bibliometric data, OpenStreetMaps API to geocode research institutions, and Table2Net tool to create the networks. The networks were visualized using Gephi software, and researchers and research institutions were ranked by their occurrence count, h-index, and betweenness centrality. The study found that the share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research. The study also identified strong performers on an individual level and knowledge hubs within individual researcher networks. The study concludes that the mapping and analysis of research networks could help identify opportunities for collaboration and inform evidence-driven policy making.
Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) and Soil-Transmitted Helminths (STH) have been targeted by Haiti since 2000, with a strong mass drug administration (MDA) program. By 2012, the country had reached full national scale and was able to stop treatment for LF throughout almost all of it. This was achieved through several key programmatic elements, including community awareness and education, trust of drug distributors, direct observation, easy access to treatment, and quality data collection. The evidence of success lies in both the high treatment coverage obtained and the significant reduction in burden of infection. These efforts have helped establish best practices for NTD control, poised to address two future challenges: maintaining control of STH infections after the community-based LF treatment platform ceases and ensuring appropriate morbidity management for patients currently suffering from lymphatic filarial disease.
This study provides insights into the cell cycle regulatory mechanisms in S. meliloti, a plant pathogen that forms a mutualistic association with legume plants. The authors investigated the effects of depleting the CtrA protein, a master regulator of the cell cycle in bacteria, on the cell cycle progression and morphology of S. meliloti. They found that CtrA depletion led to a significant decrease in cell division rate, and that the cells became elongated and lost their typical rod shape. The authors further explored the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying these phenotypes and identified a number of genes that may be involved in the control of the cell cycle in S. meliloti. Overall, this study provides a foundation for understanding how the cell cycle is regulated in S. meliloti and how this regulatory network may be influenced by the bacterium's symbiotic relationship with plants.
Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium that can cause a severe and often fatal disease called tularemia. It is a facultative intracellular bacterium, meaning it can survive and replicate both inside and outside host cells. The ability of F. tularensis to survive and replicate inside host cells is important for its virulence. One way F. tularensis does this is by using a special protein called gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). GGT allows F. tularensis to use glutathione (GSH) as a source of cysteine when inside host cells. GSH is a molecule that is abundant in the host cell and is important for many cellular functions, including defense against oxidative stress. Without GGT, the ability of F. tularensis to use GSH as a source of cysteine is severely reduced, and the bacteria are strongly attenuated for virulence. This shows that GGT is important for F. tularensis to survive and replicate inside host cells, and for its ability to cause disease.
In this study, the authors examined whether different Leishmania species can fuse with each other's parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in infected mammalian cells. Leishmania is a parasite that causes a variety of diseases in humans and other animals, including cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral leishmaniasis. It has two main forms: promastigotes, which live in the gut of insect vectors, and amastigotes, which live in the host cell's cytoplasm. Promastigotes are flagellated and larger, while amastigotes are non-flagellated and smaller. In the study, macrophages were infected with L. amazonensis amastigotes and then superinfected with L. major promastigotes or amastigotes. The authors examined whether the two species could fuse their PVs using time-lapse image acquisition and determined whether the fusion would affect the survival, multiplication, and differentiation of the parasites. The authors found that L. major promastigotes were able to fuse with L. amazonensis PVs but L. major amastigotes were not. The authors also found that L. major promastigotes were able to multiply within L. amazonensis PVs but did not differentiate into amastigotes. In contrast, within their own, unfused PVs, L. major amastigotes differentiated into proliferating amastigotes. These findings suggest that the ability of Leishmania species to fuse their PVs may vary depending on the species and the form of the parasite.
In this study, we examined the neutralization capacity of monomeric and trimeric HIV-1 Env glycoproteins that were expressed on VLPs. We found that rabbit sera and guinea pig sera raised against native trimeric VLPs exhibited unique neutralization capacities compared to sera raised against monomeric gp120 or gp41 expressed on VLPs. We identified a potent neutralizing antibody (10E8) that was specific to a quaternary epitope of gp41 and that was able to neutralize a diverse panel of HIV-1 isolates, including Tier 2 isolates. The 10E8 antibody could neutralize HIV-1 isolates that were resistant to other antibodies and small-molecule drugs. Furthermore, we found that the 10E8 antibody bound to the native trimeric Env expressed on VLPs with high specificity and affinity. Our study provides insight into the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a skin disease caused by a bacterium called M. ulcerans. It is most common in rural areas of Africa and can be very serious if not treated. BU can be cured with antibiotics, but it can take a long time for the wounds to heal after treatment. Researchers have looked at different markers that could help them understand the process of wound healing after treatment for BU. They found that myofibroblasts, which are cells that make up scar tissue, were not present in untreated BU lesions. However, these cells emerged during the healing process and were found in areas with fibronectin, a protein that helps cells stick together. After antibiotic treatment, many cells, including myofibroblasts, showed an "activated" phenotype, which means that they were ready to perform their functions. The researchers also found that apoptosis, or programmed cell death, occurred in healing wounds and that cytokeratin 16 expression increased in the epidermis. They concluded that the markers they identified could be used to monitor wound healing in antibiotic-treated BU lesions.
The study presented in this paper investigates the role of axonal mitochondria in supporting impulse activity in vivo. Using a novel technique that combines confocal time-lapse imaging with electrophysiological stimulation of mammalian axons, the authors show that mitochondrial transport is modulated by neuronal activity in adult mammalian axons. Specifically, the study demonstrates that low frequency electrical stimulation reduces the velocity of axonal mitochondria, while high frequency stimulation increases the velocity of axonal mitochondria. These findings suggest that the regulation of mitochondrial transport may play a critical role in maintaining bioenergetic homeostasis in response to changing demands on axonal metabolism.
This article describes the characterization of a spinal disc degeneration phenotype in a mouse model with mutations in the Filb-n gene. The authors used a combination of histological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical techniques to analyze the discs of Flnb+/+ and Flnb–/–mice. They found that the Flnb–/–mice had a more ectopic differentiation of the annulus fibrosus cells, leading to abnormal endochondral ossification and disc degeneration. This phenotype resembled the degenerative disc disease seen in aging humans. The authors also demonstrated that the Flnb–/–mice had increased TGF-β activity in the discs, leading to the speculation that the mutation may alter the signaling pathways involved in disc degeneration. Overall, this article provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying spinal disc degeneration in Flnb–/–mice.
In a series of new studies, we reveal that the THOV protein, a member of the highly conserved THO/TIP export machinery, undergoes a novel immune evasion mechanism. We show that the THOV protein selectively recruits host translational factor IIB (TFIIB) into the nucleus, leading to depletion of TFIIB in the cytoplasm. This depletion of TFIIB impairs mRNA translation in the cytoplasm, leading to reduced induction of the interferon response. Our studies provide insights into how the THOV protein may evade host immune responses through a novel mechanism, and have implications for the development of new antiviral therapies.
We have summarized the information about B19V NS1-induced cell cycle arrest and the role of NS1 TAD2 domain in the dysregulation of the cell cycle. We have provided a detailed explanation of B19V NS1-induced cell cycle arrest and the role of NS1 TAD2 domain in the dysregulation of the cell cycle. We have also discussed the possible pathways that are involved in B19V NS1-induced cell cycle arrest and the role of NS1 TAD2 domain in the dysregulation of the cell cycle. We have provided a schematic representation of the pathways involved in B19V NS1-induced cell cycle arrest and the role of NS1 TAD2 domain in the dysregulation of the cell cycle. Finally, we have provided a lay summary of the information provided in the article.
This article describes the role of the endothelial glycocalyx (EGL), a layer of carbohydrate-rich molecules that covers the surface of blood vessels, in Dengue virus (DENV) infection. The authors review the literature on the relationship between DENV and the EGL and describe their own experimental studies, which suggest that DENV infection can cause EGL disruption and that this disruption may contribute to the development of severe DENV disease. The article also discusses the potential mechanisms by which DENV might disrupt the EGL and the implications of this disruption for the pathogenesis of DENV infection. Overall, the article provides an important overview of the current understanding of the relationship between DENV and the EGL and highlights areas where further research is needed.
In this study, the authors report the discovery of two yeast ubiquitin ligases, Dma1 and Dma2, that are required for proper septin dynamics and spindle positioning during mitosis. They found that the loss of these ligases impairs the function of the spindle position checkpoint (SPC) and leads to aneuploidy. The authors also identified Elm1 as a target of Dma1/2-mediated ubiquitination and showed that its recruitment to the bud neck is crucial for the correct SPC response. Their findings suggest that the integrity of the bud neck is important for proper SPC signaling.
The human genome is highly adapted to the diverse environments that humans have occupied throughout our history. In this study, we used data from 61 worldwide human populations to identify genetic loci that underlie adaptations to continuous climate variables. We focused on the summer and winter seasons, including precipitation rate, relative humidity, solar radiation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature. We also included latitude in our analyses. By using a Bayesian linear model method that controls for population history and accounts for differences in sample size among populations, we identified genome-wide significant SNPs with strong signals for adaptation to environmental variables. We found strong evidence for adaptation to pigmentation and immune response phenotypes. Our results also identify several novel candidate gene regions associated with climate and provide insights into the evolutionary history of human adaptation to climate.
SQT1 is a genetic disorder characterized by prolonged cardiac repolarization. Using a Markov chain model of IKr (the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current), we have compared the kinetic properties of WT and N588K-hERG/IKr. The Markov chain model reproduces the experimental data, including rapid activation and inactivation of IKr, and a shift in the voltage dependence of inactivation. The model has been incorporated into the TNNP human ventricular cell model, and was validated by comparison with data from the original TNNP model and the Luo-Rudy model. The model has been used to simulate the action potential in a single cell, and in 1D, 2D and 3D tissue models. We have simulated the initiation and conduction of an excitation wave, and have shown that in 3D, the presence of SQT1 mutation leads to transmural heterogeneity in the action potential and the re-entry excitation wave, which are not observed in the WT model.
In this study, the authors propose a new method for understanding the collective motion of animals using deep attention networks. They have found that by using attention modules, they can build a model that is both predictive and insightful. The model is able to recover the ground-truth interaction rule used to generate the data and also to identify the number of interacting neighbours. They have tested the model using simulated trajectories and experimental trajectories of 60-100 zebrafish. They have found that at high velocities, interactions correspond to alignment or alignment mixed with repulsion at close distances. They have also found that each zebrafish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average over neighbours. They have found that the weights are higher for neighbours that are close, in a collision path or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations. The network also extracts that the number of interacting individuals is dynamical and typically in the range of 8-22, with 1-10 more important ones.
In this study, the authors used a phylodynamic approach to estimate the fitness cost of major drug resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV cohort study (SHCS). They used a birth–death model to estimate the resistance evolution and reversion rates of major drug resistance mutations in the SHCS. The authors compared the transmission rates of hosts infected with drug-resistant and sensitive strains. They found that only the 90M mutation in the protease gene had significantly higher fitness than the drug-sensitive strains. The following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the drug-sensitive strains: 67N, 70R, 184V, 219Q. The highest posterior density intervals of the transmission ratios for the remaining resistance mutations included in this study all included 1, suggesting that these mutations do not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort. These patterns are consistent with alternative measures of the fitness cost of resistance mutations. Overall, the authors demonstrated that their phylodynamic approach can shed light on the dynamics of HIV resistance evolution.
The research in this paper focused on the role of the Elongator complex, which is involved in the modification of tRNAs, in the oxidative stress response of fission yeast. The authors found that the Elongator complex is not necessary for the transcriptional regulation of oxidative stress genes, but rather for the modification of tRNAs that affects translation efficiency. They also found that the absence of the Elongator complex affects the production of two oxidative stress proteins, Atf1 and Pcr1. The authors propose a model where the Elongator complex is required for efficient translation of oxidative stress proteins, which is critical for the survival of the cell under oxidative stress conditions.
Primate lentiviruses such as HIV-1 encode a protein called Nef that is important for viral replication and disease progression. In this study, the authors examined how Nef affects the sensitivity of HIV-1 to neutralizing antibodies. They found that Nef conferred up to 50-fold resistance to neutralizing antibodies that target a specific region of the viral envelope protein. This resistance was observed with different strains of HIV-1 and SIV, and was independent of the ability of Nef to enhance viral infectivity. The authors suggest that Nef may alter the recognition of this region of the viral envelope protein by neutralizing antibodies. They also found that Nef conferred resistance to neutralizing antibodies that target other regions of the viral envelope protein, but this effect was less pronounced. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that Nef plays an important role in protecting HIV-1 from neutralizing antibodies.
In this study, the authors used high-throughput sequencing and advanced bioinformatics analyses to characterize the transcriptomes of uninfected and Opisthorchis viverrini-infected Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos. They identified 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 43 distinct biological pathways, including pathways associated with immune defense mechanisms against parasites. Among the DEGs with immune functions, transcripts encoding distinct proteases displayed the highest down-regulation in Bithynia specimens infected by O. viverrini, whereas transcription of genes encoding heat-shock proteins and actins was significantly up-regulated in parasite-infected snails when compared to the uninfected counterparts. This study lays the foundation for functional studies of genes and gene products potentially involved in immune-molecular mechanisms implicated in the ability of the parasite to successfully colonize its snail intermediate host. The annotated dataset provided herein represents a ready-to-use molecular resource for the discovery of molecular pathways underlying susceptibility and resistance mechanisms of B. siamensis goniomphalos to O. viverrini and for comparative analyses with pulmonate snail intermediate hosts of other platyhelminths, including schistosomes.
This study aimed to investigate the association of genetic variants of the complement receptor 1 (CR1) gene with leprosy susceptibility in a Brazilian population. We genotyped nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CR1 using PCR-SSP and measured CR1 mRNA and soluble CR1 (sCR1) levels using real-time TaqMan PCR and ELISA, respectively. We found that the most frequent haplotype (CR1-HapA) was associated with increased risk of leprosy, especially in paucibacillary cases. We also observed that the allele CR1-rs3849266T was associated with increased risk of paucibacillary leprosy. In addition, we found that CR1-rs11118131C and CR1-rs11118167T were associated with increased risk of multibacillary leprosy. We also observed that higher levels of CR1 mRNA were associated with increased risk of multibacillary leprosy. Our findings suggest that CR1 genetic variants and mRNA levels may influence the susceptibility to leprosy, especially to the paucibacillary and multibacillary forms of the disease.
Researchers recently completed a study that involved more than 3,300 participants from the KORA F3 and F4 cohorts to investigate sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their underlying genetic determination. They found that there were significant differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites, indicating that the metabolite profiles of males and females are different. The study also showed that specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism. The researchers concluded that their study provides new important insights into sex-specific differences of cell regulatory processes and underscores the importance of studying sex-specific effects in research.
The authors propose a new formulation for the objective function in metabolic modeling, which they call Minimization of Metabolic Adjustment (MiMBl). MiMBl is designed to minimize the metabolic adjustment caused by a perturbation to a metabolic network. It takes into account the stoichiometry of the network and the fluxes of the metabolites involved in the perturbation. The authors demonstrate that MiMBl outperforms other objective functions commonly used in metabolic modeling, such as minimization of overall flux and maximization of yield, in terms of predicting the correct metabolic adjustment for a given perturbation. They also show that MiMBl is robust to changes in the stoichiometric representation of the network and the scaling of the objective function coefficients. Finally, the authors apply MiMBl to a case study of genetic interactions in the yeast metabolic network and show that it can successfully predict interactions that are not captured by other objective functions.
This article presents a study of the genetic structure of the black rat, Rattus rattus, in Madagascar. The black rat is a major host for the plague bacterium Yersinia pestis. The genetic structure of a population may influence its ability to transmit the plague, and it is important to understand the genetic structure of rat populations in order to control plague epidemics. In this study, the genetic structure of rat populations was investigated in four different areas of Madagascar that are affected by plague epidemics. Genetic markers were used to compare the genetic structure of rat populations within each area, and to compare the genetic structure of rat populations from different areas. It was found that the genetic structure of rat populations was different in each area, and that there was a strong correlation between genetic structure and geographic distance. This suggests that the dispersal of rats may be an important factor in the transmission of the plague.
This report describes the identification and characterization of 11 novel SmLy6 family members in the schistosome S . mansoni. This family is implicated in surface adherence and immunogenicity of the schistosome tegument. The authors found that SmLy6 proteins are glycoproteins with a predicted GPI anchor and therefore surface-localized. The authors identified putative orthologues of SmLy6 in S . haematobium and S . japonicum. They further confirmed the expression of SmLy6A-K in 14 life cycle stages of S . mansoni. The authors used structure prediction algorithms to generate 3D models of SmLy6 family members, which revealed a conserved structure. Finally, the authors used mice as a model organism to show the humoral immune response to recombinant SmLy6A and SmLy6B in endemic S . mansoni infection in humans, providing evidence that these proteins are immunogenic and surface-localized. This information may be useful for the development of novel vaccine candidates.
The study presents a computer simulation of the epithelial tissue in the Drosophila retina. The simulation minimizes global interfacial energy between cells, which is based on the timing of N-cadherin expression in cells and its temporal relationship to the remodeling of cell-cell contacts. The simulations reproduce the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells, distinguish features of cadherin dynamics, and emphasize the importance of adhesion protein biogenesis and its timing with respect to cell remodeling. The study also indicates that N-cadherin protein is recycled from inactive interfaces to active interfaces, thereby modulating adhesion strengths between cells.
We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments to determine the turnover rate of MT1-MMP at single invadopodia. We found that the fluorescence recovery was well-fitted by a double-exponential plot with time constants of 26 s and 259 s. The recovery was primarily dependent on vesicle transport, but negligibly on lateral diffusion. We then used the observed kinetics of the FRAP experiments to construct a computational model that successfully reproduced our FRAP experiments. We inhibited vesicle transport both experimentally and in simulation, and found that this blocked ECM degradation, indicating a crucial role of the rapid turnover of MT1-MMP in ECM degradation. We also showed that the extent of the reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of reduction in the MT1-MMP turnover. Finally, we showed a synergistic effect of the rapid turnover of MT1-MMP and proteolytic activity in ECM degradation. We conclude that our computational model provides a new in silico tool to design and evaluate intervention strategies in cancer cell invasion.
This paper describes a study that directly measures the dynamics of HIV-1 drug resistance evolution in macaques. The study compares viral populations in different body compartments and finds evidence of compartmentalization of drug-resistant viral variants in the macaque model of HIV-1 infection. The study provides evidence that drug-resistant variants may be emerging in vivo before detectable changes in plasma viremia are observed, and that changes in viral populations may be occurring in vivo in a manner that is distinct from what has previously been observed in vitro. The study has important implications for the understanding of HIV-1 drug resistance evolution and for the development of new strategies for the prevention and treatment of HIV-1.
A mathematical model shows how interactions between positive and negative diffusible signals can drive the development of morphological forms in tissues. This process can lead to bistability, self-sustaining elongation, branching and spatial self-organization. Such phenomena are not Turing patterns.
Myopia is a common eye disorder characterized by nearsightedness. The causes of myopia are multifactorial and include both environmental and genetic factors. In this study, we used genome-wide association studies to identify genetic associations with myopia in European individuals. Our results indicate that there are 22 genetic loci associated with myopia, including some that have not been previously identified. These loci are involved in various biological processes including neuronal development, eye growth, and scleral remodeling. Our findings provide insight into the complex genetic factors underlying myopia and highlight potential targets for future research and treatment.
In this paper, we will present a modified model for the swimming of a lamprey that incorporates body curvature feedback from mechanoreceptors in the skin. The model uses a chain of coupled oscillators to simulate the CPG, and an immersed boundary method to model the body and fluid dynamics. The feedback from the mechanoreceptors is implemented in two different ways, either as a directional feedback that depends on the direction of curvature, or as a magnitude feedback that depends on the magnitude of curvature. The model is tested by simulating the swimming of a lamprey in steady state and in a pulsing mode, and the effects of the different feedback mechanisms are compared. The results show that the directional feedback leads to more efficient swimming in the steady state, while the magnitude feedback leads to more efficient swimming in the pulsing mode.
HIV is a virus that spreads quickly and efficiently among humans. It is divided into different subtypes, each with its own characteristics. Some subtypes are better at spreading than others. One explanation for this is the first-come advantage. This means that the first subtype that arrives in a new population has a better chance of becoming dominant. It does this by out-competing the other subtypes that arrive later, and taking longer to be displaced by even more fit subtypes. This effect can be seen in the way that HIV is spreading around the world. It is also possible that the way that HIV is spreading is being affected by other factors such as interference, which refers to the ways that certain subtypes of HIV interact with each other. These factors can make it harder for a subtype to become dominant, by either reducing its ability to spread or by reducing the way that it interacts with other subtypes.
The content describes the organization of muscle cells during development. The authors suggest that extracellular cues are important for the organization of intracellular space in a way that supports the organization of myofibrils and their parallel alignment to form bundles. They used mathematical modeling and computer simulation to understand the mechanisms of muscle cell patterning. They also used traction force microscopy and immunofluorescence to visualize the structures and movements of muscle cells. The authors hope that their findings will be useful for understanding the development of heart muscle and the formation of heart disease.
The Wolbachia bacteria are being tested as a biocontrol agent in five Brazilian suburbs to reduce dengue transmission. The Wolbachia bacteria can invade and spread to infect all individuals within wild mosquito populations, but requires a high rate of maternal transmission, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, and low fitness costs in the host. Extensive differences in climate, field-release protocols, urbanization level, and human density among the sites where this bacteria has been deployed have limited comparison and analysis of its invasive potential. In laboratory experiments, the wMel Wolbachia strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission, and has no evident detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Mark-release-recapture experiments using Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes in two areas of Rio de Janeiro showed that the conditions by which the infection frequency reached 100% varied greatly between sites, and were strongly influenced by the size of the local mosquito population. Through analysis of laboratory, field, and mathematical data, the researchers show that the wMel strain of Wolbachia possesses the characteristics required to spread effectively in different urban socio-demographic environments, including those where mosquito releases from the Eliminate Dengue Program will take place.
This article provides a detailed characterization of the JMJ703 protein, a histone lysine demethylase, from rice. The authors demonstrate that JMJ703 is necessary for plant cell division and stem elongation, and that it specifically demethylates mono-, di- and trimethylated H3K4 in vitro and in vivo. They also show that a catalytic core of JMJ703 is sufficient for demethylation activity, and that key residues involved in the enzymatic activity are conserved in plant-specific JMJD2-like proteins.
HIV-1 capsid recruitment of host cell factors required for infection. The authors show that the HIV-1 capsid recruits host cell factors to promote infection through a multimeric interface involving NUP153, CPSF6, PF74 and BI-2.
This article describes the construction of a genetic linkage map for Ae. aegypti, a mosquito species that is a major vector of dengue fever. The map was constructed using genomic DNA from a backcross of mosquitoes, which allowed the identification of regions of the genome that were inherited from a specific parent. The map was constructed using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to identify the position of genetic markers on the map. The map was then used to identify regions of the genome that were associated with a resistance phenotype to the bacterial parasite Brugia malayi. The authors suggest that this map could be used to identify the genetic basis of resistance in Ae. aegypti and potentially lead to the development of strategies to enhance the resistance of mosquitoes to dengue fever.
This study was conducted in five mid-sized cities in Brazil, representing four distinct climate regions, to compare the efficiency of four different traps against Aedes aegypti with the traditional larval survey. The study lasted 24 months, and traps were installed in 15 different areas. The positivity and density indices were calculated for each trap, and they were found to be different between traps and cities. The density indices were consistently correlated with the entomological inference provided by the larval survey, suggesting that these trap indices can be used as complements or alternatives to the larval survey. The study also demonstrated that the choice of trap depends on its cost and ease of use, as well as the desired surveillance goals.
This study provides insights into the structure-function relationship of the antiviral protein A3G, which is a member of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases. The authors used homology modeling, mutational analysis, and crosslinking to identify key residues involved in the oligomerization, packaging, and antiviral function of A3G. They found that a mutation in a hydrophobic residue that is conserved across APOBEC proteins disrupted oligomerization and RNA binding, and reduced the antiviral activity of A3G. The authors also identified an arginine residue that is involved in oligomerization and that may contribute to the RNA editing activity of A3G. These findings provide important information for understanding the mechanisms of APOBEC-mediated antiviral activity and may have implications for the development of new antiviral therapies.
We sequenced the entire bab locus of 96 inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster, identified 6,756 polymorphisms, and found 1412 and 73 potential binding sites for the transcription factors Abd-B and Dsx, respectively. We found 51 SNPs associated with female abdominal pigmentation. Using allele specific expression, we found 11 SNPs associated with variation in bab2 transcript levels. Overall, our results demonstrate that large-effect QTL alleles can reflect the cumulative effects of many sequence polymorphisms, and suggest that functional elements of the genome are larger than previously thought.
This study investigates the effects of pneumococcal bacteriocins on the adaptability and pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) in a biofilm model. The authors demonstrate that S. pneumoniae can use pneumococcal bacteriocins as a source of nitrogen and phosphorus, and that these bacteriocins are involved in the regulation of blpA, a gene that encodes a regulatory protein involved in the production of S. pneumoniae bacteriocins. The authors also show that pneumococcal bacteriocins can be used as a tool to kill competing bacteria in a biofilm, providing a potential mechanism for S. pneumoniae to outcompete other microorganisms in the nasopharynx. Overall, this study provides important insights into the role of bacteriocins in the adaptability and pathogenesis of S. pneumoniae in the human host.
In this study, the authors investigated the role of the protein SRp20 in the IRES-mediated translation of poliovirus RNA. They found that SRp20 is a key component of the translation initiation machinery and interacts with the host protein PCBP2 in the translation of poliovirus RNA. The authors also showed that the interaction of SRp20 with PCBP2 is critical for the translation of poliovirus RNA, and that the deletion of SRp20 results in a significant decrease in virus yield.
The study by Banks et al. aimed to identify the genetic causes of various congenital abnormalities affecting the nervous system and endocrine glands. They used an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen with engineered mice carrying a LacZ cassette in place of the Sox10 gene, a transcription factor important for the development of melanocytes and other neural crest cells. The study identified four heritable mutations that altered the embryonic expression of Sox10LacZ, including one mutation caused by a single nucleotide substitution in the extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (Erbb3) gene. The Erbb3 mutation resulted in impaired epidermal growth factor signaling and embryonic lethality, demonstrating the importance of this receptor in neural crest cell development. The study provides insights into the genetic causes of various developmental abnormalities and highlights the role of epidermal growth factor signaling in neural crest cell development.
The study aimed to identify the factors that influence the reinfection rate of Schistosoma mansoni in the fishing community of Booma in northwestern Uganda. The study focused on the ethnic groups, Alur and Bagungu, who are known to have different levels of reinfection. The study used data from a previous study where individuals were treated with praziquantel twice and were followed for 22 months. Reinfection was assessed using faecal egg counts. The study found that the factors that influenced the reinfection rate of S. mansoni in Booma were age, ethnicity, sex, duration of water contact, and cercarial exposure. The study also found that there was a balance of IgE and IgG4 antibodies that were important in determining the reinfection rate. The findings of the study are important because they can help in identifying the individuals who are at high risk of reinfection and in developing strategies for reducing reinfection rates in the community.
Clonorchiasis is a disease caused by a type of parasitic worm called Clonorchis sinensis. To estimate the severity of infection in people with clonorchiasis, scientists use a method called stool examination. They count the number of eggs from the feces of infected people to determine how many eggs are being shed each day (called Eggs Per Gram or EPGs). In a new study, scientists collected adult worms from people with clonorchiasis and compared the number of worms to their EPGs. They found that there was a positive correlation between the two, meaning that the more eggs a person had, the more worms they were likely to have. The study also found that egg count per worm per day could be estimated at around 3,770 in an individual with EPGs of 2,664 and 106 worms collected. These findings help scientists estimate the severity of infection in people with clonorchiasis.
This study aimed to identify potential targets for novel therapeutics or combinations of drugs in the treatment of antimicrobial drug resistance. The researchers used a genome-wide screen in yeast to identify novel genetic components within interaction networks as potential targets in combination therapies. They focused on antifungal drug resistance and identified 18 synthetically lethal S. cerevisiae genetic mutants in cells expressing C. glabrata PDR1+ gain-of-function alleles. One mutant, lacking the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, was investigated further. Deletion or drug-mediated inhibition of Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles, and also inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments. The researchers concluded that their data provided proof of concept that synthetically lethal genetic screens can identify novel candidate proteins that, when therapeutically targeted, could allow effective treatment of drug-resistant infections.
Poliovirus (PV) replication is a complex process that requires the cooperation of many host and viral factors. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of PV replication is critical for developing antiviral therapies to treat or prevent PV infections. This study aimed to identify molecular markers of PV replication that could be used to develop antiviral therapies. To this end, the authors used a combined approach of in vitro studies, molecular cloning, and electron microscopy to identify membrane structures in PV-infected cells that are associated with PV replication.
The article describes a study that aimed to develop a new strategy for finding small molecules that could be used to treat Chagas disease, a parasitic infection that affects millions of people worldwide. The strategy involved using computer modeling to screen a large database of molecules and identify those that might be effective against the parasite. The researchers then tested the most promising molecules in experiments to see if they were safe and effective in killing the parasite. The article concludes that the strategy was successful in identifying several promising new molecules that could be used to treat Chagas disease.
The study describes the design and development of two DNA vaccines that encode the envelope protein of the yellow fever virus. The vaccines were constructed by amplifying the DNA sequence of the envelope protein from the YF 17DD virus strain and inserting it into a plasmid vector. The plasmid was then transfected into 293 cells and analyzed by Western blotting and fluorescence microscopy to verify that the envelope protein was expressed. The vaccines were also tested in mice, and the results showed that they were able to induce T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses that were comparable to those induced by the YF 17DD vaccine. Furthermore, both DNA vaccines were able to protect mice against lethal YF infection. Overall, the study provides a proof-of-concept for the development of DNA vaccines against YF, which may be useful for future vaccine development efforts.
The pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae uses the chitin from crustacean shells in its environment to survive and evolve by sharing genes. The genes needed to use chitin are controlled by the orphan sensor kinase ChiS. We used transposon mutants to discover that the SlmA protein is a new regulator of the chitin-using genes. SlmA has not been linked to gene regulation before. We found that SlmA binds directly to the chitin-using gene promoter and is required for their expression. We also found that SlmA's ability to regulate gene expression is linked to its ability to bind DNA, not to its role in controlling cell division.
This is a technical paper on a new computational method for solving dynamic systems with a large number of parameters. The method is based on algebraic formulations of the problem and uses Taylor approximations to discretize the differential equations and to obtain computationally efficient solutions. The authors introduce a new randomized maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach to solve the parameter estimation problem that uses random perturbations of the observed data to circumvent nonlinearities and constraint issues. They also propose an efficient algorithm for solving the MAP problem using interior point methods and a rigorous convergence analysis. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by applying it to several biological examples.
In this study, the authors utilized the nCounter molecular detection and quantitation system to analyze gene expression profiles in response to infection with West Nile virus (WNV) in various tissues of Swiss Webster mice. They identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the brain, spleen, liver, lung, and kidney tissues, as well as a panel of 179 inflammatory-related genes that were differentially expressed across all tissues. Additionally, they compared the gene expression profiles of WNV-infected mice to those of mice that were injected with saline, and identified genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups. Finally, they used the DAVID and STRING databases to perform functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction analysis, respectively, on the DEGs from each tissue. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the gene expression profiles in response to WNV infection in various tissues of Swiss Webster mice, which can be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of WNV infection and developing new therapeutic strategies.
Rabies is a serious illness that affects both humans and animals. It can cause death and is caused by a virus. In Mozambique, the majority of rabies cases are not reported and there is limited information available on the incidence of human rabies and animal bites. A rabies outbreak occurred in Maputo and Matola cities in 2014, which prompted the investigation of the incidence of human rabies and animal bites. Fourteen cases of human rabies were detected in Maputo and Matola cities and neighbouring Boane district during this time period. All cases had been bitten by a dog. Only one of the 14 rabid dogs had been immunized. The investigation included a case control study and community investigation. Factors significantly associated with human rabies were age under 15 years, bite by a stray or unimmunized dog, deep wound, bite on the head, and lack of post-exposure prophylaxis. The control measures for rabies are poor in Maputo and Matola cities. The introduction of the rabies vaccine, education campaigns for communities, and the removal of stray dogs are some of the ways to prevent the spread of rabies. The study highlights the need for improved prevention and control measures for rabies in Mozambique.
The study reported the identification of a new febrile seizure (FS) gene, SCN9A, which encodes Nav1 . 7, a type of sodium channel in the brain. The authors analyzed 21 affected individuals in a large Utah family with FS and found a potential mutation in a highly conserved amino acid called p . N641Y in the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II. To confirm the role of SCN9A in FS, the authors analyzed a collection of 92 unrelated FS patients and found 5% had missense variants in highly conserved amino acids in the gene. After one of these children with FS later developed Dravet syndrome (severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy), the authors sequenced the SCN1A gene, which is known to be associated with Dravet syndrome, and found a heterozygous frameshift mutation. Subsequent analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients yielded nine Nav1 . 7 missense variants (8% of the patients), all in highly conserved amino acids. Six of these Dravet syndrome patients with SCN9A missense variants also harbored either missense or splice site SCN1A mutations and three had no SCN1A mutations. This study provides evidence for a role of SCN9A in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations in Dravet syndrome.
In this section, we will provide a brief lay summary of the provided content. We have explained the basics of morphogenesis, including the concept of growth, polarity, and pattern formation. We have introduced the two main approaches to modeling pattern formation in tissues, namely the mechanical and regulatory approaches. We have then provided an overview of the GPT-framework, which is a computational tool for modeling morphogenesis based on the mechanical approach. We have highlighted the key features of the GPT-framework and how it differs from other mechanical approaches. Finally, we have discussed the limitations of the GPT-framework and some of the current research in this field.
The study investigates the patterns of HIV escape rates and their effects on CD8+ T cell killing efficacies. The study finds that the observed pattern of escape rate decrease (ERD) is likely caused by interference between mutations that occur at multiple sites in the HIV genome simultaneously, rather than independent mutations occurring sequentially. The study suggests that the underexponential decline of escape rates over time is a contributing factor to this phenomenon. The study highlights the importance of considering interference effects in the estimation of escape rates and mutation-associated selective coefficients, as current estimation techniques are inadequate for interference regimes. The study emphasizes the need for novel estimation methodologies based on the analysis of HIV strains, rather than mutation frequencies.
Our research group has developed a mathematical model that simulates the tumor volume changes in response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. The model is based on a discrete time and space stochastic cellular automaton and has been validated using a data set of 41 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The model allows for the prediction of tumor volume changes based on the applied chemotherapy regimen and provides an estimate of the cell kill rate for each proliferative cell type considered in the model. The model can be used to predict the efficacy of different chemotherapy regimens and to optimize the dosing schedule and duration of treatment in individual patients. The model can also be used to investigate the mechanisms of resistance to chemotherapy and to identify potential targets for the development of novel therapies.
Biofilm-associated antibiotic tolerance is a major health threat due to bacteria's high levels of tolerance to multiple antibiotics. Biofilm-associated antibiotic tolerance can be attributed to two distinct processes: persistence and drug indifference. Persistence refers to subpopulations of slow or non-growing bacteria, while drug indifference refers to the entire population. Although molecular bases of persistence are under active investigation, drug indifference is far less well understood and hypothesized to be multifactorial and to result from reduced antibiotic diffusion to slow growth rate of many cells within biofilms. Alternatively, local gradients of nutrients, oxygen, pH, signalling molecules and waste products, as well as genetic heterogeneity, which can arise through mutations, recombination, and stochastic gene expression, could lead to physiologically specialized subpopulations exhibiting high tolerance to extracellular stresses such as antibiotics. The SOS stress response induced in heterogeneous and nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments is a molecular mechanism leading to biofilm-specific high tolerance to the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin.
Malaria is a major global health problem, causing over 400,000 deaths annually, most of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa. The parasite that causes malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, requires a human host to reproduce and can cause severe illness and even death in humans. The cytoskeleton of P. falciparum merozoites is crucial for invasion of human erythrocytes, which is a vital step in the life cycle of the parasite. Understanding how the cytoskeleton of merozoites is controlled is important for developing new strategies to prevent and treat malaria. A new study published in PLOS Biology provides important insights into the role of cAMP in controlling the cytoskeleton of P. falciparum merozoites during invasion.
Strongyloides stercoralis is a type of roundworm that lives in the soil and can infect humans. This parasite is often neglected, and there is not much information about how many people are infected. A group of researchers looked at studies from around the world that were published in the last 20 years to get a better understanding of how many people are infected. They also looked at different groups of people, such as those with HIV/AIDS, to see if they were at higher risk for infection. They used a special computer program to analyze the data and found out that S. stercoralis infection is quite common in some areas of the world, especially in Africa, Asia, and South America. They also found that people with HIV/AIDS and alcoholism might be at higher risk for infection. Overall, the researchers say that S. stercoralis infection should not be overlooked and more research is needed to understand it better.
Circadian rhythms are daily changes in gene expression and physiology that persist even in the absence of external environmental cues. In mammals, such rhythms are organized in a hierarchical fashion, with cell-to-cell coupling keeping individual cells in tight synchrony in cultured cells. The damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can serve as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise and can be used to measure the effect of clock perturbations on stochastic noise. This study shows that higher noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level and that stochastic noise can be changed in a dose-dependent fashion by small molecule modulators. The study also shows that stochastic noise is altered independently of period, amplitude, and phase. Finally, the study hypothesizes that the unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as very few gene perturbations are capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering stochastic noise. This study demonstrates the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise, particularly with regard to the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics.
This study is about the drug target FtsZ, a protein that is essential for the division of bacteria cells. The study presents an analysis of the binding site of FtsZ for the drug PC190723. This analysis is done using a method called PocketFEATURE, which measures the similarity between the binding site of PC190723 and other binding sites from different proteins. The results of this analysis show that the binding site of PC190723 is dependent on the species and nucleotide-binding state of FtsZ. The study also includes a comparison of the binding site of PC190723 in different bacterial species, as well as the effect of different mutations on the binding site. The results of this study provide important information for the further development of FtsZ inhibitors.
In this study, we present the first crystal structure of the LEDGF-IN complex. The structure reveals that the N-terminal domain of LEDGF interacts with the NTD of IN, while the C-terminal domain of LEDGF binds the CCD of IN. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of concerted integration of HIV-1 and other lentiviruses into host chromatin, and suggest the use of LEDGF mutants for targeted lentiviral integration in gene therapy applications.
Cells in our body have their own set of kinetics that determine their behavior. When cells become cancerous, they inherit these kinetics, which determine how the cancer progresses. The kinetics can change due to genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations. Some of these changes can be favorable and increase the fitness of cancer cells, causing them to grow faster and form tumors. In this study, we developed a mathematical model to track how the kinetics of cancer cells change over time. We focused on several traits that are important for cancer progression, including cell migration, cell division, cell death, and telomere length. We found that proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth. When proliferation potential is increased, it leads to larger populations of non-stem cancer cells, which can inhibit the division of cancer stem cells. When proliferation potential is decreased, it loosens this inhibition and allows for frequent division of cancer stem cells. We also found that cancer stem cells become more heterogeneous over time, which can result in different populations of cancer cells with varying kinetics. This study can help us better understand how cancer progresses and how it may be treated.
The paper describes a mathematical model of how a pathogen can adapt to humans and spread from animals to humans. The paper focuses on the case of the influenza A (H5N1) virus, but the model is general enough to be applied to other zoonotic diseases as well. The paper shows that the probability of a zoonotic infection becoming established as a human-to-human infection is highly dependent on the rate of evolutionary adaptation, which determines how well the virus can adapt to humans. The paper also shows that the probability of emergence depends on the spatial structure of the human host population, such as the number of villages and cities and the amount of contact between them. The paper uses a branching process model to show that emergence can be predicted with a high degree of certainty in large populations. However, in small populations, emergence is inherently unpredictable. The paper shows that the spatial structure of the human host population has a negligible effect on the probability of emergence in large populations, suggesting that evolutionary factors are more important.
This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity and patterns of reassortment of influenza A viruses isolated from wild birds in Canada and the United States. We analyzed 287 full genomes of influenza A viruses collected over a 25-year period from two distinct populations of migratory waterfowl. Our analysis reveals that the genetic diversity of influenza A viruses in these two populations is relatively low, indicating that the viral populations are structured and not randomly mixed. This suggests that the evolution of influenza A viruses in these two populations may be influenced by geographic barriers to migration, such as the Rocky Mountains. We also found evidence of genetic reassortment between these two populations, which may have important implications for the evolution of influenza A viruses in North America.
The present study describes the generation of a novel cross-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb) designated MAb S139/1, which is specific to influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA). MAb S139/1 binds to a common antigenic site shared among a variety of HA subtypes and neutralizes viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo. The findings of this study demonstrate the potential of cross-reactive antibodies in heterosubtypic immunity against influenza A virus infection.
The study aimed to assess the effect of ivermectin treatment on the prevalence of S . stercoralis infection in an Aboriginal community in northern Australia over a three-year period and to assess the validity of using a lower ELISA cut-off in diagnosis. A three-year cohort study of 259 adult Aboriginal adults living in a remote community in northern Australia was conducted. S . stercoralis infection was diagnosed using commercial ELISA testing and a lower threshold for treatment was used than that recommended. Follow up was conducted at 6 months and 3 years following ivermectin treatment. Treatment with ivermectin was highly effective and resulted in a sustained fall in the prevalence of infection in the study group. Results of treatment suggested the use of a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was valid in this setting. Follow-up identified a small group of subjects with persistently positive ELISA serology despite repeated treatment. The study highlights the importance of following up with patients after treatment to ensure that the infection has been eliminated.
In this study, the authors investigate the ability of relatively low prion conversion efficiency strains to interfere with each other in vivo and in vitro and the contribution of PrPC in this process. They found that long incubation period strains, when present in the same host, can interfere with each other and this is likely dependent on the relative onset of conversion of the blocking and superinfecting strain. They also found that a mixture of long incubation period strains does not completely block one strain from causing disease, suggesting that strain interference may be limited to specific strains. These findings have important implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of prion strains from a mixture.
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and regions (IDRs) have been shown to play a role in allosteric regulation, despite their lack of ordered structures. The comprehensive ensemble model proposed here compares the roles of ordered and disordered proteins in allostery. It is shown that the order-order transition (MWC mechanism) and the disorder-order transition (EAM mechanism) have comparable contributions to allostery in the comprehensive model. The results suggest that IDPs/IDRs may be advantageous for allosteric regulation due to their high probability of being in the disordered state, which facilitates the order-disorder transition. This is in contrast to the previous EAM model, which considered only the order-disorder transition and found IDPs/IDRs to be less advantageous for allostery. The results of the study have implications for the design of allosteric drugs.
The article titled "β-Catenin promotes the formation of squamous epithelium during prostate development" discusses the role of a protein called β-Catenin in the development and function of the prostate gland. The prostate gland is a small gland located in the male reproductive system that produces a fluid that helps to liquefy and transport sperm during ejaculation. The article describes how β-Catenin is important for the growth and branching of the ducts that make up the prostate gland during development. The article also discusses how β-Catenin is important for the proper differentiation of prostate cells into the different types of cells that make up the prostate gland. Finally, the article describes how β-Catenin is important for the function of the prostate gland in adult males. Overall, the article provides important insights into the role of β-Catenin in the development and function of the prostate gland.
Researchers need to understand the local culture and beliefs of the community where they are conducting a study. This is especially important when conducting research in developing countries. Informed consent is a crucial part of ethical research. It is important to ensure that participants understand the information provided and are able to make an informed decision about whether to participate in the study. Informed consent is often not an easy process, especially in places where the majority of people are not literate. In these situations, it is important to use appropriate language, provide appropriate information, and take into account any cultural differences that may affect the process of informed consent. In a genetic study of podoconiosis in southern Ethiopia, the researchers conducted a rapid assessment to understand the local culture and beliefs about informed consent. They used a combination of focus groups and in-depth interviews to gather information. They found that it is important to provide information in a way that is appropriate for the local population and to take into account any cultural differences that may affect the process of informed consent. By doing so, the researchers were able to develop an informed consent process that was appropriate for the local population and ensured that participants were able to make informed decisions about whether to participate in the study.
This study investigates the dynamics of T cell proliferation in vivo during an EdU labelling experiment, in the thymus and spleen of FVB and C57BL/6 mice at 2 and 18 months of age. The proliferation rate of T cells was calculated according to the rate of EdU labelling of S phase cells during pulse and chase phases. The results show that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, but with a specific "signature" that depends upon genetic origins, is specific to cell differentiation stages in thymus and spleen, and is altered with age.
Mitochondrial tRNA mutations can cause severe human diseases with variable penetrance. We found a new pathological mutation in a mouse mitochondrial tRNA that is similar to a human mt-Ti mutation. This mutation causes an abnormal folding of the mt-tRNAIle and is responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in the mutant cells. We also found that this mutation can be partially suppressed by mitochondrial biogenesis, a process that is normally enhanced by increased ROS production. We conclude that this mutation and others like it may facilitate the evolution of pathological mtDNA mutations in humans.
In this study, the authors compared the expression of X-linked genes to that of autosomal genes in human triploid cells. Triploid cells have three sets of chromosomes: one set of sex chromosomes (X or Y) and two sets of autosomal chromosomes. The authors used expression arrays to analyze the expression of X-linked and autosomal genes in triploid cells with one or two active X chromosomes (Xa). They found that the average expression ratio of X-linked to autosomal genes was approximately 1 in normal diploid cells but was lower in triploid cells with one active X chromosome and higher in triploid cells with two active X chromosomes. This suggests that the X chromosome expression is not strictly adjusted to achieve a perfect balance in triploid cells. The authors also found that there was a range of individual X-linked gene expression levels in relation to ploidy, and that a small subset (∼7%) of genes had expression levels apparently proportional to the number of autosomal sets. This suggests that there may be an epigenetic mechanism that senses the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets. The authors conclude that their findings support the idea of epigenetic regulation of X chromosome expression in triploid cells.
The dN/dS ratio is a commonly used measure to quantify selection pressures on protein-coding regions. It is calculated by comparing the rates of substitutions at non-silent and silent sites, and is expected to exceed unity if selection promotes changes in the protein sequence. However, the relationship between dN/dS and selection is not always straightforward, and the expected value of dN/dS is dependent on the population size and the selection pressure. In this study, the authors analyze the relationship between selection pressures and dN/dS in samples drawn from a single population, and find that it is relatively insensitive to selection pressure. They also show that the signature of positive selection across divergent lineages, dN/dS>1, does not hold within population: strong positive selection is expected to produce dN/dS<1 among population samples. These results have important implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples, and suggest that the standard interpretation of dN/dS is unjustified when applied to intra-specific samples.
The idea that natural selection has no effect on linked genetic variation has been an important assumption in population genetics. However, a number of recent studies have suggested that natural selection may have a stronger effect on linked genetic variation than previously thought. In this study, the authors explored whether natural selection could affect linked genetic variation between species with different divergence times. They examined the relationship between genetic diversity, functional elements, and recombination rate across several species pairs. The authors found that for species with short split times, genetic diversity near functional elements was reduced. This reduction in genetic diversity was consistent with the idea that natural selection could be affecting linked neutral sites. The authors also performed simulations to explore whether selection in the ancestral population could generate the empirical patterns. They found that selection in the ancestral population could reduce the level of genetic diversity in the descendant populations. These findings suggest that natural selection may have a stronger effect on genetic variation than previously thought.
The circadian clock controls the daily rhythms of biological processes, and its disruption leads to various diseases including cancer. The mammalian circadian clock consists of two main transcriptional-translational feedback loops, which are regulated by the negative regulators PERIOD (PER) and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY) proteins and the positive regulators CLOCK (CLK) and BMAL1 proteins. The loops regulate each other and the target genes involved in various physiological processes such as sleep, metabolism, and stress response. Previous studies have shown that the circadian clock is controlled by post-transcriptional modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. In this study, the authors identified the CK2α kinase as a novel post-transcriptional regulator of the circadian clock. They showed that CK2α phosphorylates PER and TIM proteins, leading to their degradation. They also showed that the knockdown of CK2α in mouse brain leads to an increase in PER and TIM protein levels, resulting in an extension of the period of the circadian rhythm. Overall, the authors identified a novel post-transcriptional regulator of the circadian clock and showed that it controls the daily rhythms of biological processes.
Cruzipain, a cysteine peptidase from Trypanosoma cruzi, is involved in the adhesion of the parasite to the posterior midgut of Rhodnius prolixus.
The study identified twenty genes that suppress a cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans roundworm. The study used a genetic screen of a conditional cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutant at a semipermissive temperature with a genome-wide RNA interference library to reduce gene functions. The identified genes were found to suppress the dynein mutant but not other conditionally mutant loci, and twelve of the 20 specific suppressors did not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function was reduced in wild-type worms. The study also found 29 additional genes that when reduced in function, suppress conditional mutations not only in dynein but also in loci required for unrelated essential processes. The study concludes that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during the essential process of mitosis.
In this study, researchers investigated the role of Ku in programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in Paramecium tetraurelia, a unicellular eukaryote. Ku is a complex of two proteins, Ku70 and Ku80, that is essential for the repair of DSBs through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in somatic cells. Paramecium undergoes a unique form of meiosis called sexual transformation, during which the germline nucleus is transmitted to the progeny while the somatic nucleus is destroyed and a new one is formed. In this process, massive genome rearrangements occur, including the precise excision of internal eliminated sequences (IESs), which are repeated sequences that are not needed in the new MAC. Ku70a and Ku80c are specifically expressed in the new MAC and are essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus. The researchers used RNA interference to knock down Ku80c and found that DSB repair was impaired, leading to the accumulation of DNA breaks in the new MAC. Furthermore, Ku70a/Ku80c was found to interact functionally and physically with the domesticated transposase PiggyMac, which is responsible for DNA cleavage at IES boundaries. Overall, the study shows that Ku plays a crucial role in programmed DSB repair during sexual transformation in Paramecium.
In this study, we used laser capture microdissection to isolate neurons from the hippocampus of mice infected with scrapie, a prion disease. We then used a combination of microarray analysis and real-time PCR to determine gene expression changes in these neurons. We found that there were significant changes in gene expression over time, with many genes involved in synaptic and neuronal function showing alterations. We also identified miRNAs that were differentially expressed over time, with many of these miRNAs having predicted targets that were enriched in synaptic and neuronal function. These data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying prion disease progression and may inform therapeutic approaches.
The article aims to provide a new mathematical model that simulates the granuloma formation in the liver of mice infected with the parasite L. donovani. The model is based on stochastic Petri nets, which are a type of mathematical modeling that allows for the simulation of complex systems of interacting entities. The authors conducted a series of experiments to test the accuracy of the model and found that it was able to reproduce many of the key characteristics of the disease observed in mice, including the presence of granulomas in the liver, the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection, and the production of cytokines by these cells. The authors also tested the model's ability to predict the effects of different treatments on the course of the disease and found that it was able to accurately simulate the effects of several different treatments. Overall, the article demonstrates the potential of stochastic Petri nets as a tool for simulating complex immune responses and for predicting the effects of different treatments on these responses.
Researchers have found that a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They have also found that by changing the parameterization of the model, it can approximate equality and inequality operations. Additionally, they have found that multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter can be used to approximate any analytic function. These findings are important for interpreting naturally occurring networks and suggest new possibilities for designing synthetic networks.
The study analyzed CHIKV genomes from a recent outbreak in the Northeast region of Brazil. The results show that both Asian/Caribbean and ECSA genotypes expanded their ranges and are cocirculating in the Northeast region of Brazil. In addition, the study provides evidence of coinfection of ECSA and Asian/Caribbean CHIKV genotypes in naturally infected human individuals, and molecular clock analysis estimates that the ECSA genotypes spread northwards around mid 2015.
This research shows that the H-NS protein in bacteria can differentially regulate core genome DNA and DNA acquired through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). The H-NS protein from a plasmid in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, called R27, has evolved to selectively silence HGT genes, while not interfering with the regulation of the core genome. This study also shows that the Hha protein is required for differential regulation of HGT genes by H-NS, while H-NS homoligomers regulate core genes. These findings provide new insights into how bacteria can adapt to new environments by regulating their DNA.
This study is a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of the Leishmania parasites during their life cycle. The authors compared the expression profiles of three different Leishmania species (L. major, L. braziliensis, and L. infantum) using high-throughput RNA sequencing. They identified differentially expressed genes between the three species and during the life cycle stages of the parasite. The study provides a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians working on Leishmaniasis.
The article describes the development and evaluation of a molecular method based on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique for the detection of Amphimerus sp. liver fluke DNA in human stool samples. Amphimerus sp. is a fish-borne parasite that causes amphimeriasis and has recently been reported as endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador with a high prevalence in humans and domestic animals . The diagnosis of amphimeriasis is currently based on the stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but it lacks sensitivity and may be confounded with other liver and intestinal flukes. The molecular method developed in this study is highly sensitive and specific for the detection of Amphimerus sp. DNA in clinical samples and has the potential to be adapted for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphimeriasis-endemic areas.
The provided content includes a lay summary of a research article titled "Ykt6, a novel autophagy-associated protein, regulates autophagic SNARE complexes in Drosophila". The lay summary explains that the study is about the protein Ykt6, which is involved in the process of autophagy in fruit flies. The authors found that Ykt6 interacts with the proteins Vamp7 and Snap29 to form a tetrameric complex that facilitates autophagosome-lysosome fusion. They also found that loss of function of Ykt6 leads to an accumulation of undigested autophagosomes in the cytoplasm, and that the mutant flies exhibit defective lysosome function. The authors conclude that Ykt6 plays an important role in regulating autophagic SNARE complexes in Drosophila.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are important for innate immunity, and they have been shown to have antimicrobial activity against Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a common colonizer of the human upper respiratory tract. The SapBC permease is an outer membrane protein complex that has been shown to be important for the antimicrobial activity of NTHi against chimeric antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) and LL-37. In this study, the authors show that the SapBC permease is required for the antimicrobial activity of NTHi against CAPs. They also show that the SapBC permease is important for the sensitivity of NTHi to the antimicrobial activity of LL-37. The authors conclude that the SapBC permease is important for the antimicrobial activity of NTHi against CAPs and LL-37, and that it may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
The study aims to investigate the role of active degradation in shaping how the master transcription factor MarA coordinates its downstream targets in Escherichia coli. MarA controls a variety of stress response genes and active degradation of MarA has a short half-life compared to other cellular proteins. The authors modify MarA's half-life by knocking down the protease that targets it via CRISPRi or by engineering MarA to protect it from degradation. The study found that active degradation can impact both the rate of coordination and the maximum coordination that downstream genes can achieve. The authors also found that perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination show that trade-offs between these properties are impossible. The study has implications for the regulation of stress response genes in bacteria and suggests that active degradation plays an important role in shaping the kinetics of gene expression.
Leishmania parasites are transmitted by sandflies and can cause a range of skin lesions depending on the species. MKP-2 is a protein that helps control the immune response to these parasites, but we didn't know much about how it worked. In this study, we looked at how MKP-2 affects the immune response to L. major, a species that can cause lesions that eventually heal on their own. We found that MKP-2 deficient mice had a more severe infection than wild-type mice, with more parasites and bigger lesions. We also found that these mice had a lower type-1 immune response, which is important for fighting off parasites. However, the type-2 immune response, which is usually associated with allergic reactions, was also lower in the MKP-2 deficient mice. This suggests that MKP-2 is important for both type-1 and type-2 immune responses, but in different ways. We also looked at how MKP-2 affects macrophages, which are important cells in the immune system. We found that MKP-2 deficient macrophages were more susceptible to infection with L. major, but that if they were activated by LPS and IFN-γ, they were just as effective at killing the parasites as wild-type macrophages. This means that MKP-2 doesn't affect the ability of macrophages to kill parasites, but it does affect their ability to resist infection in the first place. Overall, our results suggest that MKP-2 plays an important role in the immune response to L. major, but that it affects both type-1 and type-2 responses in different ways.
The pancreas is a simple, stereotypical organ with a ductal tree that follows a predictable pattern of growth and remodeling. Using a combination of live imaging, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and computational modeling, the authors describe the process of pancreatic ductal remodeling in detail. They find that the ductal system in the developing pancreas is stereotypical at each stage and that the remodeling of the ductal network can be described using a simple set of rules. The authors' work has important implications for our understanding of the development of other organs with branching tubes.
In this study, we used computational methods to analyze the kinesin motor domain and understand the mechanism of its large-scale conformational changes. We performed dynamic network analysis, cross-correlation analysis, and principal component analysis on crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the α4–α5 subdomain undergoes a conformational change from a protruding to a retracted state. We also identified a cluster of residues in the loop8-β5 region that are dynamically connected to the α4–α5 subdomain. These findings provide insight into the mechanism of conformational changes in the kinesin motor domain and its function.
The bacterial Lux system is a gene expression reporter that is used to measure gene transcription in bacteria and eukaryotes. It is fast, sensitive, and non-destructive, making it useful for high-frequency measurements. However, the Lux system is complex, and the bioluminescence it produces is affected by a variety of factors that can make it difficult to interpret. In this study, the authors developed a computational model of the Lux system that includes a new mechanism for LuxAB and Fre reactions and new experimental data for the LuxAB reaction from Photorhabdus luminescens—the source of modern Lux reporters. They also improved the mechanisms for all reactions and synthesis and turn-over of Lux proteins. Using this model, the authors were able to reverse engineer promoter activity from the bioluminescence, which allows them to better interpret Lux assays.
The article discusses the discovery of three drugs that are effective in treating hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) caused by enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). The authors used a crystal structure of CVA16 to identify key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor GPP3. They then used in silico docking to investigate the interactions of GPP3 with two next-generation capsid binders NLD and ALD. The authors conducted a meta-analysis using the available structural information to gain a deeper insight into the structural features required for capsid binders to interact effectively and those that confer broad-spectrum anti-enterovirus activity. Overall, their findings have important implications for the development of new drugs to treat HFMD.
In this study, the authors explore the role of low-density lipoprotein receptors in the Toll-mediated immune response of Drosophila. They find that the serpin Necrotic is taken up in the garland and pericardial athrocytes by LpR1 and LpR2, and that these cells are responsible for degrading Necrotic through multi-vesicular bodies and delivering it to lysosomes. The authors also show that Necrotic uptake is visibly increased after 30 minutes and peaks at 6-8 hours following infection. The study sheds light on the mechanisms of serpin turnover and the role of endocytosis in the immune response of Drosophila.
This study reveals that the BMP signal is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in the small micromeres, of sea urchin embryos. This study also showed that BMP signaling is required for activating the expression of the left-sided genes and the formation of the left-sided structures. In addition, Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling and control LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres. These findings suggest that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved in deuterostomes.
This study investigates the mechanisms underlying the block to viral immediate early (IE) gene expression during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The authors found that CDK inhibition, either by checkpoint activation or the chemical inhibitor roscovitine, was sufficient to fully restore virus permissiveness in S/G2 cells. They also found that CDK inhibition was also successful in antagonizing the silencing of lytic gene expression during quiescent, latent-like infection of undifferentiated NTera2 (NT2) cells. These results suggest a mechanistical link between cell cycle and latency-associated repression of IE gene transcription and highlight the importance of CDK activity in the outcome of infection.
HIV-1 elite controllers can maintain undetectable levels of HIV-1 replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and this is mediated by the generation of highly-efficient HIV-1-specific T cell responses. However, the mechanisms that support the development of these protective T cell responses are incompletely understood. We found that dendritic cells (DCs) from elite controllers have the ability to effectively mount cell-intrinsic type I interferon (IFN-I) secretion in response to HIV-1 infection, which supports effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses. These data suggest that cell-intrinsic IFN-I secretion plays an important role in dendritic cell-mediated immune control of HIV-1.
Scientists have found 66 genes that cause fat cells to get bigger and store more fat in flies. One of these genes is a type of protein called Sir2, which helps regulate energy storage and utilization in cells. The Sir2 gene was discovered using a simple and quick screening method that measures how well flies float in a sugar solution. The team also discovered that Sir2 mutant flies live longer than normal flies when fed sugars but not amino acids, suggesting that Sir2 helps flies use food efficiently and balance their energy needs.
The aim of this study was to analyze the process of asymmetric cell division in 42 species of nematodes, all closely related to the well-studied Caenorhabditis elegans. By recording the first embryonic division of each species, the researchers obtained a collection of subcellular phenotypes that they could use to study the evolution of various cellular processes. Specifically, they analyzed the positioning of the mitotic spindle during cell division and found that, while all species underwent an asymmetric first cell division, there was large variation in the degree of cell asymmetry and in several parameters controlling spindle movement. These parameters included spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Importantly, these parameters changed frequently during evolution with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, except for spindle transverse oscillations, which were an evolutionary innovation at the base of the Caenorhabditis genus. These changes were also unrelated to evolutionary variations in embryo size. The findings of this study suggest that, while the essential process of asymmetric cell division has been conserved over the course of nematode evolution, the underlying spindle movement parameters can combine in various ways.
The DNA binding protein OmpR plays a key role in the regulation of virulence factors in Salmonella Typhimurium. In this study, the authors have investigated the differences in OmpR regulation between S. Typhimurium and Escherichia coli. They found that while both species have identical amino acid sequences in OmpR, there are differences in how it is regulated. In E. coli, OmpR is regulated primarily by the phosphorylation of its histidine residue by the EnvZ sensor kinase. On the other hand, in S. Typhimurium, OmpR is regulated by both phosphorylation and DNA topology. The authors also found that while there is a relatively high degree of specificity for DNA binding by OmpR in both species, there is also a significant degree of flexibility in the DNA binding motifs recognized by OmpR. These findings suggest that OmpR has evolved to be a versatile transcriptional regulator that can bind to a wide range of DNA sequences to regulate different virulence factors in different environments.
The study reports the characterization of a novel bacterial protein secreted through the type III secretion system of Chlamydia trachomatis, a human pathogen. The protein, named NUE (nuclear effector), is a histone methyltransferase that targets mammalian histones in the nucleus. It has enzymatic activity and is found in the soluble nuclear fraction and in chromatin-associated proteins. It is the first nuclear effector identified in chlamydiae. Its potential role in pathogenesis is discussed.
This paper investigates the association between genome-wide homozygosity and adult height. The authors found a highly significant inverse association between height and genome-wide homozygosity, equivalent to a height reduction of up to 3 cm in the offspring of first cousins compared with the offspring of unrelated individuals, an effect which remained after controlling for the effects of socio-economic status. This suggests that height is influenced by the combined effects of many recessive genetic variants.
This study examined the immune response of blood monocytes in patients with malaria. The authors found that certain subgroups of monocytes had different functions and were associated with different levels of parasitic activity. The authors also found that the level of antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADCI) activity was correlated with the percentages and absolute numbers of certain subsets of monocytes, and that the highest levels of ADCI activity were associated with the highest percentages and absolute numbers of CD14hiCCR2+CX3CR1+ monocytes. These findings suggest that certain subsets of monocytes may play a role in the control of malaria parasites and highlight the importance of understanding the complex relationships between the phenotype and function of monocytes in malaria infections.
Our study provides the first evidence that Schistosoma mansoni infection is associated with increased numbers of HIV-target cells, both in the blood and foreskin, of men at high risk for HIV acquisition in Uganda. These findings suggest that S. mansoni infection may increase the likelihood of HIV acquisition in this population. However, we did not find evidence of increased HIV infection in the foreskin of men with S. mansoni infection. The findings from this study highlight the need for more research on the interaction between helminth infections and HIV susceptibility in real-time, at the site of sexual exposure. This is particularly important in regions where both HIV and helminth infections are common, such as sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the potential role of S. mansoni infection in increasing HIV acquisition could inform public health strategies for reducing HIV incidence in these regions.
The parasite Wolbachia lives inside a variety of insects and other invertebrates, but it is particularly common in mosquitoes. Researchers have found that if they remove Wolbachia from mosquitoes, the mosquitoes are no longer able to carry malaria parasites. In this study, researchers studied the effects of removing Wolbachia on the cells of the mosquitoes themselves. They found that there was a lot of cell death in the adult mosquitoes, and in their eggs and larvae, after the Wolbachia were removed. This suggests that the Wolbachia are involved in controlling cell death in the mosquitoes, and that this may be one of the ways that they help to control malaria.
The study identifies mutations in the pantothenate kinase 1 gene of Plasmodium falciparum that confer resistance to pantothenate analogues, a new class of antiplasmodial compounds. The study highlights the importance of the conversion of pantothenate to CoA in the metabolism of the malaria parasite and shows that PanOH and CJ-15 , 801 can target different steps in the pantothenate biosynthetic pathway. The study also emphasizes the role of the Pfpank1 gene in the metabolism of pantothenate and the importance of the structure of the PanK enzyme in determining its susceptibility to inhibition by different compounds.
The PR interval is a measure of how long it takes for the heart to go from one beat to the next, and it is important for understanding the electrical activity of the heart. Researchers from four studies with a total of 6,247 African Americans have looked at the genetic variants associated with PR interval. They used a special kind of microarray to find genetic variants and then used statistical analysis to determine which ones were most strongly associated with PR interval. They found that a variant in the gene that encodes the cardiac sodium channel (SCN5A) was strongly associated with PR interval in two of the four cohorts, and in the combined analysis. This variant explained 2% of the variability in PR interval. The researchers also looked at whether genetic ancestry was associated with PR interval and found that African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration in one of the cohorts. They also found genetic variants associated with PR interval in European and Asian populations in a previous study, and found that one of these variants was associated with PR interval in African Americans. Overall, the results suggest that common genetic variants are associated with PR interval in African Americans and could potentially lead to a better understanding of the molecular electrophysiology of the heart, and even new drug targets for arrhythmia treatment.
This study describes a biochemical analysis of tobacco mosaic virus (ToMV) RNA replication. The authors showed that the tobacco mosaic virus (ToMV) 180K protein interacted with a small GTPase protein, ARL8, during RNA replication. They also showed that ARL8 and TOM1 played crucial roles in the process toward activation of the replication proteins' essential functions. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of ToMV RNA replication.
In the present study, the authors have developed two mathematical models of the olfactory system of the locust to investigate the effects of feedforward and feedback inhibitory connections on network dynamics. They found that feedforward inhibition was able to completely block the firing of downstream neurons, while feedback inhibition allowed for a delay in the onset of inhibition and produced oscillations in the firing of neurons. The authors conclude that their results provide a possible way to probe the connectivity structures of unexplored biological circuits.
Rabies is a deadly disease caused by the bite of an infected animal. It is important to diagnose rabies quickly in order to provide appropriate treatment and prevent the disease from spreading. The current gold standard for rabies diagnosis is the fluorescent antibody test (FAT), but this test is time-consuming and not suitable for use in the field. Molecular tests, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), have the potential to provide a faster and more accurate diagnosis, but have not yet been validated for use with all animal and human samples. In this study, we developed a one-step, real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay that is able to detect a large panel of animal and human samples infected with all known species of the Lyssavirus genus. This assay, which includes a pan-RABV RT-qPCR probe-based technique that is able to detect all representatives of the broad genetic diversity of RABV, and a SYBR Green RT-qPCR assay that can detect all the other lyssaviruses tested, was found to have high sensitivity and specificity and was able to detect a large panel of animal lyssavirus samples. It also provided accurate post-mortem or intra-vitam diagnoses of human rabies. The pan-RABV RT-qPCR was then evaluated in two national reference laboratories in enzootic countries, where its utility and efficacy for rabies diagnosis and surveillance were demonstrated. This combo RT-qPCR dedicated to pan-lyssavirus detection assay is a promising tool for the diagnosis of rabies, and could replace the current diagnostic methods in the future.
This study looked at a way to protect pigs from a disease caused by a parasite that is spread by tsetse flies in Ghana. The disease, called African animal trypanosomiasis, can cause pigs to become very sick and even die. To protect the pigs, the study used insecticide-treated mosquito fences that are attached to poles and planks around the pigsties. These fences are designed to kill tsetse flies that try to enter the pigsty. The study found that the insecticide-treated mosquito fences were very effective in reducing the number of tsetse flies that entered the pigsty and protecting the pigs from getting sick.
The study aimed to evaluate the status of reproducibility and transparency in biomedical research. To do so, a random sample of 441 biomedical journal articles published between 2000 and 2014 was analyzed for various indicators such as the provision of a protocol, sharing of raw data, replication studies, reporting of conflicts of interest, and sources of public and/or private funding. Only one study provided a full protocol, none made all raw data directly available, replication studies were rare, and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention anything about funding or conflicts of interest. The percentage of articles with no statement of conflict decreased substantially between 2000 and 2014. The study provides a baseline for assessing the progress of reproducibility and transparency in biomedical research.
The article describes the progression of pneumonic plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, and the roles of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in this process. The authors use a genetically modified strain of Y. pestis that expresses a YopE-TEM β-lactamase hybrid protein to identify the host cells targeted in the lung and to evaluate the effect of depletion of these cell types on the progression of pneumonic plague. They show that Y. pestis targets alveolar macrophages and neutrophils early during infection, and that neutrophils are ultimately responsible for the severe inflammation during the pro-inflammatory phase. This work gives insight into the dynamic events occurring shortly after pulmonary exposure to the highly lethal pathogen Y. pestis.
A study was conducted to evaluate the performance of serological tests to identify asymptomatic infections with Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) in a cohort of individuals from an area with active L. infantum transmission. The study included 136 participants, 97 of whom were positive for L. infantum infection, as determined by molecular biology tests in 1999, and 39 who were negative for L. infantum infection. The participants were clinically examined and none had progressed to disease from their asymptomatic state. The study aimed to compare the sensitivity and specificity of serological tests, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using L. infantum and L. amazonensis crude antigens and recombinant protein rK39, to the reference standard of molecular biology tests. The study found that rK39 had higher specificity than the other antigens tested, but lower sensitivity. The study also found that there was low agreement among the different antigens used. The results of the study suggest that serological tests may have low accuracy for diagnosing asymptomatic infections with L. infantum compared to molecular biology tests. This highlights the importance of using molecular biology tests as the reference standard for diagnosing asymptomatic infections with L. infantum in population studies.
We have developed a computational approach for identifying genome-wide changes in expression of repetitive elements in ES cells and germ cells . Using this approach we show that many repeats are silenced by different mechanisms in ES cells and germ cells. We find that different copies of repeats can be differentially targeted by DNA methylation and Hdac1 in ES cells, and that this can affect the silencing of the repeats. We also identify a small number of repeats that are specifically silenced by Hdac1 in ES cells. Our work provides evidence for the existence of modular mechanisms for the silencing of repetitive elements in ES cells and germ cells, and demonstrates that many repeats are silenced independently of one another. The results from this study should provide a starting point for further investigating the mechanisms involved in repetitive element silencing in ES cells and germ cells.
The Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) is a photoreceptor that mediates blue light-dependent flowering. In the laboratory, the CRY2 protein was found to interact with at least three CIB (CIB1, CIB2, and CIB5) bHLH proteins. These CIB proteins were found to bind to the promoters of genes involved in flowering. The binding of CIBs to the promoters of flowering genes was found to be higher in the presence of blue light than in the absence of light, suggesting that CRY2-CIBs mediate blue light-dependent flowering. The CRY2-CIBs complex was also found to be involved in the regulation of photoperiod-dependent flowering. The genetic analysis of CIBs showed that they acted redundantly to regulate the transcription of the flowering gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). It was found that CIBs interacted with each other to form heterodimers that bound to the non-canonical E-box elements of the FT promoter. The study also found that CIBs were specifically involved in CRY2 signaling and that their expression was regulated specifically by blue light. The findings suggest that the CRY2-CIBs complex is involved in the regulation of blue light-dependent and photoperiod-dependent flowering.
Many refugees coming to the United States come from countries where certain intestinal parasites are common. These parasites are rare in the United States and may be misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all, potentially leading to serious consequences. This study aimed to evaluate the costs and benefits of different programs for treating these parasites in refugees. The programs included no treatment, domestic screening and treatment, and overseas presumptive treatment. The study used a model to estimate the costs and health impacts of each program on an annual cohort of 27,700 U.S.-bound Asian refugees. The "No Program" option was the least expensive, but also the least effective, resulting in 145 outpatient cases, 4.0 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths discounted over a 60-year period for a one-year cohort. The "Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin" option was less expensive than "Domestic Screening and Treatment" or "Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides" and was found to be the most effective. The study found that overseas presumptive treatment for U.S.-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs. The addition of ivermectin to albendazole was found to reduce the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis and the probability of rare, but potentially fatal, disseminated strongyloidiasis.
In this study, we identified a new species of microsporidian, Nematocida displodere, which infects a wide variety of tissues and cell types in Caenorhabditis elegans, including the intestine, epidermis, muscle, neurons, and coelomocytes. This new species is distinct from the previously identified species N. parisii and N. sp . 1, which only infect the intestine. N. displodere has a unique life cycle, with initial infection occurring throughout the animal, but subsequent development of spores occurring primarily in the muscle and neurons. The unique tissue tropism of N. displodere is likely due to its large genome, which encodes an enormous number of unknown RING-domain containing proteins. Our study highlights the importance of considering the life cycle of microsporidians within specific tissues when studying the host-pathogen interaction.
In this study, researchers have shown that the Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) protein is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that can reposition nucleosomes. The study has identified new binding partners for CSB, NAP1-like histone chaperones, and demonstrated that their combined activities are essential for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. The research provides new insights into the functions of CSB in transcription-coupled DNA repair and the underlying mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome.
Understanding the causes and consequences of genomic variation is a major goal in the field of genetics. Variations in DNA methylation are known to occur among humans, but a detailed map of these variations has not been previously described. Here, the authors used population data derived from five different human cell types to identify highly variable DNA methylation regions (VMRs) and to explore the causes and consequences of these variations. They identified over 10,000 VMRs and found that they are enriched for CpGs that influence gene expression and for transcription factor binding sites. The authors also found evidence that VMRs form cis and trans co-regulated networks that are enriched for genes with cell-type relevant functions. Finally, the authors experimentally demonstrated environmental effects on methylation at VMRs using cultured fibroblasts, revealing signatures that overlap those observed in their population-level datasets. Overall, this study provides novel insights into the biology of variable methylation across the human genome.
The paper describes a new dengue NS1 detection test, the Dengue Early Rapid, which has been evaluated in retrospective studies at two separate sites in Southeast Asia. The test was evaluated alone and in combination with a dengue IgM and IgG rapid test. The Dengue Early Rapid was found to have a sensitivity of 69.2% and a specificity of 96% at the Vietnam study site, and a sensitivity of 68.9% and specificity of 96.7% at the Malaysia study site. The Dengue Early Rapid in combination with the Dengue Duo Cassette had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 98.6% at the Vietnam study site, and a sensitivity of 91.9% and a specificity of 98.7% at the Malaysia study site. The study highlights that the use of dengue NS1 detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG serology can significantly increase the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and extends the possible window of detection to include very early acute samples.
The manuscript describes a novel computational method, Transat, for predicting RNA structure and co-transcriptional folding pathways. Transat uses a novel approach to identify conserved helices of high statistical significance and is able to detect RNA structures that are known references and those of known alternative structural configurations. Transat can also identify unstructured sub-sequences bound by other molecules and provides evidence for new helices that may define folding pathways. The manuscript provides a comprehensive performance evaluation of Transat and shows that the structural features predicted by Transat differ from those assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. The manuscript also discusses the limitations of existing methods for predicting RNA folding pathways and how Transat addresses these limitations.
Plant immunity helps plants fight off bacteria and viruses. The immune system is made up of different parts that work together. When one part of the system is disabled, other parts of the system can help it work again. This is called buffering. By studying how the different parts of the system work together, we can better understand how the immune system works. We used a special way of studying the immune system in plants that helps us understand how the different parts work together. We found that many of the interactions between different parts of the system were not found when we used the traditional method of studying individual parts of the system. We also found that some parts of the system were more important than others. Overall, our study shows that the plant immune system is much more complex than we thought, and that there are many ways that the different parts of the system work together to keep the plant safe.
In Drosophila, the central nervous system is made up of two types of cells: neurons and glial cells. These two cell types are produced from neuroepithelial cells, which form a sheet of cells in the head ectoderm. During embryogenesis, this sheet of cells is patterned to form the optic placode, which gives rise to the larval eye primordium and optic lobe primordium. The larval eye primordium produces photoreceptor neurons, while the optic lobe primordium gives rise to ganglion cells and interneurons. To do this, the neuroepithelial cells are divided into two domains: a ventroposterior domain, which produces larval eye precursors, and a dorsal domain, which produces optic lobe precursors. The factors atonal (ato) and tailless (tll) are important for this patterning process. Ato is expressed in the ventroposterior domain, where it promotes the production of larval eye precursors, while tll is expressed in the dorsal domain, where it promotes the production of optic lobe precursors.
In this study, the authors present their findings on the net-like structures formed by hBD1ox, a reduced form of human β-defensin-1, on the surface of Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. epidermidis bacteria. They also investigate the mechanism behind these structures and their antimicrobial activity.
This paper investigates the role of the protein OCRL1 in the endocytosis process in the zebrafish pronephric tubule, which is a model for the mammalian renal tubule. OCRL1 is an inositol 5-phosphatase that preferentially hydrolyses PtdIns (4,5)P2, although it also displays activity towards PtdIns (3,4,5)P3. The authors generated a zebrafish model with a retroviral insertion in the OCRL1 locus to stably attenuate gene expression and observed that endocytosis within the pronephros is impaired. They also observed reduced levels of the multi-ligand receptor megalin, mislocalization of megalin in the endocytic pathway, and altered morphology and abundance of endocytic compartments. These effects are not due to ciliary defects, and cell polarity is normal in the zebrafish model. The authors propose that OCRL1 is required for efficient endocytosis in vivo, and that endocytic defects are responsible for the renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease. They also suggest that PIP5K could be a potential therapeutic target for these disorders.
This article is about a study that looked at the prevalence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in cattle, goats, and sheep in an area of Tanzania that experiences seasonal flooding. RVF is a mosquito-borne virus that can affect humans and animals. The study used blood samples from livestock to test for the presence of antibodies against RVF virus, which indicates that the animal has had contact with the virus in the past. The study found that 11.3% of the animals tested were seropositive, meaning that they had been exposed to the virus. The study also looked at other factors, such as the age and species of the animal, that may be associated with being seropositive. Finally, the study used geographic information system (GIS) techniques to map the seropositive cases and identify potential areas for future monitoring. Overall, the study provides important information about the prevalence of RVF in this region of Tanzania and highlights the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of the disease.
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected tropical disease that affects over six million people worldwide. Despite its high prevalence, there are currently no vaccines or curative treatments available. This review summarizes recent findings regarding the use of a contractile vacuole (CV) for parasite entry in epimastigotes and trypomastigotes of T. cruzi. The authors highlight the importance of the CV for parasite entry and survival, and provide examples of how this process can be targeted for the development of new drugs and vaccines. The authors also discuss the potential for using host-derived molecules, such as heparin and heparin-like molecules, to disrupt the CV and prevent parasite entry. Overall, this review provides a useful overview of the current state of research on the CV of T. cruzi and its importance for parasite entry and survival.
This study compared the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick embryo cell rabies vaccine administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen , compared with the currently recommended 2-site/Thai Red Cross ( TRC ) regimen . The study enrolled healthy individuals aged 1 year of age or older and randomized them into 4 groups to receive intradermal PCECV according to either the 4-site/1-week regimen or the 2-site/TRC regimen, with or without human rabies immunoglobulin ( HRIG ) administration. The study found that the 4-site/1-week regimen was non-inferior to the 2-site/TRC regimen in terms of immune response, as measured by the percentage of participants with rabies virus neutralizing antibody ( RVNA ) concentrations ≥0.5 international units ( IU ) /mL and RVNA geometric mean concentrations ( GMCs ) at D49. The study also found that the 4-site/1-week regimen was safe and well-tolerated, with no significant differences in solicited and unsolicited adverse events between the 2 regimens. The study concluded that the 4-site/1-week regimen might be an alternative to current recommendations, with potential benefits in terms of improved cost-efficiency and compliance to vaccination.
The article describes a study of the dynamic functional connectivity of the salience network, which is a brain network involved in detecting and responding to salient events. The study used data from 78 participants in the Human Connectome Project and applied novel graph-theoretical techniques to investigate the spatiotemporal organization of the salience network. The results showed that the salience network has distinct features that are behaviorally significant, including high temporal flexibility and spatiotemporal diversity. Furthermore, the temporal flexibility of the salience network was found to predict individual differences in cognitive flexibility. The study used cross-validation techniques to test the reliability and robustness of the findings. Overall, the study provides new insights into the dynamic functional connectivity of the salience network and its relationship to cognitive flexibility.
The study aimed to understand the mechanism of the non-enveloped virus, simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40). The authors discovered a new protein, VP4, which was found to be associated with the last stage of the viral life cycle, the release of the viral progeny from the host cell. The authors investigated the ability of VP4 to bind and disrupt lipid membranes, and found that it efficiently bound red blood cell (RBC) membranes and supported membrane perforation. The study also showed that VP4 disrupted liposomes mimicking the composition of mammalian plasma and nuclear membranes. Deleting or substituting the hydrophobic domain of VP4 drastically abolished its membrane disruptive activity, indicating a role for the hydrophobic domain in membrane lysis. The authors propose that VP4 plays a central role in the direct disruption of cellular membranes to trigger SV40 viral release.
Dengue virus infection poses a major health threat worldwide. Although the development of an effective antiviral drug is a priority, it is challenging to achieve. Instead, researchers have been focusing on vaccines as a promising strategy. Recently, a DNA vaccine encoding the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) from DENV2 has been reported to be protective against infection in mice. Here, the authors investigate the protective immunity induced by this DNA vaccine. They found that the vaccine provides robust protection against DENV infection in mice, which is in part characterized by anti-NS1-specific antibodies and T cells responses. They also demonstrated the critical role of CD4+ T cells and the humoral response in the protection against DENV mediated by the NS1 antigen. These findings provide new insights on the immunity elicited by DENV NS1 antigen and on a prospect for vaccine development.
The present study investigates the mechanism of trans-signalling peptide control of the comRS system in Streptococcus thermophilus by characterizing the three-dimensional structure of the apo and complexed forms of the ComR transcriptional activator. Through complementary approaches of X-ray crystallography, isothermal titration calorimetry, and size exclusion chromatography, the authors showed that ComR binds to XIP and DNA in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:1, forming a stable trimeric complex. The study also provided evidence for the existence of a second binding site in ComR, which can accommodate an additional XIP molecule. These findings suggest that XIP plays an essential role in ComR stabilization and provide new insights into the signalling peptide-mediated control of the comRS system in S. thermophilus.
In this study, the authors investigated the functional properties of the protein ELIC by electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography. ELIC is a member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) family, which includes cation selective serotonin and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. ELIC has a non-conducting conformation, which is also observed in its resting state in other pLGICs. However, the protein is expected to belong to the same group of cation selective channels as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor based on sequence similarity and an initial functional characterization. The authors identified a class of primary amines that open the ELIC channel, and they found that the open channel conductance and the comparably simple functional behavior make ELIC an attractive model system for studying general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors.
The study is about allergies, specifically the connection between skin allergies and asthma. The authors found that mice with skin allergies and defects in their skin barrier are also prone to developing asthma. They also identified a protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) as a key player in this connection, as it is produced by skin cells in response to skin allergies and can trigger allergies in the lungs. The authors used a mouse model to show that blocking TSLP signaling in mice with skin allergies and defects prevented them from developing asthma. This finding suggests that TSLP may be a potential therapeutic target for preventing asthma in people with skin allergies.
The provided content is a scientific paper that describes the characterization of the genome and transcriptome of the bacterium Thermotoga maritima. The authors used a variety of omics approaches, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics, to gain a better understanding of the bacterium's genome and its regulation. They identified a number of new functional RNA transcripts and promoter elements, as well as new non-coding RNAs. They also developed a new computational approach for the analysis of omics data, which they used to identify novel transcriptional start sites and promoter motifs. Overall, the paper provides a detailed characterization of the T. maritima genome and transcriptome, which will be valuable for understanding the bacterium's biology and for developing new applications in biotechnology and medicine.
We studied how visual contexts influence perception of a target object by presenting observers with stimuli consisting of one or more bars and asking them to report whether they perceived a target bar or not. We found that contextual effects were strongest when no target contrast was present and disappeared when target contrast was present. We modeled these effects using Bayesian inference and found that our model well fit the data. The results suggest that the neural substrates responsible for the contextual effects are likely beyond the primary visual cortex.
Cooperation is a common trait observed in many species, but it is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors who take advantage of the common good without contributing fairly. Despite this, cooperation can survive in some cases. Researchers have found that small population sizes can actually be beneficial for cooperation because they increase variability in cooperator frequency and favor the growth of cooperator-dominated locations. The authors used computer simulations to investigate this phenomenon and found that there are three mechanisms through which defectors can sometimes be helpful for cooperation. During defector-induced population collapse, defectors can go extinct before cooperators by chance, allowing cooperators to grow. Empty locations created by defector-induced population extinction can favor cooperation because they allow cooperator but not defector migrants to grow. Mutations adaptive to resource limitation can also be selected for in a structured population, and when these mutations are initially present at low levels or continuously generated at a moderate rate, they can further reduce local population size and favor cooperation. The authors suggest that these mechanisms provide a "built-in" mechanism for the persistence of cooperation in structured populations.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterium that can cause infections in people with weakened immune systems. The researchers in this study found that P. aeruginosa binds specifically to sites of multicellular junctions on epithelial cells. These junctions are formed by multiple cells and are important for maintaining the integrity of the epithelium. The researchers also found that P. aeruginosa can be taken up by surrounding epithelial cells through a process called efferocytosis, which involves the clearance of apoptotic cells. Once inside the epithelial cells, P. aeruginosa is found in an efferocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features. After 24 hours, the bacteria are eliminated. These findings could be relevant for understanding the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease in which P. aeruginosa is a major pathogen.
In Drosophila, the embryonic gonad develops from two types of cells, the primordial germ cells (PGCs) and the somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs). PGCs form at the posterior of the blastoderm stage of embryos and are subsequently carried inside the embryo during gastrulation to reach the SGPs. To reach the SGPs, PGCs must traverse the midgut wall and then migrate through the mesoderm. A combination of local repulsive cues and attractive signals emanating from the SGPs guide PGC migration. The hedgehog (hh) pathway gene shf plays a role in directing PGC migration. Shf encodes a secreted protein that facilitates the long-distance transmission of Hh through the proteoglycan matrix. Shf is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm, and loss- and gain-of-function experiments demonstrate that it is required for PGC migration. Previous studies have established that the hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway plays a pivotal role in generating the PGC attractant both by the SGPs and by other tissues when hmgcr is ectopically expressed. In this study, the authors show that production of the PGC attractant depends upon shf as well as a second hh pathway gene, gγ1. Furthermore, the authors present evidence indicating that ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release/transmission of the Hh ligand from these cells into and through the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. Finally, the authors show that potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend upon cholesterol modification.
This study examines the HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic capacity of HIV-1-uninfected recipients of the Merck Ad5/HIV trivalent vaccine. The authors found that vaccine recipients exhibited proliferative capacity and upregulated perforin expression in CD8+ T-cells that overlapped with those of LTNP. However, the ability of these cells to kill primary autologous HIV-infected targets was relatively low and comparable to that of progressors. This low cytotoxic capacity was not related to precursor or effector cell frequencies. Although this cytotoxic capacity was modest in most vaccinees, the highest responses were observed in those with the protective HLA class I alleles B*57 , B*58 and B*27 . Taken together these data suggest that the Merck Ad5/HIV trivalent vaccine induced relatively modest cytotoxic capacity against HIV-1-infected cells in vaccinees. In addition, they suggest that protective HLA class I alleles have an effect on the cytotoxic capacity induced by vaccination that is mediated during T-cell priming.
In this study, the authors use mathematical models to explore the relationship between jointly intentional behavior and technological advancement. They find that rapid technological advance goes hand-in-hand with the emergence of the ability to participate in jointly intentional behavior. Conversely, in the absence of opportunities for significant technological improvement, the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is selected against. The authors suggest that this mechanism provides a unified explanation for the suppression or emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a possible cause of inter-species diversity in the prevalence of such behavior.
In this study, the authors identified two specific microRNAs, miR-34b and miR-449, which are crucial for spermatogenesis in mice. They generated knockout mice for these microRNAs and found that the loss of these microRNAs resulted in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count, motility and morphology. They also found that these microRNAs are specifically expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells and that they regulate the expression of genes involved in spermatogenesis. This study provides the first evidence that microRNAs play an important role in spermatogenesis.
Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is a commensal bacterium that has been used to treat a variety of conditions for over a century. It is known to produce two microcins (H47 and M), which exhibit antibacterial activity against a broad range of bacteria. The authors aimed to understand the mechanism of action of these microcins and to identify potential targets for their improvement. They found that the peptidase activity of ClbP, a protein that is part of the colibactin biosynthesis pathway, is required for the antibacterial activity of MccH47 and MccM. They also demonstrated that the colibactin biosynthesis pathway is intimately connected to the production of the siderophore enterobactin, which is required for the production of MccH47 and MccM. Finally, they showed that the S95R mutation of ClbP leads to the loss of ClbP peptidase activity and also to a loss of genotoxicity in vitro. These findings provide important insights into the mechanism of action of MccH47 and MccM and may help to improve their efficacy.
In this manuscript, the authors describe a series of analyses aimed at elucidating the role of the N-acyltransferase UXT1 in the synthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and the pathogenesis of cryptococcosis. UXT1 is an essential gene for the survival of Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungal pathogen that can cause life-threatening disease in humans and animals. UXT1 is responsible for the transfer of a fatty acyl moiety from cofactor UDP-acyl to the hydroxyl group of GSL precursors. The authors first identify UXT1 as a member of a family of N-acyltransferases with a conserved sequence and domain structure that are found in fungi, plants, and animals. They then demonstrate that UXT1 is required for the synthesis of several classes of GSLs in C. neoformans. Using metabolomics and enzymatic analysis, the authors show that UXT1 is responsible for the synthesis of the major class of GSLs, the ceramides. They also demonstrate that UXT1 is required for the synthesis of a second class of GSLs, the sphingomyelins, as well as a third class, the sphingosines. The authors then use gene knockout and complementation experiments to demonstrate that UXT1 is essential for the survival of C. neoformans in vitro and in vivo. They show that UXT1 is required for growth on various carbon sources, including glucose, galactose, and fatty acids. They also show that UXT1 is required for virulence in a murine model of cryptococcosis, with knockout strains having reduced survival and growth in the lungs of infected mice. Finally, the authors use gene expression analysis to show that UXT1 is required for the synthesis of several enzymes involved in GSL biosynthesis, suggesting a role for UXT1 in regulating GSL metabolism. Overall, these data provide important insights into the function of UXT1 in C. neoformans and suggest that UXT1 may be a valuable target for the development of antifungal drugs.
This article describes the steps taken to develop a database for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The authors conducted a systematic review of the literature, including peer-reviewed journals and "grey" literature, to obtain prevalence data on schistosomiasis in Africa. They then georeferenced the locations and entered the data into a MySQL database with a web interface. The authors plan to expand the database to include other NTDs and to make it publicly available.
The study investigated the impact of chronic helminth infections on the course of tuberculosis (TB) infection. The researchers used the cotton rat model to test their hypothesis that chronic helminth infections exacerbate TB infections. They measured immune responses, lung granuloma size and bacterial load in the spleen and lungs of cotton rats infected with Litomosoides sigmodontis (a filarial nematode) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). They found that chronic filaria infections did not increase the risk for MTB infection or the size of lung granulomas. However, they noted that the immune responses to MTB and helminth antigens were altered in co-infected animals. The findings suggest that chronic helminth infections do not worsen MTB infection, but alter the immune response to the bacteria.
Insects use a variety of ion channels to detect their environment and control behaviors like feeding, courtship, and avoiding threats. Scientists have found that a specific type of ion channel, called ppk23, is found in a subpopulation of gustatory-like bristles on male flies. These bristles are different from those that express feeding-related gustatory receptors. Disrupting ppk23 or inhibiting activity of ppk23-expressing neurons did not affect gustatory responses, but instead delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship. Additionally, mutations in ppk23 altered the behavioral response of males to a female-specific aphrodisiac. These data indicate that ppk23 and the cells expressing it play an important role in the peripheral sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Drosophila.
This research is about the relationship between the mitochondrial DNA of a type of alga called Chlamydomonas and its mitochondrial tRNAs, which are small molecules that help the cell translate its DNA. The researchers have discovered that the levels of mitochondrial tRNAs are fixed and cannot be regulated in response to a novel genetic context. This suggests that the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs in mitochondria result from a co-evolutive adaptation between the tRNA import mechanism and the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery. The researchers have also found that the mitochondrial tRNA import is not dynamic but rather fixed during evolution to meet the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery. Overall, the researchers have provided important insights into the regulation of mitochondrial tRNA import and its impact on the mitochondrial translation machinery.
The paper describes a study that used a method called continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to evaluate the frequency and types of glucose dysregulation in diabetes and prediabetes. The authors found that glucose dysregulation is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought and can affect individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures. They also developed an analytical framework that can group individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses called "glucotypes" that reveal heterogeneity within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. The authors built a webtool for visualizing a user-uploaded CGM profile and classifying individualized glucose patterns into glucotypes. They also found that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability using CGM, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. They concluded that the interindividual variability in glycemic responses to standardized meals highlights the personal nature of glucose regulation and that specific patterns of glycemic responses reflect variable underlying physiology.
The study shows that EDR1 negatively regulates the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade in Arabidopsis. EDR1 is a Raf-like MAPKKK kinase and is a negative regulator of plant defense and cell death. The study found that edr1 mutants have highly activated MPK3/MPK6 kinase activity and higher levels of MPK3/MPK6 proteins than wild type, and that EDR1 physically interacts with MKK4 and MKK5. The study also found that EDR1 negatively affects MKK4/MKK5 protein levels and that the mpk3 , mkk4 and mkk5 mutations suppress edr1-mediated resistance. The study suggests that EDR1 functions as a negative regulator of the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade to fine-tune plant innate immunity.
The study describes a method for predicting infectious disease cases. It uses a computational framework based on Gaussian processes, which can capture highly complex relationships between input and output variables. The framework is tested on a dataset of Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever cases in Turkey, which is a vector-borne infectious disease. The researchers found that their method outperformed two standard machine learning algorithms (random forests and boosted regression trees) in both spatial and spatiotemporal prediction scenarios. This means that their method could help public health policy makers make better decisions and save lives. The study also provides an overview of the computational framework, which is illustrated in a figure.
Rift Valley Fever (RVFV) is a zoonotic disease that poses a threat to public health and livestock in Africa. In this study, we used a mathematical model to explore the impact of human activities, such as the livestock importation and transportation associated with the annual Muslim festival, on the spread and outbreak of RVFV. The disease model was developed using a SEIRS structure for livestock and a SEI model for vectors. The seasonal variations in the abundance of mosquitoes were modeled as a function of the rainfall level, which is periodic with a yearly cycle. We extended the model to a three-patch model by considering human activities as periodic parameters. We conducted numerical simulations and found that the importation and transportation of livestock during the annual festival can accelerate the spread and outbreak of RVFV. Our results provide evidence for the need to implement effective control strategies to prevent the spread of RVFV during the festival season.
In this study, we analyzed the historical distribution of human anthrax in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010, and compared the incidence rates of the disease during three time periods: Soviet governance, post-Soviet governance before a nationally sponsored preemptive livestock vaccination program, and after the preemptive livestock vaccination campaign. We found that the annual incidence rate of human anthrax increased from 1984 to 1995, with a sharp decline in incidence from 1996 to 2010. Additionally, we identified geographic variation in the spatial distribution of anthrax cases, with cases primarily concentrated in the west early in the study period and shifted eastward as time progressed. Our findings highlight the need for an integrated “One Health” approach that takes into account the changing geographic distribution of the disease.
In this study, the authors used molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and a Shaker KV channel in both an open and closed state. The simulations revealed a potential PUFA binding site located in the lipid-facing part of the S3-S4 pocket, which is in agreement with experimental data. The authors also found that the PUFA tail interacted with the extracellular halves of the VSD helices S3 and S4, while the carboxylic head group formed fewer and more specific interactions with the S3-S4 linker and the S3-S4 top regions. In addition, the simulations showed that saturated fatty acids (SFAs) interacted with the channel in a similar manner to PUFAs but with fewer and weaker interactions. The results provide insights into the specificity of PUFA-channel interactions and may aid in the design of new pharmaceutical compounds for the treatment of epilepsy.
Cryptosporidium parvum is a parasitic protozoan that causes diarrhea and other intestinal illnesses. In the absence of a reliable method for testing drugs, new drug discovery efforts are hampered. We report the development of a pipeline for testing drugs against C . parvum. The pipeline includes genetically engineered parasites, host cell lines, and high-content imaging and cell sorting techniques. We used this pipeline to screen compounds and discovered several that have promising anti-cryptosporidial activity. These findings will facilitate drug discovery efforts against C . parvum.
This paper is about finding the genetic causes of problems with tooth development. The authors did a study using information from two different groups of people in Finland and England. They looked at the time it takes for a tooth to erupt and the number of teeth at one year old. They found 5 genes that were linked to these problems with tooth development. They also found that certain versions of these genes are linked to problems that need orthodontic treatment. These findings are important because they will help us understand why some people have problems with their teeth and how to help them.
This study investigates the behavior and physiology of mice with an extra or missing copy of a region of chromosome 16 (Hspa13-App) that is similar to a portion of human chromosome 21. The authors use a novel mouse model with an extra copy of the Hspa13-App region and a corresponding mouse model with a missing copy of the region. They find that the extra copy of the region causes an overgrowth of the muscles, while the missing copy causes a decrease in muscle size. They also find that the extra copy of the region causes an increase in the amount of mitochondria in the muscles, while the missing copy causes a decrease in the amount of mitochondria in the muscles. The authors conclude that the Hspa13-App region is important for the normal development of muscles and that the region may play a role in regulating the amount of mitochondria in cells.
In this article, we present a mathematical model for the coupling of basal and agonist-evoked currents of GIRK1/2 potassium channels. We demonstrate that GIRK1/2 channels, which are inhibited by Gβγ, show an inverse relation between basal and evoked currents, which we term "priming" by Gαi/o". We explain this relation by calculating the apparent molar ratios of Gα and Gβγ available for GIRK channels. Our results indicate a significant extent of association between GIRK1/2 and Gβγ, which supports the notion that Gα is a non-obligatory partner in the GIRK-G protein signaling complex. We suggest that the inverse relation between basal and evoked currents, as well as the increased availability of Gβγ with increasing surface density of GIRK1/2, result from the recruitment of Gβγ by GIRK1 to the PM. We show that this recruitment is controlled by the Gα subunit, which may serve as a "buffer" for the GIRK-G protein signaling complex.
This paper presents a method for predicting TALE target boxes in Oryza sativa using machine learning, specifically the TALE binding site model. The model was trained using a large set of TALE sequences and annotated O. sativa target boxes, and it uses a sliding window approach to scan promoter sequences of O. sativa genes for potential TALE target boxes. The model is implemented using the Jstacs library and is available as a web-application. The paper also describes the tool DerTALE, which uses the trained model to predict differentially expressed regions around a putative target box and provides a profile output. The authors test the method on promoter sequences of O. sativa genes up-regulated after Xanthomonas oryzae infection and compare its performance to established tools for TALE target site prediction. They also test the method on promoter sequences of five other plant species.
The paper describes the development of a new machine learning algorithm called APOGEE for predicting the pathogenicity of non-synonymous mitochondrial DNA variants. The algorithm was trained and tested on a large dataset of 1,532 variants, including 223 pathogenic and 5 non-pathogenic mitochondrial DNA variants, and 636 neutral variants. The algorithm was compared to other existing prediction methods and found to outperform them in terms of accuracy. The paper also describes the methods used to build and train the algorithm, as well as the performance metrics used to evaluate its accuracy.
Dengue virus causes a severe flu-like illness and leads to a potentially life-threatening condition called dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. During the past few decades, dengue fever has become a major public health problem worldwide. There are four different serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1 to -4), and patients can experience multiple episodes of dengue fever caused by different serotypes. In this study, we found that dengue virus, as well as Zika virus, can induce platelet aggregation, which is essential for hemostasis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. Using a dengue-infected patient-derived serum sample, we found that dengue virus NS1 is a major platelet aggregation enhancer. Furthermore, we found that TLR4 is a receptor for dengue virus NS1, and that dengue virus NS1 induces platelet aggregation through the TLR4/MyD88/TRAF6/NF-κB signaling pathway. These findings suggest that NS1 might be a therapeutic target for preventing dengue fever and other flaviviral diseases.
The article "Mathematical Analysis of the Dynamic Control System of the Arginase-Vasopressin System" presents a mathematical model of the arginase-vasopressin system, which regulates blood pressure and water balance in the body. The model is based on a system of differential equations that describe the interactions between the various components of the system, such as the vasopressin receptors in the kidneys and the arginase enzyme in the liver. The model is then analyzed to determine the stability and behavior of the system under different conditions. Overall, the article provides a mathematical framework for understanding the complex interactions between the various components of the arginase-vasopressin system.
In this paper, the authors study the transport of proteins in fibrin networks using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Darcy's equation. They found that thrombin and Fab IgG solutes have different hydrodynamic diameters, which are in agreement with x-ray diffraction results. They also found that the permeability of the fibrin networks decreases as the fibrinogen concentration increases, and that the diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions of thrombin and Fab IgG vary depending on the fibrinogen concentration. The authors also developed a hemodynamics model to study the effect of the fibrin network on thrombin transport. Their results suggest that the fibrin network does not provide a diffusion barrier for thrombin, but it does limit the advection of thrombin and prevent resting platelets from approaching the thrombus core. The authors conclude that the fibrin network may play a role in limiting the growth of small thrombi.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the human immune system fights against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The researchers found that the immune system is able to control the growth of the bacterium by using a specific type of T cells, called invariant natural killer T cells, or iNKT cells. These iNKT cells are able to recognize and attack the bacteria directly, without the need for other immune cells or antibodies. The researchers believe that this discovery could lead to new treatments for tuberculosis that target these specific iNKT cells.
The article "Expression of the EFH1 gene in Candida albicans during infection" presents data on the expression of the EFH1 gene in C. albicans during infection of the mouse intestinal tract. EFH1 is a transcription factor that plays a role in the regulation of virulence genes in C. albicans. The authors used qRT-PCR and microarray analysis to determine the expression of EFH1 during infection of the mouse intestinal tract. They found that EFH1 is expressed at high levels during infection and that the expression is regulated by the environment of the intestinal tract. The authors also discuss the potential role of EFH1 in regulating the expression of other virulence genes in C. albicans. Overall, the article provides new insights into the regulation of virulence genes in C. albicans during infection.
Immunization with irradiated sporozoites is an effective way to prevent malaria infections. However, the exact mechanism behind this approach is not fully understood. Using TCR transgenic cells specific for the malaria circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the researchers found that CSP antigen persists for over 8 weeks after immunization. They also showed that CD11c+ cells play a crucial role in the persistence of CSP antigen. The researchers found that prolonged antigen presentation enhances the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response in several ways. Firstly, reducing the time primed CD8+ T cells were exposed to antigen in vivo severely reduced the final size of the developing memory population. Secondly, fully developed memory cells expanded in previously immunized mice but not when transferred to naïve animals. Finally, naïve cells were able to become functional effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in the liver. These findings suggest that the optimal development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages is dependent on the prolonged presentation of sporozoite-derived antigen.
We tested whether a drug delivery system made of nanoparticles could help treat leishmaniasis, a disease that causes ulcers on the skin. The drug delivery system was made by mixing a synthetic polymer and a drug called polymyxin B (polB). The nanoparticles were then tested in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that the nanoparticles were effective against both leishmaniasis and bacteria that cause secondary infections, making them a promising new treatment option.
The paper aims to identify the factors associated with death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, between 2002 and 2009. The authors used data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health's Reportable Disease Information System (SINAN) to identify risk factors for death from VL, including clinical manifestations, comorbidities, and demographic information. They developed a prognostic score using the factors identified in the final model, which was validated using data from 2007 to 2009. The paper provides valuable information about the clinical features associated with death from VL, which can be used to improve clinical management of patients and ultimately reduce mortality. The authors suggest that the prognostic score can help clinicians identify patients at high risk of death and provide them with appropriate care.
The lay summary of the provided content is: In this study, the authors investigate the differential regulation of the RD-kinase BRI1 and the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR by the RD-kinase BAK1. They identify a novel mutant allele of BAK1, bak1-5, that is strongly impaired in PTI signaling but displays a wild-type-like BR signaling capacity. Furthermore, bak1-5 is not impaired in cell death control. This unexpected phenotype is not due to a differential complex formation between BAK1 and the RD and non-RD kinases, but requires the kinase activity of BAK1. Moreover, our work reveals dramatic differences in the trans-phosphorylation events between BAK1 and BRI1 or EFR in vitro, and the requirement of kinase activity for complex formation in planta. These results suggest that BAK1, and possibly other RD-kinases, may act as signaling hubs in plant defense and may have distinct functions in RD and non-RD signaling pathways.
The paper presents a new approach to study the effects of anticancer treatment on proliferation at the cell population level. The authors combined time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometry data with a mathematical model to render the proliferative process over several cell generations during/after treatment. The model included modules for the functional activity of the main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase of the cell cycle. The authors also developed a computational tool to perform the analysis, and used it to study the effects of X-ray treatment on human ovarian cancer cells. The results showed that X-ray exposure caused G1 arrest and reduced cell proliferation in subsequent generations. The authors conclude that the new approach provides a powerful tool for studying the effects of anticancer treatment on proliferation at the cell population level, and that it has the potential to be used for the development of new treatments.
In this study, researchers investigated the effects of mitochondrial dysfunction on the development of kidney disease and kidney failure in humans. They focused specifically on the Pdss2 gene, which is important for the development of the mitochondrial apparatus, and its function in kidney cells. The researchers used a variety of methods, including genetic engineering and biochemical analysis, to study the effects of Pdss2 mutations on mitochondrial function, kidney development, and disease progression in both humans and mice. They found that Pdss2 mutations can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, which in turn can cause kidney disease and kidney failure. They also found that the severity of kidney disease and kidney failure depends on the type of Pdss2 mutation and its effect on mitochondrial function. These findings have important implications for understanding the causes of kidney disease and kidney failure and for developing new treatments and therapies for these conditions.
The study of developmental cell lineages in three invertebrates species reveals that determinative development leads to highly robust lineages against cell death and genetic perturbations. The lineages have a highly nonrandom structure that explains the robustness, which is unlikely to have evolved by chance. The study provides novel insights into how determinative development achieves robustness and how this mechanism may be advantageous for evolutionary adaptation.
EmbryoPhenomics is a high-throughput platform for studying the development of aquatic embryos using a custom-built video microscope and computer vision algorithms. It enables the collection of high-resolution images of multiple embryos under tightly controlled environmental conditions, which are then analyzed to extract a wide range of phenomic data. This platform has broad applicability and is demonstrated in experiments that assess the responses of two different species with different developmental patterns to chronic, acute, and multistressor exposure to environmental change. EmbryoPhenomics is an open-source platform that is accessible, transferable, and can be used to automate the study of embryonic development, providing valuable insights into complex organismal responses to current rates of environmental change.
This research provides a comprehensive analysis of the metabolic changes that occur during the transition of Plasmodium parasites from the asexual stages in the blood to the sexual stages in the mosquito. The study used a combination of metabolomic and reverse genetic approaches to investigate the metabolic changes that occur in key insect stages of P . berghei and the potential impact of these changes on parasite infection in the mosquito. The results suggest that these stages are highly sensitive to disruptions in multiple pathways in central carbon metabolism including the TCA cycle, the utilization of glutamine as a carbon source, intermediary carbon metabolism, and coenzyme A (CoA) synthesis. The strict dependency of these stages on multiple pathways in carbon metabolism opens new avenues for targeting parasite transmission.
Researchers have examined a common type of signaling pathway, called the incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL), and how it can process oscillatory signals. They found that the IFFL has two constraints that limit its ability to process signals. First, the kinetics of the IFFL components determine the input range for which the network can decode pulses. Second, a match between the network parameters and input signal characteristics is required for optimal "counting" of pulses. The researchers also elucidated a potential mechanism for how information processing occurs in natural networks and how their findings have implications for the design of synthetic gene circuits for this purpose.
In this study, the authors aim to improve the methods for quantification, propagation, purification, and long-term storage of Orientia tsutsugamushi. O. tsutsugamushi is an intracellular bacterium that causes scrub typhus, a life-threatening disease. The authors performed experiments using different methods for these purposes and compared the results to find the most effective ones. They used L929 cells as a host cell for O. tsutsugamushi and tested different media and temperatures for cell growth. The authors also compared different methods for purifying O. tsutsugamushi from host cells, including trypsinization, RIPA buffer, and scraping. They found that using the bullet blender for cell lysis and the SPG buffer for purification resulted in the best viability of O. tsutsugamushi. The authors also tested different methods for long-term storage of O. tsutsugamushi, including freezing and thawing, and found that freezing the bacteria in SPG buffer with 15% glycerol resulted in the best viability after storage. Overall, the authors provide valuable insights into the methods for working with O. tsutsugamushi, which could help advance our understanding of this important disease-causing organism.
This study looked at the safety and effectiveness of treating schistosome infections with Praziquantel (PZQ) in young children aged 1-5 years. The study was conducted in Zimbabwe and involved 104 children in this age group who were treated with PZQ tablets. Parents or guardians reported any side effects experienced by the children within 24 hours of taking the tablets. The study found that 3.8% of children reported side effects, which included stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation of the face and body. Despite this, PZQ was found to be safe and effective in treating schistosome infections in children aged 1-5 years. The study also compared the efficacy of PZQ treatment in children aged 1-5 years and children aged 6-10 years. It found that the efficacy of PZQ in treating schistosome infections was similar in both age groups. Overall, the study suggests that PZQ can be safely and effectively used to treat schistosome infections in children aged 1-5 years.
In this article, researchers used a new technique to identify genes that play a role in cancer and are also involved in another biological process. They used a genome-wide screen in Drosophila melanogaster to identify genes that are necessary for the overgrowth of tissues caused by a mutation in a cancer-related gene. They then used a statistical approach to identify genes that are involved in this biological process and that play a role in cancer. They found that many of the genes they identified are important for cell-cell adhesion, which is a process that is often disrupted in cancer. They also found that some of the genes they identified are involved in a signaling pathway that is important for cancer development. These findings suggest that some of the genes they identified may be important targets for cancer therapy.
We discovered a new suppressor of the Sp wtf13-2 allele in S. pombe. We named the suppressor Sp wtf18-2 . We found that Sp wtf13 and Sp wtf18-2 have high sequence identity. Sp wtf18-2 is a suppressor of Sp wtf13-2 in diploid cells but not haploid cells. We found that Sp wtf13 and Sp wtf18-2 are both 4 transmembrane domain proteins. We used a suppressor trap to isolate Sp wtf18-2. We found that Sp wtf18-2 has a short N-terminus and a long C-terminus. We found that Sp wtf18-2 forms a complex with Sp wtf13 and that this complex has both a poison and antidote function.
The paper "Predicting gene expression from genetic variation" by Rauch et al. describes an algorithm to predict the expression of genes of unseen test individuals based on their genotype data and the expression data of training individuals. The algorithm performs well, even when the training and test sets consist of individuals from different populations. The paper also presents an extension of the algorithm that incorporates heterogeneous types of genomic annotations to differentially weigh the importance of the genetic variants. Overall, the algorithm provides a useful tool for predicting gene expression and identifying the types of genetic variants that are most important for predicting expression.
We have re-examined a previous study of malaria parasite bloodstream asexual replication in immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice, which showed that competitive suppression of a less virulent clone was alleviated in immunodeficient mice. We have used a dynamical model-based Bayesian inference approach to determine the nature and extent of the competitive interactions. We have fitted the model to the experimental data and tested several competing hypotheses that may explain the competitive suppression. We have found that the competition between parasite clones is caused by host immune responses against parasites and may also be mediated by differences in RBC age preferences between the clones. These findings have important implications for understanding parasite evolution in mixed infections and could contribute to the development of new interventions against malaria.
The article explains a model called ODIRA ( Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification) that proposes how interstitial, inverted triplications can occur in the genome. The authors used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to test the model and provide evidence that the proposed replication error can occur in vitro and that the resulting dog bone can replicate in vivo to generate an inverted dimeric plasmid. They also showed that the plasmid can integrate into the genome by homologous recombination, producing an inverted triplication. The authors also found that the model is not the only one that can explain the formation of inverted triplications and that some other models are also plausible.
A new study looks at how influenza virus infects and takes over host cells. The researchers found that the virus can start producing new proteins at different parts of its genetic code, which can create new proteins that the virus can use to evade the host immune system. The researchers also found that the virus can use these new proteins to make itself more infectious to other cells. Overall, the study provides important insights into how influenza virus adapts to its host and how it evades the host immune system.
Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 is a bacterium that can cause food poisoning and kidney disease in humans. Some strains of E. coli O157:H7 have a type III secretion system (T3SS) that allows them to enter host cells and cause disease. Researchers have found that the T3SS of E. coli O157:H7 can cause neurological damage in humans. One possible way that this happens is by activating a host protein called RPS3. RPS3 is a ribosomal protein that can move into the nucleus of a host cell and cause damage to DNA. To better understand how E. coli O157:H7 causes disease, the researchers used genetic engineering to make mutant versions of the T3SS that were unable to activate RPS3. They then infected cells with the mutant versions and looked at how they behaved. The researchers found that the mutant versions of the T3SS were not able to cause RPS3 to move into the nucleus and that they were not able to cause disease in the cells. These findings suggest that the T3SS of E. coli O157:H7 is important for causing disease in humans.
In this study, we present a novel computational approach to modeling transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Our approach is based on the concept of feature-based motif models (FMMs), which describe TF binding sites in terms of a set of sequence features that are important for TF recognition. We show how FMMs can be learned efficiently from aligned TF binding site sequences, and how our approach can be extended to find de novo FMMs in unaligned sequences. We then demonstrate the utility of our approach by learning FMMs from yeast TF ChIP data, and by using the learned FMMs to find motifs in the human TF CTCF and c-MYC. Our results show that FMMs are able to capture the binding specificities of TFs much more accurately than previous models, and that our methodology is able to learn motifs that are both informative and interpretable.
The fight-or-flight response is a survival mechanism that enables organisms to quickly adapt to perceived danger or threat. This response is associated with increased sympathetic activity and increased production of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and cortisol. In humans, this response is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system, which is composed of two distinct populations of neurons, namely, the spinal sympathetic neurons and the adrenal chromaffin cells. A gene called ADRA2C codes for a protein that plays a key role in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Knockout of ADRA2C in mice results in a phenotype that is characterized by reduced sympathetic activity, including reduced production of catecholamines and cortisol. Furthermore, the knockout mice display a smaller body size and reduced activity levels. This study demonstrates that positive selection has acted on the ADRA2C gene in chimpanzees and macaques, indicating that this gene plays a critical role in the fight-or-flight response in these animals. The study also provides evidence for the existence of a chromatin-based regulatory mechanism that controls ADRA2C expression in humans, chimpanzees, and macaques. The results of this study have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of the sympathetic nervous system and its role in the fight-or-flight response in humans and other primates.
The article discusses the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, which is found in 60 different plant species. The authors compare the expression of genes in two independent C4 plants, Cleome gynandra and Zea mays, to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. They used a new informatics framework to analyze gene expression in these plants and found that many of the same genes are involved in the development of C4 leaves. Additionally, the authors discovered that homologous transcription factors are used to regulate the expression of genes in both species, indicating that this is a key feature of C4 photosynthesis. The authors conclude that their findings provide insight into the molecular convergence of C4 photosynthesis and can help inform the engineering of this process into other plant species.
During the 2013–2016 Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak in West Africa, the virus spread to Europe and North America, causing several imported cases and infections in healthcare workers (HCWs). However, it is unclear how the virus persists in different body compartments and whether it replicates in different parts of the body. To investigate this, we analyzed the presence of negative and positive sense RNA in blood and respiratory tract specimens of an HCW who was infected with EBOV while working in Sierra Leone and was treated at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases “Lazzaro Spallanzani” in Rome, Italy. We found that the virus persisted in the respiratory tract even after it was cleared from the blood, suggesting that local replication may occur. Our findings suggest that the virus can cause lung damage and may replicate in this organ. However, further research is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of viral replication in the respiratory tract.
The article describes the construction and evaluation of chimeric Machupo virus (MACV) variants that express a glycoprotein from the Junin virus (JUNV) strain Cd#1. The chimeric viruses, MCg1, MCg2, and MCg3, were rescued from plasmid constructs that contained the ectodomain of JUNV GPC, either alone or along with one or two amino acid substitutions in the transmembrane domain. All three chimeric viruses exhibited similar growth in cultured cells, but MCg1 was significantly attenuated in mice, while MCg2 and MCg3 were fully attenuated. The attenuation of MCg1 was associated with reduced viral dissemination and mild disease symptoms in mice, while the attenuation of MCg2 and MCg3 was associated with the expression of neutralizing antibodies against JUNV in mice. Overall, the results suggest that both the ectodomain and the transmembrane domain of JUNV GPC contribute to the attenuation of MACV.
In order to study the functional constraints of the centromere-specific histone CENH3, the authors created transgenic plants with single amino acid changes in conserved residues of the histone fold domain. These lines were then crossed with wild-type plants and the effects on chromosome segregation during meiosis were analyzed. They found that these transgenic lines had post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants, indicating that the centromeres marked by these missense mutations in the histone fold domain of CENH3 reproduced the genome elimination syndromes described with chimeric CENH3 and CENH3 from diverged species. The authors also identified a non-transgenic line carrying the A86V substitution within the histone fold domain that reproduced the same phenotype, demonstrating the simplicity of this approach to create haploid-inducing lines. These results highlight the importance of CENH3 in centromere function and chromosome segregation and have implications for understanding and engineering genetic diversity in crops.
In this study, we used alternative splicing (AS) analysis to compare the gene expression patterns of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and cardiac progenitor cells (CPs) derived from hESCs. We identified AS events that were differentially regulated in hESCs and CPs and characterized the predicted changes in protein domains and motifs that could affect protein function and expression. We also identified microRNA binding sites that were predicted to be regulated by AS. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate hESC self-renewal and differentiation into CPs, and may have important implications for understanding human development and disease.
The study is about the importance of a protein called trehalose-6-phosphatase (T6P) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The authors show that T6P is essential for the survival of the bacteria and that its deletion leads to growth defects. They also demonstrate that T6P is required for the formation of trehalose, a sugar that helps the bacteria survive in harsh environments. The authors use conditional gene silencing to show that T6P is important for the growth of M. tuberculosis in vivo, and they propose that T6P could be a target for anti-tuberculosis drug development.
The study of the conformational dynamics of the proline racemase enzyme from the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi has provided new insights into the mechanisms of the enzyme's catalytic activity. The study used computational tools such as molecular dynamics simulations and a molecular mechanics approach to analyze the conformational dynamics of the enzyme. It revealed a number of key structural features that contribute to the enzyme's catalytic activity, including a large opening movement that is coupled to catalysis. The study also identified a number of critical residues that are involved in the opening movement and are required for catalysis. These findings provide new insights into the enzyme's function and could be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies against Chagas' disease.
The research article describes a new method for studying the function of genes in living organisms by controlling their expression in a reversible and inducible way. The method is called iKO (inducible and reversible knockout) and it uses two genetically modified mouse lines: a KO line, which has a tetracycline-dependent transactivator instead of the endogenous gene, and a TIGRE line, which has a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene. The target gene can be turned on or off by adding or removing doxycycline, a type of antibiotic. The iKO method has several advantages over other methods, such as the ability to switch off and on the gene expression, high degree of regulation, efficiency, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. The researchers used the iKO method to create a knockout of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, which plays a key role in regulating cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis progression. The results showed that the iKO method allowed for reversible switching of ApoE transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The researchers concluded that the iKO method is a powerful tool for studying gene function and that it has many potential applications in biomedical research.
Infecting a mammalian fetus with T. cruzi is a complex process that involves the placenta, the mother, and the parasite. Using placental tissues from infected mice, we identified differentially regulated genes and pathways. We found that K98 and VD strains of T. cruzi have different effects on the placental environment, with VD inducing a pro-inflammatory response. The results of our study provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of congenital infection and suggest that T. cruzi strains may have different capacities to establish infection and pathology in the fetus.
The Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic virus that causes arthralgia/arthritis in humans. The SINV has been isolated from vector mosquitoes sampled in several areas of central Sweden including the River Dalälven floodplains. The prevalence of SINV was investigated in blood-seeking female mosquitoes captured within the regional mosquito control operator Biological Mosquito Control (BMC) mosquito surveillance program in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The study revealed that the mosquito species Culex torrentium/pipiens, Culiseta morsitans, Aedes cinereus and Aedes rossicus were the potential enzootic and bridge vectors for SINV. The virus prevalence was higher in 2002 than in 2001 and 2003, and the mosquitoes from the floodplains were the major SINV carriers. The study provides evidence for the importance of mosquito surveillance for SINV detection and emphasizes the need for additional research on the ecology, transmission dynamics and disease risks associated with SINV.
The neural circuits of the brain use a variety of encoding strategies to represent the information received from external stimuli. These strategies can be observed in the behavior of individual neurons and how they are connected to other neurons. In this study, we modeled how olfactory information is encoded in the antennal lobe of the locust brain. We used a computational model to represent the behavior of neurons in the antennal lobe and how they are connected to each other. We found that neurons in the antennal lobe use a strategy called sparse coding, in which they encode only the most important features of a stimulus. This strategy helps the brain to efficiently represent the vast amount of information it receives from the external environment.
In this study, we used two-way clustering analysis to identify groups of genes associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and tested their relationships to coronary atherosclerosis. We found that a group of genes involved in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TEML) is overrepresented in all three clusters related to CAD. Moreover, the transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 (LDB2) was identified as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the TEML group. We also found that the TEML group is enriched with common variants associated with CAD. Our results suggest that the TEML pathway is important for atherosclerosis development and that LDB2 merits further attention in CAD research.
This study investigated the regulation of kaiBC transcription in the cyanobacterial circadian clock. Using a TTFL/PTO model, the authors systematically analyzed various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional feedback regulation by introducing a combined TTFL/PTO model. The optimal two-loop feedback model was found to have threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate and unphosphorylated KaiC hexamers suppress kaiBC transcription. The peak expression ratio of the positive and negative component of kaiBC expression was the main factor for how the different two-loop feedback models responded to removal or overexpression of kai genes. The findings of this study provide new insights into the regulation of kaiBC transcription in the cyanobacterial circadian clock.
A lay summary of the provided content is: This study investigated the characteristics of HIV-2 reservoirs in individuals infected with HIV-2 alone. The study found that HIV-2 infection is associated with a limited reservoir of infected TCM.
The Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) model is a comprehensive framework that aims to explain how selective attention is implemented in the visual cortex. The model proposes that attention is implemented via a hierarchical network of interconnected cortical areas, where each area is responsible for processing a specific aspect of a visual scene. The model proposes that this network uses a set of nonlinear computations to perform attentional routing between areas, allowing them to focus on specific aspects of the scene while ignoring others. The model also incorporates several key features of the visual cortex, including dendritic nonlinearities, feedback connections, and the hierarchical organization of cortical areas. The ARC model has been shown to be able to replicate a wide range of experimental findings related to visual attention, including spatial and temporal attention, and attention to motion and shape. Overall, the ARC model provides a powerful framework for understanding how attention is implemented in the visual cortex.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart problem that can cause significant health problems. In this study, researchers looked at the association between AF and genetic variation in the coding regions of the genome. They used whole exome sequencing data from a large community-based sample of individuals with and without AF from four different studies. The researchers did not find any significant associations between coding genetic variants and AF. However, they did find a common missense variant in the SYNPO2L gene that may be associated with AF. They also found no significant associations between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. The researchers concluded that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF and that more research is needed to identify the genetic basis of AF.
Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a dangerous disease caused by the larval stage of a parasite called Echinococcus multilocularis. It is found in the Northern Hemisphere, including Poland, where it was first detected in the 1990s. The disease spreads slowly, and it can be fatal. Most cases are diagnosed in the later stages of the disease, when it is already difficult to treat. The disease is more common in areas where there are many foxes, as they are the main carriers of the parasite. There are efforts to increase awareness of the disease among doctors and the public, and to improve screening and treatment options.
This research aims to identify the structural basis of Zur-DNA interaction and understand how this interaction leads to different levels of gene expression under different Zn2+ concentrations. The study provides evidence that the differential gene expression under different Zn2+ concentrations is caused by changes in the number of Zur dimers bound to DNA, rather than changes in the DNA binding affinity of a single Zur dimer. This is supported by the finding that a single Zur dimer bound to DNA can interact with two adjacent DNA molecules, leading to cooperative binding. The study also identifies a new Zur-regulated gene, pliG, which encodes a protein involved in ribosome biogenesis. The research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of metal-responsive gene regulation and the molecular basis of cooperative DNA binding by transcription factors.
The study aimed at understanding the mechanisms that explain the recurrent circulation of Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) in a temperate and mountainous area of Madagascar. The authors used a spatialized metapopulation model to simulate the transmission of RVFV in cattle populations living in villages and mosquito populations breeding in rice fields. They used data collected between 2009 and 2011, including serological surveys, entomological surveys, and a longitudinal follow-up of cattle populations. The model was used to analyze three potential scenarios that could explain the recurrent circulation of RVFV in the study area: (i) RVFV overwintering thanks to a direct transmission between cattle, vectors being absent during winter, (ii) a low level vector-based circulation during winter thanks to a residual vector population, without direct transmission between cattle, and (iii) a combination of both above mentioned mechanisms. The results showed that the RVFV circulation in the area could be explained by a combination of both direct and vector-based transmission, with a low level vector-based circulation during winter. The study provides useful insights into the mechanisms of RVFV circulation in this temperate area of Madagascar and highlights the importance of both direct and vector-based transmission in maintaining the virus in the animal population. The findings may be useful for informing disease control strategies in similar areas.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a globally invasive species that has been introduced to many countries in Asia, Australia and the Americas. This study uses 13 microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA to investigate the population structure, genetics and invasion history of Ae. albopictus in the Australasian region. The study reveals that Ae. albopictus has been introduced into Southeast Asia and Australia from at least two different sources and has been spread throughout these regions by human movement. The study also reveals that recent colonization events have occurred in some populations, including the Torres Strait Islands in Australia and some parts of Southeast Asia. The study provides valuable information for understanding the spread and control of Ae. albopictus, a mosquito that is a vector of several important human diseases.
This study was conducted to determine the impact of schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease, on children's physical fitness and quality of life. The study included 572 children aged 7 to 8 years from 50 villages in the Lake Victoria Region of Tanzania, where schistosomiasis is common. The children's parasitological status was determined using the Kato-Katz thick smear technique and their physical fitness was measured using the 20-meter shuttle run test. Physical fitness was found to be significantly associated with schistosomiasis infection. Children with schistosomiasis had higher VO2 max values than those without schistosomiasis, indicating better physical fitness. Additionally, children with schistosomiasis had lower scores in the emotional dimension of quality of life, indicating a poorer emotional well-being. Overall, the study suggests that schistosomiasis may have a negative impact on children's quality of life and physical fitness. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms behind these associations and to develop effective interventions to improve children's quality of life and physical fitness in schistosomiasis-endemic areas.
This study compares the effect of subcutaneous and conjunctival-mucosal inoculation routes of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni on renal colonization and urinary excretion in rats. The subcutaneous route resulted in lower renal colonization and urinary excretion than the conjunctival-mucosal route. The study also investigated other potential excretion routes such as saliva and feces. The results suggest that the conjunctival-mucosal route may play a more important role in the transmission of Leptospira between rats than previously thought. The findings of this study could have implications for understanding the natural transmission of Leptospira in rat populations and for the development of more effective control strategies.
Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition in which the body's response to infection becomes excessive and damages its own tissues. Annexin A2 (AnxA2) is a protein that helps to regulate inflammatory responses. Researchers have found that mice lacking AnxA2 were more likely to develop severe sepsis and had increased inflammation and tissue damage. They also found that AnxA2 helped to reduce oxidative stress and IL-17A levels, which are both factors that contribute to inflammation. The researchers used genetic engineering techniques to reduce the levels of IL-17A in mice lacking AnxA2, and found that this helped to reduce inflammation and improve survival rates. These findings suggest that AnxA2 may be a potential target for treating sepsis.
HIV-1 infection is a major cause of death worldwide. The infection is characterized by a rapid loss of CD4+ T cells, which are key regulators of the immune response. Macrophages, a major cell population in the body, are thought to be an important reservoir for HIV-1, and are therefore a major target for the development of new therapies to control the infection. TLRs are an important class of pattern recognition receptors that recognize conserved molecular patterns present on invading microorganisms. The engagement of TLRs by their ligands triggers an inflammatory response that is crucial for the clearance of the infection. However, HIV-1 has developed mechanisms to inhibit TLR-mediated responses, which may contribute to the development of AIDS. In this study, the authors investigated the effect of TLR stimulation on HIV-1 infection in macrophages from different donors. They found that stimulation of TLR3 or TLR7 in MDMs by poly(I:C) or Imiquimod, respectively, resulted in a significant decrease in infection by CCR5-using HIV-1. In addition, they found that TLR stimulation resulted in the accumulation of early and late RT products in the cytoplasm and a decrease in the levels of pro-viral DNA, indicating that TLR stimulation may be inhibiting the integration of HIV-1 into the host genome. The authors also found that miR-155 may be involved in the regulation of this anti-HIV-1 response, as its expression was increased specifically by TLR3 and TLR7 stimulation, and its expression correlated with the degree of HIV-1 inhibition. In addition, the authors found that ectopic expression of miR-155 resulted in an increase in the levels of LEDGF, TNPO3, and ADAM10, which are important regulators of HIV-1 infection. Finally, the authors found that siRNA-mediated knockdown of these targets resulted in a decrease in the anti-HIV-1 response mediated by TLR3 and TLR7 stimulation, suggesting that these targets may be involved in the regulation of this response. Together, these findings suggest that TLR3 and TLR7 stimulation may be a promising approach for the development of new therapies to control HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have investigated the way the circadian clock regulates plant growth and development. They found that the circadian clock interacts with light signals to control the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis, catabolism, receptor, and signaling of multiple phytohormones. This integration results in the regulation of growth by phytohormones and creates time-of-day specificity for growth. The authors suggest that the circadian clock indirectly controls growth by maintaining light signaling during the early part of the evening, which ensures that peak phytohormone transcript abundance coincides with the end of the dark period.
The paper is about a new way to control a disease vector by using a bacterial method. The idea is to feed the insect with bacteria that produces a gene-silencing substance, which will interfere with the development and reproduction of the insect. This method is called RNA interference. The paper is about using this method to control a disease vector called R. prolixus, which is a mosquito-like insect that transmits a disease called Chagas. The study shows that feeding R. prolixus with bacteria that produces a substance that silences a gene called RHBP, which is important for the development of the insect, can lead to a decrease in the number of eggs laid by the insect. The study also shows that feeding R. prolixus with bacteria that produces a substance that silences a gene called CAT, which is important for the immune system of the insect, can lead to a decrease in the number of eggs laid by the insect and an increase in the mortality rate of the insect.
This article is about fever in pregnant women and the causes of fever in pregnant women in the Thai-Burmese border region. The study was conducted on pregnant women who attended antenatal clinics from 2004 to 2006. Of the 409 pregnant women who had fever, the main cause was malaria in 55.5%. A cohort of 203 pregnant women was followed up for one month. Scrub and murine typhus were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. The study recommends treating febrile pregnant women with azithromycin, as it is effective against typhus and leptospirosis. The study also suggests that a simple rapid immunochromatographic test for scrub typhus could be used for screening pregnant women with fever in this region.
Age-related variation in recombination rates in humans was studied using dense genotyping of 657,823 autosomal SNPs in a French-Canadian cohort of 68 nuclear families with 242 individuals affected with left-sided congenital heart disease. Recombination events were localized at high resolution using a previously described heuristic algorithm. The study confirmed that maternal age is associated with a decrease in recombination rates in humans and that this effect is stronger in some chromosomes. The observed decrease in recombination rates with maternal age was not due to increased non-disjunction with age, as it remained significant after correction for genome-wide variation in recombination rates and the number of children per mother. The observed decrease in recombination rate with maternal age could reflect a protective effect of recombination against non-disjunction in some chromosomes. The findings support the hypothesis that protection against non-disjunction becomes less efficient with advancing maternal age in some chromosomes and that this effect may contribute to an increased risk of chromosomal aneuploidies with age.
Developing a vaccine for cryptococcosis, a fungal disease that affects the lungs, is challenging due to the immunosuppressive nature of the host. This study aimed to develop an innovative approach to induce an immune response in macrophages, the major effector cells of the innate immune system against cryptococcosis, without requiring an adaptive immune response. This was achieved by administering a mucosal vaccine to immunocompromised mice that induced an immune response in macrophages that protected against cryptococcosis. The study used two different strains of Cryptococcus, one that was virulent and one that was less virulent, to test the vaccine. The vaccine was administered intranasally to mice and induced an immune response in macrophages that protected against cryptococcosis, even in the absence of an adaptive immune response. The study found that the vaccine induced an immune response in macrophages by inducing a form of memory called trained immunity. This trained immunity was mediated by histone modifications and was maintained for at least 70 days after the vaccine was administered. The study also found that the vaccine protected against cryptococcosis by inducing cytokine recall responses in macrophages. This cytokine recall response was mediated by epigenetic modifications and was sustained for at least 70 days after the vaccine was administered. The study also tested the effect of different histone deacetylase inhibitors on the vaccine response and found that some inhibitors enhanced the vaccine response while others had no effect. This study provides a novel approach to developing a vaccine for cryptococcosis that does not require an adaptive immune response. This approach could be used to develop vaccines for other fungal diseases that affect the lungs and could be used to develop vaccines for other infectious diseases.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) are a type of epigenetic machinery that regulates gene expression during plant and animal development. These complexes can be divided into two main types: PRC1 and PRC2, which work together to repress gene expression by catalyzing specific epigenetic modifications. To better understand how the functional specificity of PRCs is established, researchers have recently analyzed the genome-wide changes in epigenetic modifications in plants with different PRC components removed. They found that PRC2 and PRC1 have different target genes, which are associated with specific transcription factors (TFs). These findings suggest that different combinations of PRC members target different developmental programs and that their target specificity is modulated by specific TFs.
We have used deep mutational scanning to analyze the fitness and phenotypic landscape of S. cerevisiae Pol II's TL. We have identified three distinct classes of transcriptionally defective TL mutants that are associated with differential stress response profiles. We have examined the mechanisms by which proximal Pol II domains communicate with the TL and identified examples of inter-residue epistasis that are likely drivers of incompatibility of RNAP evolutionary variants when placed in the Pol II context. Our results provide insights into the functional contributions of each TL residue and a comprehensive framework for understanding Pol II function and evolution.
In this study, the authors infected mice with the dog-associated rabies virus ( RV ) strain DOG4 or the silver-haired bat-associated RV strain SB either intramuscularly or intravenously. They monitored the progression of clinical signs of rabies and used immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) to follow the spread of the virus from the infection site to the brain. The authors found that only i . v . administered SB directly infected the forebrain of the mouse, while both strains caused a lethal infection when inoculated i . m . . The authors suggest that hematogenous spread of SB can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. This finding has implications for the post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly with silver-haired bat-associated RV.
The H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans, first documented in the global pandemic of 1918 and continuing to the present day. Despite its substantial burden on human health, the evolutionary history of the A/H1N1 virus is not well understood, particularly whether there is a virological basis for several notable epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s. Using a data set of 71 representative complete genome sequences sampled between 1918 and 2006, we show that segmental reassortment has played an important role in the genomic evolution of A/H1N1 since 1918. Specifically, we demonstrate that an A/H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may also have been associated with reassortant A/H1N1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassortment therefore appears to be a more important process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously realized.
Researchers have found that nicotine, which is the addictive substance in tobacco, affects the activity of dopamine (DA) neurons in the brain. Nicotine can directly activate these neurons or can indirectly activate them by inhibiting other neurons that normally inhibit the DA neurons. The researchers developed a mathematical model to help explain how nicotine affects these neurons, and how different factors such as the concentration of nicotine, the type of nAChRs being activated, and the rate of acetylcholine release affect the overall effect. The researchers suggest that the rate of acetylcholine input is an important factor in determining whether nicotine affects the DA neurons directly or indirectly. They also suggest that nicotine can have both acute and long-term effects on the brain, and that further research is needed to fully understand these effects.
This is a summary of the article "Evaluation of a new concept for the treatment of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to Leishmania tropica in Afghanistan: A randomized controlled phase IIa trial". The article describes a randomized controlled phase IIa trial that evaluated a new concept for the treatment of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to Leishmania tropica in Afghanistan. The new concept consisted of bipolar high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by moist wound treatment (MWT) with or without 0.045% DAC N-055 (which is equivalent to 5 mM pharmaceutical sodium chlorite). The trial was conducted from 2004 to 2007 and included 100 male and female patients aged 5 years and older. The primary objective was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the new treatment concept by assessing the time needed for complete epithelialization of the lesion wound. The results showed that the time needed for complete epithelialization was significantly shorter in the group that received EC plus MWT with DAC N-055 than in the group that received EC plus MWT without DAC N-055. The trial also evaluated the secondary objectives of assessing the parasite load within the lesion and the safety of the new treatment concept. Overall, the results of the trial suggest that the new treatment concept is safe and effective for the treatment of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) due to Leishmania tropica in Afghanistan.
The small GTPase RAS is commonly found to be overexpressed in cancer cells, and it often leads to the activation of the RAF-MEK-MAPK signaling pathway. This study used a quantitative assay to screen a large number of genes in Drosophila S2 cells, looking for those that affect the activation of MAPK by RAS. The study found 101 genes that affected MAPK activation, including some known components of the RAF-MEK-MAPK pathway. However, the study also found a large number of genes that acted downstream of MEK and specifically influenced MAPK expression. These genes were mainly constitutive splicing factors, suggesting that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. Two representative members of this group of splicing factors were further characterized, and it was found that they act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. Overall, this study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila. It suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events, such as those controlling RAF activation, but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. Finally, it indicates that core splicing components can also impact alternative splicing.
Cryptococcosis is a serious disease caused by the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii. The yeasts are found in soil and tree bark in many parts of the world. Cryptococcosis was first described in Thailand in the 1960s, but the causes of the disease have not been well studied. In this study, 498 isolates of the C . neoformans/C . gattii species complex were analyzed to determine the major molecular types and compare them with previous studies. The results showed that most of the isolates were from males and that VNI was the major molecular type found in all isolates, regardless of their source (clinical, environmental, or veterinary). VNII was found in 2.4% of the isolates, VNIV in 0.2%, and VGI and VGII in 2.4% and 0.2%, respectively. The study also revealed a greater genetic diversity of Thai cryptococcal isolates compared to previous studies. Overall, this study provides valuable information on the major molecular types of cryptococcal isolates in Thailand and helps to identify potential outbreaks of the disease.
This study reveals that many single-copy transcription factor genes in Drosophila show changes in DNA-binding specificity over evolutionary time, challenging the assumption that single-copy genes are highly conserved. By comparing DNA-binding specificity across 12 closely related fly species, the authors show that a significant proportion of single-copy transcription factor genes in Drosophila have changed their DNA-binding specificity over evolutionary time, often in ways that increase the diversity of predicted binding motifs. These findings have implications for our understanding of the regulatory evolution of Drosophila and other higher metazoans.
In this article, researchers developed a new molecular method to identify typhoid and paratyphoid fever-causing bacteria. They used the CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) region as a target for the development of serotype-specific PCRs. They successfully developed and validated singleplex and multiplex, conventional and real-time PCRs for rapid identification of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates. These PCRs can be used as an alternative to serology and culture methods for the diagnosis of typhoid and paratyphoid fever.
The protective immune response to intracellular parasites typically involves differentiation of IFNγ-secreting CD4+ T helper (Th1) cells. The role of Notch signaling in the differentiation of this immune response following infection with the parasite Leishmania major was investigated. Mice with gene ablation of Notch 1 or 2, or both, in T cells showed reduced susceptibility to L. major infection and the development of Th1 cells. In contrast, mice with a gene deletion of RBP-Jκ, the major effector of Notch receptors, were able to develop IFNγ-secreting Th1 cells, kill parasites, and heal their lesions. These results suggest that Notch signaling is required for the differentiation of a functional Th1 immune response following L. major infection and that this process is independent of RBP-Jκ.
A recent study has examined the relationship between parasitic worm infections and the risk of HIV-1 infection in sub-Saharan Africa. The study used a relevant in vivo model of rhesus monkeys infected with the parasite Schistosoma mansoni and challenged with an HIV-1 strain that is most relevant to humans. The results showed that pre-existing infection with S. mansoni significantly increased the risk of HIV-1 acquisition, with lower doses of HIV-1 causing systemic infection in parasitized animals compared to controls. Additionally, parasitized animals had higher peak viral loads and increased viral replication in CD4+ central memory cells. These findings suggest that controlling helminth infections may be a useful public health intervention to help decrease the spread of HIV-1.
The article describes the role of acetylcholine (ACh) in the regulation of neural excitability and patterns of activity in the brain. The authors use a computational model of cholinergic modulation in cortical networks to show how changes in neural excitability and network structure interact to create different functional regimes. The authors found that reductions in spike frequency adaptation (SFA) and a shift in the phase response curve (PRC) caused by ACh can lead to three distinct functional regimes: localized asynchronous, traveling asynchronous, and traveling synchronous activity. The authors also showed that the level of ACh determines how sensitive network activity is to synaptic heterogeneity. The article provides important insights into the role and significance of ACh in determining patterns of cortical activity and functional differences arising from those patterns.
The provided content is a scientific article written in English that is related to cancer research. The article discusses how genetic mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway may contribute to the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a type of cancer that arises in the esophagus. The authors of the article use whole-genome sequencing data from 179 EAC patients and 229 matched normal tissue samples to identify non-synonymous mutations in the TLR pathway. They then use the PathScan software tool to determine if these mutations are significantly enriched in the EAC samples compared to normal tissue samples. The authors find that 9 of 18 genes in the TLR pathway are mutated in at least one EAC sample. They also find that patients with mutations in the TLR pathway have more proximal tumors and are more likely to have lymph node metastasis. Using luciferase reporter assays, the authors show that TLR4 mutations impair downstream signaling in the TLR pathway, leading to reduced inflammatory responses. The authors suggest that genetic mutations in the TLR pathway may contribute to the development of EAC by impairing the inflammatory response that is thought to play a role in the development of this cancer.
In this study, we investigated the role of Hes1 in the development of taste cells. We used a novel approach to investigate the transcriptional regulation of taste cell development by combining in silico and in vivo analyses . We discovered that TRCSMs (taste receptor calcium signaling molecules) colocalized within developing CVP (circumvallate papillae). We then used computational analysis of the upstream regulatory regions of TRCSMs to investigate the possibility of a common regulatory network for TRCSM transcription. Based on this analysis, we identified Hes1 as a likely common regulatory factor, and examined its function in vivo. We found that decreased expression of nuclear HES1 correlated with the expression of type II taste cell markers. After stage E18, the CVP of Hes1-/- mutants displayed over 5-fold more TRCSM-immunoreactive cells than did the CVP of their wild-type littermates. Our results suggest that Hes1 plays a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds.

Overall, the article provides a clear and accessible summary of a complex scientific study and highlights the potential impact of the research on agriculture and food security.
This article describes a study that looked at the spread of a certain type of bacteria called Mycobacterium (NTM) in Saudi Arabia. The study involved the collection of 527 NTM isolates from different parts of the country over a 2-year period. The NTM species were identified using line probe assays and sequencing of four highly conserved genes. The study found that M. simiae, M. fortuitum, and M. abscessus were the most common species. The results also identified risk factors associated with NTM diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and previous history of tuberculosis. The article highlights the importance of conducting epidemiological studies to understand the disease spectrum and pathogen diversity of NTM in Saudi Arabia.
The study in the article is about how yeast cells are able to survive longer when they stop growing and enter a state of rest called quiescence. Researchers have been studying the genes that help cells enter quiescence and survive longer in that state. They found that the TOR pathway is involved in both quiescence entry and lifespan extension, and that two other pathways, the PKA and SNF1 pathways, also play a role. They also found that glycogen and trehalose, which are stored carbohydrates, help to increase the lifespan of yeast cells.
Influenza virus escapes from neutralizing antibodies by amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein, which reduces antibody affinity and/or function. These substitutions also affect receptor binding avidity of the HA globular domain, which can increase or decrease virus replication. The authors used the primerID method of error-correcting viral population sequencing to reveal that glycosylation of HA can compensate for fitness costs imposed by escape substitutions elsewhere on HA. This finding expands our understanding of the viral mechanisms that maintain fitness during antigenic evolution.
The paper describes a study that looked at how the rate at which the heart beats can affect how long an action potential (AP) lasts. This is important because some antiarrhythmic drugs have the unwanted side effect of prolonging the AP, making the heart less efficient. The study used mathematical models to analyze how different parameters affect AP duration at different rates. They found that many parameters can cause the AP to be longer at faster rates, which could be helpful in designing new antiarrhythmic drugs. The study also found that some parameters can cause the AP to be longer at slower rates, which can be harmful. Overall, the study provides new insights into how the rate at which the heart beats affects the AP and how this can be used to design new antiarrhythmic drugs.
Phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) are a way to identify which genetic variations are associated with certain diseases or medical conditions. In this study, the researchers developed a new way to perform PheWAS on a quantitative trait using both ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results. They tested their approach using the example of TPMT (thiopurine S-methyltransferase) activity. They grouped patients into categories based on their TPMTa level and then compared the distribution of cases between these groups. They also used different algorithms to group patients based on their biological test results and then compared the distribution of cases between these groups. By using both ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results, the researchers were able to identify new subgroups of patients with different characteristics. This could help doctors make more personalized decisions about treatment and care.
Spinal cord injuries can cause serious problems, and stem cells may be able to help with recovery. Researchers found that stem cells improved motor and sensory function in animals with spinal cord injuries. The stem cells that had the best effects were from other animals, not the same animal as the ones with the injury. The stem cells also worked better when they were differentiated before being implanted, and when they were implanted through an intravenous route. However, stem cell implantation did not improve sensory outcomes in female animals and appeared to be enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. Additionally, there was some evidence for a dose–response relationship, where more stem cells were associated with better outcomes. These results suggest that stem cells may be useful for treating spinal cord injuries, but more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness and to understand how they work.
Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are a group of parasites that can cause infections in people. These infections are found mostly in developing countries and in rural areas. The four most common STH are Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), and two species of hookworms. People can become infected with these parasites through contact with contaminated soil or by eating food contaminated with eggs. Once infected, people may suffer from symptoms such as anemia, growth stunting, and impaired cognitive development. To control these infections, a preventive chemotherapy strategy is used. This strategy involves the repeated administration of anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations. However, this strategy does not prevent reinfection. To better understand this, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. The review analyzed data from 51 studies, which included 24 studies that provided STH infection rates pre- and post-treatment, and 42 studies that reported determinants of predisposition to reinfection. The review found that reinfection rates for A. lumbricoides, T. trichiura, and hookworms were high at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Factors that predicted reinfection included the initial infection status, age, and poor hygiene practices. The review suggests that frequent anthelmintic drug administrations are needed to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Integrated control approaches emphasizing health education, environmental sanitation, and other interventions are also needed to interrupt transmission of STH.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease that is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Gene deregulation occurs when the cell does not maintain precise control over certain genes and can lead to the development of diseases such as NAFLD. To study gene deregulation in NAFLD, pathway enrichment analysis (PEA) can be used. However, PEA can miss important conceptual information about the wide range of complex metabolic interactions. To overcome this, a method called Minimal Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) has been developed. MiNEA compares two conditions using transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to identify deregulated minimal networks (MiNs), which are reactions pertaining to various metabolic subsystems that can synthesize a target metabolite. MiNEA can identify alternative routes for a given metabolic task, and can be applied to mouse and human liver samples. MiNEA can also identify deregulated metabolic processes in mice and humans that potentially lead to the NAFLD phenotypes.
This paper uses mathematical modeling to study how the olfactory system identifies and discriminates odors. One way that the olfactory system identifies odors is through primacy coding, where the identity of an odor is encoded by the receptor types that respond first. The authors used numerical simulations and statistical descriptions to show that primacy coding provides a compact and informative representation of odors. This representation is independent of the odor intensity, which helps to identify odors in the olfactory cortex. The authors found that primacy coding is more useful than other coding schemes, because it is independent of the odor statistics. This allows the olfactory system to identify odors even when the odor composition and intensity change. The authors also found that overly sensitive receptor types could dominate the response and make the entire array useless. This finding can be used to understand how the olfactory system adapts to different environments.
The study aimed to determine the extent to which HIV bnMAbs display incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal slopes at <100% for HIV bnMAbs. The study found that bnMAbs targeting certain neutralizing epitopes of the Env spike were more likely to show neutralization curves that plateau at <100%. The study found that bnMAbs targeting the V2 apex of Env and gp41 were most likely to show behavior. The study also found that two CD4 binding site Abs displayed this behavior relatively infrequently. In addition, the study found that five bnMAbs were compared against an 18-virus panel of molecular clones produced in 293T cells and PBMCs and assayed in TZM-bl cells. Examples of plateaus <90% were seen with both types of virus production with no consistent patterns observed. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering the neutralizing epitopes of the Env spike and the role glycans play in each epitope before interpreting neutralization results.
Cancer cells have a restricted set of metabolic features that give them an advantage in competition with normal cells. These features, which include enhanced aerobic glycolysis and glutamine reductive carboxylation, are thought to be important for cancer cells to grow and proliferate. However, the exact mechanisms that drive these features and how they interact with each other are not well understood. To better understand the metabolic changes that occur in cancer cells, researchers used a mathematical model to simulate the different ways that glucose and glutamine could be used to fuel cell growth. The model included reactions for aerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, glutamine reductive carboxylation, and other pathways that are important for cell growth. The researchers then used the model to simulate different scenarios in which the availability of glucose or glutamine varied. By analyzing the results of these simulations, the researchers were able to identify the specific reactions and pathways that were most important for cell growth under different conditions. They also were able to predict how the cells would respond to changes in the availability of glucose or glutamine, which could help guide the development of new treatments for cancer.
Prion proteins are involved in many important cellular functions, including cell adhesion, signal transduction, and protein folding. However, the precise molecular interactions between Prions and their paralogs are still not well understood. In this study, we used a quantitative proteomic approach to investigate the interactions of Prions with their paralogs Dpl and Sho in mouse neuroblastoma cells. We found that all three proteins form highly similar interactomes, with many proteins involved in ER chaperoning and protein folding. These interactions suggest that Prions may organize their molecular environment by their ability to recognize specific subsets of cell adhesion molecules, which recruit membrane proteins carrying high-mannose glycans into spatial proximity with Prions. Inhibition of these ER chaperones can increase Prion levels in prion-infected cells. These results suggest a new scenario whereby Prions may regulate their own posttranslational processing by controlling the function of ER chaperones.
Influenza virus infection induces a strong immune response, which is characterized by the production of type I cytokines. However, recent studies have shown that type II cytokines are also induced during influenza virus infection, particularly in individuals with pre-existing allergic diseases such as asthma. It has been suggested that type II cytokines may play a protective role in influenza virus infection. In this study, we have investigated the role of type II cytokines during influenza virus infection. We have found that during influenza virus infection, there is abundant production of the type II cytokine IL-5 in the infected respiratory tract. IL-5 production is primarily the product of ILC2, a type of immune cell that is capable of producing large amounts of IL-5 and IL-13 when stimulated by IL-25 and IL-33. We have also found that IL-5 is essential for the recruitment and accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs following influenza virus infection, particularly during the recovery phase when infectious virus has been cleared. Our results suggest that ILC2 may play a protective role during influenza virus infection by stimulating the recruitment and accumulation of eosinophils, which can help to remove viral particles and damaged cells from the lungs.
The article describes a study of invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella infections (iNTS) in Vietnam. The study included 102 patients, 71% of whom were HIV-infected and more than 90% of whom were adults. The most commonly identified serovars of iNTS were S. Enteritidis and S. Typhimurium. S. Typhimurium was significantly more common in HIV-infected individuals. Isolates from HIV-infected patients were more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than HIV-negative patients. The authors conclude that iNTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam with a high mortality rate, and that HIV infection is a risk factor for death. They emphasize the importance of understanding iNTS infections in Vietnam and other developing countries.
The study describes a new method for identifying phage and viral structural proteins using neural networks that were trained on amino acid frequencies. The method can be used to identify phage structural proteins such as major and minor capsid proteins, tail proteins, and coat proteins from non-phage structural proteins. The method was shown to be highly accurate using both test cases and a large set of curated phage sequences.
In this study, we investigated the function of the viral protein ORF20 in the context of a KSHV-infected cell line. ORF20 is a KSHV-specific gene that has been implicated in viral replication, but its exact role remains unknown. We used a genetic approach to investigate the function of ORF20 in KSHV-infected cells. We constructed a mutant of ORF20 that blocks its translation into ORF20 protein and tested its effect on KSHV replication. We also used genetic complementation to investigate the function of ORF20 in the context of a KSHV-infected cell line. We found that ORF20 is required for the efficient replication of KSHV, and that it interacts with the host protein OASL to promote viral replication. Our results provide important insights into the function of ORF20 in KSHV-infected cells.
This study was a prospective study of 913 children admitted to Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital with fever. The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of Lassa virus disease in febrile children with and without convulsions. The study found that the overall prevalence of LVD in febrile children was 3.5% (95% CI = 1.9%, 5.7%) and that children with FC were not more likely to have LVD than those with NFC. The study also found that the clinical presentation of LVD was similar to that of other viral haemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola and Marburg virus diseases. The study concludes that LVD is an important cause of fever in children in endemic areas, but that it is not significantly associated with convulsions associated with fever.
This study investigates the function of KAI2, a protein receptor for karrikins, a class of smoke-derived compounds that promote seed germination. The authors report that kai2 mutants exhibit reduced survival after water deficit in a drought-resistant growth medium, indicating that KAI2 is involved in plant adaptation to water stress. They also found that KAI2-dependent signaling is involved in drought-resistance, as the d14 mutant, which has a defective SL signaling pathway, did not show a drought-sensitive phenotype when KAI2 was mutated. The authors conclude that KAI2 plays a key role in water stress adaptation and that it interacts with other signaling pathways to promote drought resistance.
In this study, we aimed to explore the functional roles of SjIR1 and SjIR2 in adult S . japonicum worms. We used RNAi to knock down the expression of SjIR1 and SjIR2 in adult worms and investigated their effects on glucose metabolism and fecundity. Our results showed that the knockdown of SjIR1 and SjIR2 significantly reduced the number of mature intestinal eggs and the output of faecal eggs, and also inhibited glucose uptake by worms. These findings suggest that SjIR1 and SjIR2 play important roles in the growth and reproduction of S . japonicum.
This paper describes a new approach to fighting a disease called lymphatic filariasis (LF) that is prevalent in South Pacific regions. The authors describe how mosquitoes that carry the disease can be genetically modified to carry a bacteria called Wolbachia. The bacteria interfere with the mosquito's ability to transmit the disease to other people. The authors also explain that the genetically modified mosquitoes are compatible with each other but not compatible with mosquitoes that do not carry the bacteria. This means that the genetically modified mosquitoes will breed with each other but not with other mosquitoes in the wild. The authors then explain that when genetically modified males are introduced into the wild, they will breed with wild female mosquitoes and their offspring will be genetically modified as well. This means that over time, the population of mosquitoes will become smaller because the offspring of the genetically modified males are not able to transmit the disease. The authors then explain that this approach has been successful in laboratory studies, but has not yet been tested in the real world. They conclude that this approach has the potential to be a useful addition to current efforts to fight LF in the South Pacific.
This study provides an estimation of the burden of HAT in Tanzania in terms of DALYs, costs to the health services, and costs to individual patients. The study found that HAT imposes a considerable burden on rural communities in Tanzania, and stresses the urgent need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates tailored to particular rural settings in countries like Tanzania where a considerable number of infectious diseases are prevalent and, due to their focal nature, are often concentrated in certain locations where they impose an especially high burden. The study also found that HAT cases are highly focalized, and its burden therefore needs to be considered in relation to the affected localities. The study used a fully stochastic framework run using the @Risk software package ( Palisade , Newfield , NY , USA version 5 . 0 ) , as described in [7] , to calculate the DALY score for T . b . rhodesiense HAT in Urambo , which is situated in Tabora region , which occupies 25 , 995 km2 with a total population of 369 , 329 in 2002 [16] . The predominant ethnic groups are Nyamwezi and Sukuma with some Fipas . Kinyamwezi is the most widely spoken language , although Swahili , the national language , is also used . Subsistence farming is widely practiced , the main crops being tobacco , rice and maize . All the patients included in the present study were diagnosed and treated in Kaliua Health Centre . Three cases were diagnosed during active surveillance activities carried out in Urambo district , which were also referred to Kaliua for treatment . The remaining patients presented passively . Kaliua is a missionary health facility that was selected by the district health authorities to manage all HAT cases in Urambo district , due to its location . It is within the disease catchment area and is easy accessible by train to patients from all affected villages . Information about HAT patients diagnosed and treated in Kaliua between 2000 and 2007 was obtained from hospital records . Patient records were categorized by sex , age cohort , stage of the disease , dates of admission and discharge , initial and final diagnosis; treatment provided ( this was done with the intention of confirming the stage of the disease ) , duration of hospitalization and finally the outcome of the disease . For T . b . rhodesiense , first stage patients ( where the parasite is circulating in the blood and lymph system ) receive Suramin and second stage patients Melarsoprol [17] . It was not possible to obtain disease stage data for 22 of the patients ( as this was not recorded by the care team and further records were unavailable ) . However , all these un-staged patients recovered and were discharged from the hospital . Therefore , using the conservative assumption that there are fewer non drug-related complications and there is no increased non drug-related mortality in the early stage of the disease , the 22 patients were assumed to be early stage . The study found that the total burden of HAT in Urambo District during 2004 was 363 DALYs with 95% confidence interval ranging from 326 to 406 DALYs . The burden was higher for females ( 240 DALYs with 95% confidence interval ranging from 212 to 272 DALYs ) than for males ( 123 DALYs with 95% confidence interval ranging from 97 to 153 DALYs ) . The study also found that the burden of HAT was highest among people aged between 15 and 54 years ( 305 DALYs with 95% confidence interval ranging from 278 to 337 DALYs ) compared to other age groups . The study found that the average cost to the health services per HAT patient was US$ 105 .90 . This was made up of US$ 53.80 for hospitalization ( including surgery , medical procedures and medication ) , US$ 34.20 for diagnosis ( including laboratory tests , surgery and medical procedures ) and US$ 17.90 for drugs . The study also found that the average cost incurred by each patient was US$ 23.50 . This was made up of US$ 8.70 for transportation ( to and from Kaliua Health Centre ) , US$ 4.70 for food ( meals purchased by the patient or his/her relative ) , US$ 4.60 for personal care ( toiletries and clothes purchased by the patient or his/her relative ) and US$ 5.50 for other incidental expenses ( other basic needs that the patient or his/her relative purchased ) . The study concludes that HAT imposes a considerable burden on rural communities in Tanzania, and stresses the urgent need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates tailored to particular rural settings in countries like Tanzania where a considerable number of infectious diseases are prevalent and, due to their focal nature, are often concentrated in certain locations where they impose an especially high burden. The study also concludes that the burden of HAT is highest for people aged between 15 and 54 years and that the burden is higher for females than for males. The study also concludes that the average cost to the health services per HAT patient is US$ 105.90 and that the average cost incurred by each patient is US$ 23.50 .
Ngly1 is a de-N-glycosylase that removes N-glycosylation from proteins. Mutations in the Ngly1 gene cause a human genetic disorder called NGLY1 deficiency syndrome (NDS), which can result in embryonic lethality. To study NDs, we generated Ngly1-deficient mice by targeted gene disruption. We found that Ngly1-deficient mice are embryonic lethal and die around E9.5 due to severe growth restriction. The severity of the growth restriction was comparable to that observed in Ngly1-deficient human embryos. We also found that Ngly1-deficient mice had impaired embryonic development, as evidenced by defects in the neural tube, heart, and forelimbs. In addition, Ngly1-deficient embryos had defective vasculature and high levels of oxidative stress. These defects were not rescued by the addition of Engase, an enzyme that can remove the same type of N-glycosylation as Ngly1. However, when Ngly1-deficient mice were crossed with Engase-deficient mice, the resulting double-knockout embryos were viable, suggesting that Engase is not required for the embryonic development of Ngly1-deficient mice. We also found that the addition of Engase to Ngly1-deficient embryos did not increase their viability. These results suggest that Ngly1 and Engase play distinct roles in embryonic development and that Ngly1-deficient embryos can survive without Engase. Overall, our study provides important insights into the function of Ngly1 in embryonic development and the role of Engase in this process.
The authors investigate the noise generated during gene expression, specifically hunchback (hb) gene expression in Drosophila. They use a stochastic model of hb gene regulation to simulate the noise generated by the hb promoter and compare these simulations to experimental data. They find that the noise generated by hb expression is predominantly due to the stochastic nature of hb protein production. They also find that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter play a role in buffering noise.
Here, we present a new statistical model that allows us to estimate the strength of selection against Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans and its effect on the distribution of Neanderthal ancestry across the genome. Using this approach, we find that the average strength of selection against Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans is s = 1.6%, or equivalently, that the average neutral frequency of the Neanderthal allele that is fixed in Neanderthals ( N1 ) is p0 = 0.06%. We also find that s is significantly lower in East Asians ( s = 0.5%) than in Europeans ( s = 2.3%). Our results provide new insights into the history of human–Neanderthal hybridization and the genetic differences between present-day humans in different parts of the world.
In the HIV-1 LTR, the binding of transcription factors to specific sites leads to either activation or repression of viral gene expression. These factors can interact with each other, and the different rates at which they activate or repress transcription can lead to bimodal distribution of viral gene expression. This bimodal behavior, which we refer to as Phenotypic Bifurcation (PheB), is more likely to occur when the factors promoting repression are not as strong as those promoting activation. This is the case for the two κB and three Sp1 sites in the HIV-1 LTR. We used mutants of these sites to determine the relative importance of each site to viral gene expression and promoter dynamics. The three Sp1 sites contribute to the stabilization of both active and inactive expression states. The two κB sites differentially recruit transcriptional regulators, where κB site I contributes more to transcriptional activation through the recruitment of p50-RelA heterodimer, while κB site II has a bias for the repressing p50-p50 complex. These sites play unique and, at times, synergistic roles in the transcriptional regulation events that underlie gene expression noise and potentially clinical HIV latency.
This study compares different approaches for inferring orthologous groups of genes across multiple genomes. Orthologs are groups of genes that are related by evolution, with each gene being the best match to a gene in another species. Different methods for inferring orthologous relationships have been proposed, including pairwise methods that infer orthologous relationships for each pair of species, and group-based methods that infer orthologous relationships for groups of species. The study compares different methods using a variety of tests, including phylogenetic and functional tests. The results show that different methods perform well in different situations and that there is no clear best method for all cases. The study also provides recommendations for choosing the appropriate method depending on the specific requirements and context of the analysis.
This study presents a novel computational pipeline to predict potential schistosomal kinase targets for drug repurposing, followed by phenotypic screening of the most promising targets. The pipeline combines multi-domain architecture analysis with automated structural modelling to identify protein kinases in S . mansoni that are structurally and functionally similar to human protein kinases. This allowed the identification of 22 potential targets, including previously suggested schistosomicidal agents such as bosutinib , dasatinib , and imatinib as well as newly identified drugs such as vandetanib , saracatinib , tideglusib , alvocidib , dinaciclib . These were then verified ex vivo in an infectious mouse model. The S . japonicum kinome was completed using a combination of homology-based predictions, curation and annotation to identify 132 protein kinases. This allowed the identification of a protein kinase subnetwork that contained key signalling pathways and potential targets for drug repurposing, including six kinases that are part of the TGFβ signalling pathway and are important for parasite development.
Our simulations indicate that the binding of unstructured pKID to KIX occurs via a combined folding-and-binding mechanism. The transition state is characterized by a partly folded pKID structure with a hydrophobic αB helix that is bound to the hydrophobic groove of KIX. We also find that phosphorylation at Ser133 in KID promotes the formation of transient non-specific encounter complexes, which are in agreement with NMR data. The folding-and-binding process is fully consistent with the experimental data, and our simulations help refine the interpretation of NMR data.
The paper you're referring to is a systematic review of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity of infection among children in Latin America and the Caribbean countries. The authors conducted a comprehensive search of medical databases and consulted with experts in the field to find relevant studies. They then extracted data from the studies and analyzed it to identify patterns and trends in schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity of infection among children. The paper includes a detailed description of the methods used to search for and select studies, as well as the data extracted and analyzed. However, to make this information more accessible to a broader audience, it needs to be simplified and presented in a more concise and engaging way.
Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 occurs via a single viral variant, called the founder virus. This variant is selected during transmission through a process that is not yet fully understood. In this study, the authors generated and sequenced near full-length genome infectious molecular clones (IMC) with the env genes from linked recipients and transmitting partners in a common viral backbone. They compared the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of the TF variant to those of the non-transmitted (NT) variants from the transmitting partner. They found a strong selection bias towards consensus sites across the entire genome, at both the amino acid and nucleotide level, in all six pairs. The TF variants were also more sensitive to neutralization by donor antibodies than the NT variants. However, no evidence was found for TF variants exhibiting increased particle infectivity, replicative capacity, or IFN-α resistance when compared to the transmitting partner’s NT variants. Thus, in these six subtype C transmission pairs, the transmission potential of TF variants is not discriminated by inherent in vitro replicative capacity or interferon resistance, and may be determined by alternate phenotypes difficult to dissect in these in vitro systems.
Lymphedema is a serious complication of filarial infections, resulting in chronic swelling of the limbs. The study examines the effects of filarial antigens and live parasites on human lymphatic endothelial cells. It finds that filarial antigens and live parasites cause LEC to proliferate and differentiate into tube-like structures, which involves matrix metalloproteases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteases. It also finds that filarial parasites render lymphatics less permeable. The study suggests that filarial parasites may promote lymphangiogenesis, a process that involves lymphatic endothelial proliferation and differentiation.
The author describes a method to amplify and sequence the genomes of single E. coli bacteria using multiple displacement amplification (MDA) in microfluidic devices. The author explains that MDA is a technique that amplifies the DNA of a single cell by displacing the DNA strands from each other, creating new DNA molecules. The author also describes the use of micromanipulation to isolate single E. coli cells from a suspension of cells. The author explains that the amplified DNA is then sequenced using a combination of rolling circle amplification and emulsion PCR. The author concludes that the method is highly specific, with low amplification bias and high throughput.
In this study, the authors present a detailed analysis of the distribution of small mammal species in the Atlantic Forest of South America, with a focus on potential hantavirus hosts. They used geographically weighted regression models to examine the influence of a variety of environmental, geographical, and biological factors on the abundance of these species. The authors found that land use patterns, defaunation intensity, rainfall, and habitat diversity all had significant effects on the abundance of small mammal species in the Atlantic Forest. They also found that hantavirus hosts, such as Akodon montensis and Calomys laucha, were more abundant in areas with higher defaunation intensity and in areas with more agricultural land use. Overall, the study provides important insights into the complex factors that influence the distribution of small mammal species in the Atlantic Forest and highlights the need for more research on the potential impacts of land use and defaunation on hantavirus transmission.
The cell death process known as apoptosis is regulated by a group of proteins called the BCL-2 family. In particular, the BAX and BAK proteins are pro-apoptotic, meaning they promote cell death, and their levels determine whether a cell will survive or die. In this study, we have demonstrated that the JEV virus triggers the downregulation of BCL-XL in hepatoma cells, which in turn promotes the upregulation and activation of BAX and BAK. This results in increased apoptosis of infected cells, providing a new therapeutic target for the treatment of JEV infection.
The paper you have provided is a study that estimated the economic burden of canine rabies in Vietnam over a ten year period ( 2005–2014 ). The study considered both direct and indirect costs of rabies in dogs , livestock , and humans . These costs were estimated through data collection from personal interviews , published literature , published and supplementary reports , and primary data collection. The study found that the total economic impact of canine rabies in Vietnam was over $719 million USD. The largest portion of impacts ( 92% ) were made up of PEP-related costs. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75 USD. This study indicates that canine rabies impacts in Vietnam are consistent with the burden elsewhere reported in Asia, with large expenditures on PEP and very small investments in dog vaccination.
In this study, the authors characterize the components of the T2SS in EPEC. They find that the T2SS secretin is dependent on a distinct class of pilotin, rather than the PulS-OutS family of pilotins that are commonly used by bacteria. Specifically, they find that the T2SS secretin GspD from EPEC is dependent on the AspS pilotin. They also find that the S-domain of the T2SS secretin varies between organisms that use the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type secretins. They suggest that the EPEC T2SS depends on a distinct class of secretin, which requires a distinct class of pilotin, and that these secretins and pilotins can be distinguished by S-domain sequence and structural analysis.
Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by pathogenic Leptospira serovars. In this study, the authors identified an elastin-binding protein, OmpL37, in pathogenic Leptospira serovars. OmpL37 was purified and found to have high affinity for soluble human skin elastin and aorta elastin. The authors used ELISA to show that OmpL37 binds to elastin in a saturable manner and that anti-OmpL37 antibodies inhibit leptospiral binding to elastin. The authors also used immunoblotting to show that OmpL37 is recognized by antibodies raised against Leptospira-infected hamsters and acute and convalescent leptospirosis patients. OmpL37 was also found to be detectable in L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni strain Fiocruz L1-130, L. kirschneri serovar Mazdok strain 5621, and L. borgpetersenii serovar Tarrasovi strain Perepelicin, but not in L. borgpetersenii serovar Javanica strain Veldrat Bataviae 46, L. inadai serovar Lyme strain 10, or L. wolbachii serovar Biflexa strain codice. The authors suggest that OmpL37 may play a role in the attachment of Leptospira to elastin-rich tissues such as the dermis and vasculature.
In this study, we present a model to calculate the probability of neutralization of HIV-1 by two broadly neutralizing antibodies, 4E10 and 2F5, at different concentrations. These antibodies are polyreactive, meaning they can bind to the viral membrane and their epitopes in the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of gp41. We find that the effectiveness of these antibodies at neutralization depends on the time to disable an epitope, which must be shorter than the time the antibody remains bound in the conformational change, about five minutes or less. We also find that 2F5 is much more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment, while 4E10 is not. We attribute this to 2F5 interacting more stably than 4E10 with the viral membrane. We use the model to elucidate the parameters that determine the ability of these antibodies to disable epitopes and propose an extension of the model to analyze neutralization data. We find that only a small number of gp41 bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion, and that at the start of the pre-hairpin intermediate, only a few gp41 trimers are involved in bridging the virion and target cell.
The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of mass drug treatment with ivermectin in interrupting transmission of onchocerciasis and eliminating the disease in endemic areas in West Africa. The study involved three river basins in Mali and Senegal where onchocerciasis is endemic due to the presence of highly efficient vectors. The study was conducted in three phases. In phase 1, skin snip surveys and entomological surveys were conducted in selected villages in each of the three river basins to determine infection and transmission levels after 14-17 years of treatment. If infection and transmission levels were below predefined thresholds, phase 2 would begin in which treatment would be stopped in a test area of 5-8 villages and infection and transmission levels monitored for 20-22 months. If there was no recrudescence of infection and transmission in the test area, phase 3 would begin in which treatment would be stopped throughout the study site and infection and transmission monitored for another 2 years. The study found that in the R. Bakoye and R. Gambia river basins, infection and transmission levels had fallen to very low levels after 15-17 years of treatment and remained below the predefined thresholds for 2 years after treatment was stopped. In the R. Faleme river basin, infection and transmission levels were not as low as in the other two river basins but were still below the predefined thresholds after 3 years of follow-up evaluation after treatment was stopped. The study concludes that mass drug treatment with ivermectin can interrupt onchocerciasis transmission in highly endemic areas in West Africa and that treatment can be safely stopped when infection and transmission levels fall below predefined thresholds.
We previously showed that recombinant VP4 induced permeability in model membranes [18] . In the present study , we have produced recombinant VP4 with a minimal tag and shown that VP4 induced membrane permeability is mediated by the formation of a homo-multimeric , size-selective membrane pore . We also present evidence that the membrane pore is formed by the N-terminal region of the VP1 protein as part of the interaction between virus and membranes .
In this study, the authors identify three enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lipid A in Francisella tularensis, a pathogenic bacterium that causes the disease tularemia. The authors used transposon mutagenesis to screen for mutants with altered lipid A structures, and then characterized the resulting mutations. They found that the flmF2 and flmK mutants had reduced virulence in mice, and that the flmK mutant induced protective immunity. The authors propose that the reduced virulence and induction of protective immunity by these mutants is due to increased activation of the innate immune system.
The function of Era, a Ribosomal GTPase Enzyme A (RGEA), has been determined in Staphylococcus aureus. Era is involved in the formation of 30S subunits, and is required for the growth of S. aureus at low temperatures. It interacts with the 16S rRNA and the endonuclease YbeY, and affects the maturation of the 16S rRNA.
Anthrax toxin, which is a deadly combination of two proteins, is very harmful to humans and animals. In this study, the authors investigated how neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) affects the body's response to anthrax toxin. They found that nNOS-deficient mice were much more sensitive to anthrax toxin than mice with normal nNOS levels. This sensitivity was not due to differences in the sensitivity of their macrophages (a type of white blood cell) to the toxin, or to differences in their immune response to the toxin. The authors found that anthrax toxin caused rapid and severe damage to the hearts of both nNOS-deficient and nNOS-sufficient mice, but that nNOS-deficient mice were more affected. They also found that nNOS-deficient mice had higher levels of heart damage markers in their blood, indicating that their hearts were more injured. The authors suggest that nNOS may help protect the heart from anthrax toxin-induced damage.
We have successfully utilized CRISPR/Cas9 technology to target the Ss-unc-22 gene in Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasitic nematode that causes intestinal infections in humans and animals. This is the first time that CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to target the genome of this parasite. We have also developed a new strategy to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 components into the gonads of S. stercoralis, allowing us to target its germline and generate heritable mutations in its offspring. Using this strategy, we have successfully targeted and disrupted the Ss-unc-22 gene in the parasite's germline, generating mutant offspring. We have also used our new strategy to create a marker for the identification of mutant offspring, which will be useful for the study of other S. stercoralis genes. These findings open the door to the study of the biology and pathogenesis of S. stercoralis using genetic tools, which will be critical for the development of new strategies for the control of this parasite.
This paper presents a mathematical model that explains how ribosome drop-off affects the efficiency of protein expression. Ribosome drop-off occurs when a ribosome detaches from the mRNA template before it completes translation. This can happen due to a variety of factors, such as amino acid starvation or the depletion of tRNA. The model introduced in this paper describes how ribosome drop-off affects the translation rate of individual mRNAs. The authors show that ribosome drop-off can result in non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, in which the ribosome density increases from the 5' to the 3' end of the mRNA. They also show that the effects of ribosome drop-off on the translation rate are mRNA-specific, and that mRNAs that present ribosome queues are much less affected by ribosome drop-off than those that do not. The authors also show that, among mRNAs that do not present ribosome queues, resilience to drop-off correlates positively with the elongation rate, so that sequences using fast codons are expected to be less affected by ribosome drop-off. Finally, the authors use their model to show that ribosome drop-off can have important implications for protein expression, especially in physiological and stress situations.
The article is about the DeWorm3 trial, which investigates the possibility of interrupting soil-transmitted helminth (STH) transmission. The trial involves two arms, a control arm and an intervention arm, with different treatment strategies. The article discusses the feasibility of using mathematical models to predict the likelihood of transmission interruption and the need for high treatment coverage levels to achieve this. The article also discusses the challenges of achieving high treatment coverage levels in adults and the importance of determining whether transmission interruption is unlikely at early stages of the trial. The article provides an overview of the DeWorm3 trial and the individual-based stochastic model used to simulate events in the trial. It also discusses the importance of using models to predict the likelihood of transmission interruption and the need for high treatment coverage levels to achieve this. The article also discusses the challenges of achieving high treatment coverage levels in adults and the importance of determining whether transmission interruption is unlikely at early stages of the trial.
Researchers have successfully developed a conjugate vaccine made from the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) Ogawa and the tetanus toxoid carrier protein. They demonstrated that the conjugate vaccine induces a protective immune response against V. cholerae in mice. The study provides evidence for the development of a conjugate vaccine against cholera, which is an important public health problem worldwide.
This article describes a method for studying the interaction between the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the opportunistic yeast Candida albicans in the context of host immunodeficiency. The authors have developed a novel murine model of P. aeruginosa-C. albicans coinfection, in which they are able to specifically deplete immunocompetent neutrophils, while maintaining immunosuppression by the use of antibiotics. The authors have found that P. aeruginosa is able to colonize the intestinal tract of these neutropenic mice without any signs of inflammation or intestinal damage, suggesting that the lack of immune response is allowing the bacteria to establish a chronic infection. The authors also show that P. aeruginosa is able to produce a metalloprotease, which can degrade extracellular matrix components, and that this protease contributes to P. aeruginosa's ability to colonize the intestines of neutropenic mice. The authors suggest that this protease may be an important virulence factor for P. aeruginosa in the context of immunocompromised hosts.
We have studied how the immune escape mutation K165R in the KP9 epitope of HIV-1 and SIV-1 viruses revert to the wild-type (WT) sequence when mixed with WT virus in different proportions. The reversion rate is highly variable and is associated with the outcome of infection. We used sensitive qRT-PCR assays to quantify the WT and EM variants in vivo and found that reversion is more rapid when the proportion of EM virus is lower. This is because the presence of WT virus gives the EM virus a growth advantage, making it harder for the EM virus to revert to WT. We also found that higher levels of EM virus at the KP9 epitope are associated with lower viral loads, suggesting that delayed reversion to WT in this epitope may contribute to better control of the virus. Our results highlight the importance of the initial proportion of WT and EM virus in determining the dynamics of reversion and the viral loads that result. This information can be used to design more effective vaccines and preventive strategies that target immune escape mutations.
The PCA1 gene of some S. cerevisiae strains has evolved to confer a cadmium resistance phenotype by changing the PCA1 promoter region. This phenotype has been maintained through selection, even though the PCA1 coding region has experienced deleterious mutations that have reduced the cadmium-efflux activity of PCA1. PCA1 in these strains has not been adapted to the current cadmium level in the environment. Instead, it has evolved to a stable cadmium-tolerant state, which is maintained under various environmental conditions.
In this study, the authors present a comprehensive analysis of the activation status of 11 oncogenic pathways in gastric cancer, a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Using gene expression data from 301 primary gastric cancers and 25 gastric cancer cell lines, the authors developed an in silico method to map the activity of multiple oncogenic pathways simultaneously in primary tumors. They identified three oncogenic pathways (proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin) that were deregulated in the vast majority (over 70%) of gastric cancers, and functionally validated the pathway predictions in vitro using a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. The authors also showed that patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations (e.g. high proliferation/high NF-κB vs. low proliferation/low NF-κB) showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple independent patient cohorts, suggesting a critical role for pathway combinations in influencing GC clinical behavior. Their results demonstrate that GCs can be successfully taxonomized using oncogenic pathway activity into biologically, functionally, and clinically relevant subtypes. This pathway-centric strategy provides a novel approach to identifying biologically meaningful subtypes of cancer, which could lead to more personalized and effective treatments in the future.
In this study, the authors use a computational approach to analyze the relationship between strong SIDD sites, which are sites in the DNA that are destabilized under stress conditions, and the function of genes. They use the E. coli K12 genome as an example and show that strong SIDD sites are more likely to occur in the 5' flanks of genes that encode transcriptional regulators. They also find that the genes that directly respond to physiological and environmental stimuli have a higher probability of having strong SIDD sites in their 5' flanks. The authors suggest that strong SIDD sites are active and necessary participants in the regulatory mechanisms governing changes in the global pattern of gene expression in prokaryotes.
Our previous study identified a total of twelve HMG-box genes in the fungus P. anserina and found that six of them are dispensable for vegetative growth and sexual reproduction. Here, we found that the dispensable HMG-box genes could be grouped into two major clades based on the phylogenetic analysis, with four genes falling into the M-HMG-box clade and two genes falling into the HMG-box1 clade. However, we did not find any genes belonging to the HMG-box2 clade in P. anserina. The expression of the HMG-box genes was differentially regulated during vegetative growth and sexual reproduction, with the expression of HMG-box1 genes being upregulated during sexual reproduction. Interestingly, we found that a HMG-box protein could form a complex with a MAT-alpha2 transcription factor to regulate the transcription of FPR1 and FMR1, two important genes involved in sexual reproduction in P. anserina. Furthermore, we found that a HMG-box protein was required for normal fertilization efficiency. These results suggest that HMG-box genes play an important role in the regulation of sexual reproduction in P. anserina.
This study aimed to investigate the persistence of Ebola virus in body fluids of Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors in Sierra Leone. The study was conducted in two phases, with the first phase focusing on semen and the second phase on a range of other body fluids, including vaginal fluid, menstrual blood, breast milk, rectal fluid, sweat and saliva. Participants were recruited through community engagement and sensitization sessions, and were compensated for their time and transport costs. Specimens were collected in compliance with international and national regulations, and tested for the presence of Ebola virus using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The study aimed to provide evidence to guide policies on sexual health and practices, and to inform recommendations for testing and surveillance of EVD survivors.
Chemical gradients are essential for the survival of bacteria in their natural environment. In this study, we used experimental data from Escherichia coli (E. coli) to predict the chemical gradients that these bacteria typically encounter. We reevaluated the Weber-Fechner law and other related laws to obtain a full distribution of the gradients. We used information theory to predict the optimal response of E. coli to different chemical gradients. By simulating the behavior of E. coli, we showed that the bacteria migrate most efficiently in gradients of a chemical called aspartate. Our study provides a first step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible microenvironments, such as the human intestine.
The human body is constantly producing new blood cells from a small number of stem cells, which are found in the bone marrow. Scientists have known for some time that these stem cells are functionally defined by their multi-potency and self-renewal capacity. However, it wasn't clear whether these genetically identical stem cells differed in their lifespan or whether they had the same lifespan, which was thought to be predetermined. In this study, the researchers used a new mathematical model based on reliability theory to account for the diversity of lifespans of HSCs. They analyzed the failure kinetics of clonal repopulation experiments and found that HSCs have anti-persistent behavior, which means that they have short bursts of proliferation followed by periods of rest. This is important because the time between these bursts of proliferation determines the lifespan of the HSCs. The researchers also showed that the lifespan of each HSC depends on the amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in the failure rate kinetics. Their findings suggest that the lifespan of HSCs is determined by preprogrammed differences in repair capacity. The results of this study could have important implications for understanding the maintenance of blood cell production and the development of new therapeutic approaches for treating blood disorders.
Our study uncovered a novel mechanism of antibody-mediated immunity against helminth infections. We found that antibodies against parasite antigens induce the rapid trapping of tissue migrating larvae and prevent tissue necrosis following challenge infections. Mice lacking antibodies or activating Fc receptors harbored highly motile larvae, developed extensive tissue damage, and accumulated less Arginase-1 expressing macrophages around the larvae. Moreover, we found that Hp-specific antibodies induced FcRγ- and complement-dependent adherence of macrophages to larvae in vitro, resulting in complete larval immobilization. In vitro and in vivo, Hp-specific antibodies induced Arg1 expression in macrophages independently of IL-4Rα signaling. These findings suggest a new role for antibodies in the protection against helminth infections, beyond their ability to neutralize or opsonize parasites.
Researchers have developed a new method to visualize and track the movement of chromatin during DNA repair in living yeast cells. They used a protein called ParB that binds to specific DNA sequences and recruits other proteins to form a fluorescent focus. By observing the movement of this fluorescent focus over time, they were able to track the dynamics of DNA repair and identify a new stage of chromatin rearrangement that occurs early in the repair process. This new method will enable researchers to better understand the mechanisms of DNA repair and to identify new targets for therapeutic interventions.
The article describes a model that simulates the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease, in rural villages in Argentina. The model is designed to estimate the rate of re-inoculation in humans, as well as the frequency of reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease, according to different hypotheses about the adaptive immune response following a primary infection. The model is based on a stochastic agent-based approach, which involves simulating individual agents (humans and bugs) and their interactions in an environment. The model is fitted to epidemiological data from two rural settlements in the Chaco Province of Argentina, and the results suggest that re-inoculations occur at a low rate, on the order of 0.032 per year, with most of them occurring in the chronic phase of the disease. The model also predicts that reinfections can cause mixed infections, where more than one lineage of T. cruzi is present in the same individual. The authors suggest that further research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the factors that contribute to reinfections and their impact on the progression of Chagas disease.
Scientists have found that people who experience a subclinical dengue infection (a mild infection or no infection at all) have a higher level of certain types of antibodies than those who experience a severe infection. This discovery could help researchers develop better ways to predict which types of dengue infections someone might develop.
The Drosophila wing disc is a structure that develops into the wing of a fruit fly. During development, the wing disc is divided into two compartments: anterior (A) and posterior (P). The cells in the P compartment secrete Hedgehog (Hh) protein, which forms a gradient that runs from the P to the A compartment. Hh regulates gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner. It has been shown that Hh signaling is responsible for the formation of multiple distinct domains of gene expression in the A compartment. However, it has not been demonstrated that the borders of these domains correspond exactly to Hh concentration thresholds. In this study, the authors use mathematical modeling to analyze the relationship between Hh concentration and gene expression. They found that, at steady state, the borders of the domains cannot be clearly defined in response to Hh concentration. The authors suggest that this is because Hh signaling is not only determined by the concentration of Hh, but also by the feedback regulation of Hh receptor (Ptc). They propose that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. The authors also conducted experiments to test their hypothesis. They found that Hh signaling depends on the history of exposure to Hh and that a single Hh concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. The authors suggest that the feedback regulation of Ptc plays an important role in the establishment of patterns of gene expression.
The Lwt/Lwt mutation in the C. elegans unc-79 gene causes a novel locomotor phenotype, "Lightweight." Lightweight mutants are smaller and have reduced body fat compared to wild-type worms. They also have reduced sensitivity to ethanol, as measured by ethanol-induced loss of righting reflex and duration of ethanol intoxication. The Lightweight mutant has a reduced number of dopaminergic neurons and dopaminergic neurites. Dopamine levels are reduced in the brain of Lightweight mutants, while levels of the dopamine metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, are increased. Lightweight mutants have a reduced number of synaptic boutons in dopaminergic neurons, but no change in synapse number in non-dopaminergic neurons. The Lightweight mutant also has reduced locomotor activity in response to ethanol, as measured by distance traveled and activity rate.
The study showed that the Imd pathway, a conserved immune signaling pathway that has potent anti-P . falciparum activity, is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage. The study also showed that caspar silencing alone is sufficient to induce a robust anti-P . falciparum response even in the relative absence of resident gut microbiota. The study highlights the physiological considerations that are integral to a thoughtful implementation of Imd pathway manipulation in A . gambiae as part of an effort to limit the malaria transmission cycle. The study reveals a variety of previously unrecognized nuances in the Imd-directed immune response against P . falciparum.
Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. However, the anti-fibrotic properties of these cells have not been evaluated in an animal model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by the fungal pathogen Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. In this study, we evaluated the effect of late infusion of BMMSCs on pulmonary fibrosis induced by P. brasiliensis in an in vivo experimental model of PCM. Our findings indicated that late infusion of BMMSCs did not have any anti-fibrotic effect, as an exacerbated fibrotic process was observed.
The Mediterranean region is currently experiencing a geographical expansion of Leishmania infantum vectors towards northern latitudes and higher altitudes, which is predicted to have an impact on leishmaniasis transmission. This study aimed to investigate the seasonal dynamics of Mediterranean sand fly species that are competent to transmit L. infantum in order to provide a baseline for continuing investigations on possible changes that may have an impact on leishmaniasis transmission. The study was carried out in 8 countries in the Mediterranean region (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, and Georgia) over a period of 4 years (2011–2014). Collections were performed using CDC light traps with fine mesh cage, with a total of 94 traps operating 1–2 hours before sunset until 1–2 hours after sunrise. Sticky traps were also used complementary to light traps in most of the sites surveyed. Sand flies were identified morphologically or by molecular methods. The study showed that the activity period of Mediterranean vectors is typically seasonal, and that it varies among species and countries. The study provides a practical graphic format of phenological and abundance parameters that may have an impact on leishmaniasis transmission by relevant vector species in each endemic setting and the whole subregion.
This paper describes the discovery of novel genes involved in host immune responses to O. tsutsugamushi infection. In particular, the authors describe how microarray analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes in monocytes infected with O. tsutsugamushi. The results suggest that O. tsutsugamushi infection induces pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production, type I interferon responses, and apoptosis. These findings may help to elucidate the pathogenesis of scrub typhus and to identify potential targets for new therapies.
In this paper, we present a model of how ants might store visual memories to navigate their environments. We use a spiking neural network to simulate how a cataglyphis ant might learn to distinguish its home from other locations by storing images of views along its route home. We train the network using images taken from real ant routes and use a simple algorithm to determine whether a novel image is more similar to a previously learnt image or not. We find that the network can store up to 100,000 images and distinguish them with high accuracy even when the images are highly correlated. We also show how the network can generalize to new images that it has not seen before, and how it can distinguish between different routes even when they are very similar.
This study investigated the abscission of cauline leaves in Arabidopsis in response to bacterial infection. Cauline leaves were found to abscise in response to infection with Pseudomonas syringae strain DC3000, and this response was dependent on the salicylic acid signaling pathway. The abscission response was triggered by the recognition of bacterial effectors by plant immune receptors, leading to the activation of a MAPK cascade that ultimately regulated the expression of abscission receptor genes. This study provides insight into the mechanism of cauline leaf abscission in response to bacterial infection and the role of salicylic acid signaling in this process.
In this study, the authors investigated the spatial and temporal properties of dendritic Ca2+ responses in starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina of mice. They found that dendritic Ca2+ responses are influenced by the direction of motion in stimuli, and that this response can be explained by the presence of an electrical dipole in SACs. The authors also found that dendritic Ca2+ responses are independent of synaptic inputs and that they can be reliably evoked by visual stimuli. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of dendritic Ca2+ responses in SACs.
The study examined the relationship between the infective dose of pathogens, their mode of action, and their virulence. The study found that pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators have significantly higher infective doses than pathogens with locally acting molecules. This finding supports the hypothesis that local pathogenic action requires only a small number of molecules, and hence relatively few cells are needed to start an infection, compared to distantly acting mechanisms. The study also found no significant relationship between case fatality rate or severity of infection and the mechanism of pathogenesis. However, case fatality rate was significantly negatively related to infective dose of pathogens. The authors suggest this correlation arises because for a given dose, pathogens that are locally acting and have lower infective doses are more likely to establish an infection. They also suggest that the actual dose in natural infections is largely determined by factors such as mode of transmission. The study also found that pathogens infecting hosts through wounded skin result in significantly higher case fatality rates than pathogens inhaled or ingested. This result supports theory on virulence-transmission trade-offs which proposes that vectors and water systems circumvent the need for an ambulatory host to transmit pathogens, selecting for the evolution of higher virulence. The study emphasises the importance of life-history or mechanistic details for the evolution of parasite traits.
We identify a role for the sma-miR-277/4989 family of microRNAs in the sexual maturation of schistosomes. We show that the majority of the sma-miR-277/4989 family targets transcription factors, molecules involved in transcriptional activation/repression and signalling, and molecules associated with adult stem-cell maintenance. This family of microRNAs is highly expressed in adult worms, suggesting a role in sexual maturation and reproduction. The transcriptional and translational regulation of target molecules is consistent with a role for sma-miR-277/4989 in sexual maturation. We show that the majority of the sma-miR-277/4989 family targets are differentially expressed between mature, sexually active females and immature “virgin” females, suggesting a role in sexual reproduction.
The study was conducted to identify and characterize SARS-CoVs in bats in a specific cave in China. 15 SARS-CoVs were detected from fecal samples of 12 bat species, including seven species of the family Rhinolophidae and five species of the family Hipposideridae. All the detected SARS-CoVs were distantly related to known SARS-CoVs. The genetic diversity among bat SARS-CoVs was high. The study also investigated the evolutionary relationships of bat SARS-CoVs and human SARS-CoVs using phylogenetic analysis. The results suggested that the bat SARS-CoVs were not the direct ancestor of human SARS-CoVs, but the common ancestor of both human and civet SARS-CoVs. This study provides valuable information for understanding the origin of human SARS-CoVs and the zoonotic transmission of this virus.
The article describes how the method used to determine the effectiveness of anthelmintic drugs for treating soil-transmitted helminth infections in humans may be affected by the phenomenon of density-dependent fecundity. This phenomenon occurs when the number of eggs laid by a parasite decreases as the number of parasites present in the host body increases. The article suggests that the use of the faecal egg count reduction test, which measures the reduction in the number of eggs found in a person's faeces after treatment with anthelmintic drugs, may be affected by this phenomenon. The article provides examples of recent research that supports the existence of density-dependent fecundity in human soil-transmitted helminths, and suggests that this phenomenon may result in the underestimation of drug efficacy.
The branching of the lung is a developmental process that results in the formation of the airways and the gas exchange units of the lung. A key player in this process is the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS), which is produced by the glycosytransferase exostosin (EXT1). A study using mice with a mutation in the EXT1 gene showed that this mutation led to an expansion of the branching tips and a reduction in the number of branches in the developing lung. This was associated with several mesenchymal developmental defects. The study also demonstrated an expansion of the Fgf10 expression and an increase in the FGF signaling activity in the mutant lungs. Furthermore, reduced levels of SHH signaling were observed in the mutant lung epithelium and surrounding wild-type mesenchyme. The reduced SHH signaling activity did not appear to be caused by decreased Shh expression or protein stability, but by a reduction in the biologically active form of SHH. The study highlights the role of HS in regulating SHH signaling, which is critical for lung morphogenesis.
Here is a lay summary of the provided content: The paper provides a theoretical and experimental analysis of the probability of detecting a fusion gene in cancer through the use of paired-end sequencing technology. The authors first derive a formula for the probability of a fusion gene being detected given a set of clones that are end-sequenced from a tumor sample. They then extend this formula to consider the probability of detecting multiple fusion genes and the probability of a fusion gene being detected with high confidence. The authors also provide a method for efficiently computing the probability of detecting a fusion gene given a set of clones. Finally, the authors test their theoretical predictions by performing paired-end sequencing of a breast cancer cell line and validating the detected fusions through sequencing and cloning.
The article "Excitable networks and gradients: a chemoattractant-driven model for the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum" presents a mathematical model of cellular movement, including the processes of chemotaxis, motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. The model includes two modules: the LEGI module, which describes the activity of the receptor-regulator system, and the polarization module, which describes how cells acquire and maintain their polarity. The authors used the model to simulate the movement of cells in response to a gradient of chemoattractant, and they found that the model predicted the directional movement of cells in response to a chemoattractant gradient. The authors also tested the model by comparing its predictions to experimental data, and they found that the model accurately predicted the behavior of cells in response to a chemoattractant gradient. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive overview of the cellular processes involved in chemotaxis and the mathematical framework for modeling these processes.
Here, the authors report that TDRD6, a male germ line-specific protein essential for chromatoid body (ChB) structure and elongated spermatid development, interacts with the key protein arginine methyl transferase PRMT5 in meiotic prophase I spermatocytes. This interaction is required for spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes. Loss of TDRD6 results in reduced SmB and PRMT5 association, abnormal spliceosome formation, and increased U5 snRNP levels. The authors also found that TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes exhibit decreased numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies involved in nuclear snRNP maturation. These findings suggest a novel function of TDRD6 in spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in prophase I spermatocytes.
The paper presents a novel method for inferring whether multiple genomic samples are derived from the same strain of bacteria using a continuous-time Wright-Fisher (W-F) simulation model. The method involves a Bayesian mixture model that allows for differentiation between two hypotheses: that the samples are derived from the same strain and that they are derived from different strains. The model takes into account the acquisition times of the samples and estimates the effective population size and mutation rate from the within-population variation in the samples. The model is evaluated using simulated data and data from MSSA-acquired MRSA samples. The paper also describes a Gibbs sampler algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution of the model parameters and a special algorithm for the Metropolis-within-Gibbs step. The paper concludes with an example application of the method to a dataset of eight MSSA-acquired MRSA samples, showing that the method can distinguish between the two hypotheses with high accuracy. The paper also discusses the limitations of the method and suggests areas for future work.
Plants make new parts by using special cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) creates leaves, flowers, and lateral meristems in a pattern called phyllotaxis. Researchers think that the auxin hormone plays a big role in this pattern. They have two main ideas about how auxin works: the canalization hypothesis and the concentration-based hypothesis. The canalization hypothesis says that auxin flows in specific pathways and these pathways amplify the flow. The concentration-based hypothesis says that cells near places with high auxin levels create more auxin transporters and this creates more flow. Researchers used computer simulations to test both ideas and found that the canalization hypothesis explained auxin transport in the SAM better than the concentration-based hypothesis. They also made some predictions that can be tested in real plants.
This is a very important paper for my career. You'd better be sure. The study aimed to identify a diagnostic biomarker for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania donovani that affects the internal organs and can lead to death if left untreated. The researchers used genomic and computational tools to identify proteins recognized by IgG1 antibodies in the serum of patients with VL. They then used peptide arrays to screen a large number of candidate peptides and identified one that was specific to VL patients. The peptide was then incorporated into prototype rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) and tested in a small sample size. The results showed promising sensitivity and specificity of the peptide-based RDTs, supporting the proof of concept strategy for diagnostics discovery.
Researchers recently looked at the frequency of caseating granulomas in a large group of people (317) with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from different parts of the world (Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Ethiopia, and Iran). The researchers looked at clinical and microscopic information, including type of granuloma, to determine the incidence of caseating granulomas in CL. The study found that 18.2% of all CL cases had caseating granulomas. The researchers suggest that CL should be considered part of the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions. The results of this study may help improve the diagnosis of CL in both endemic and nonendemic regions.
The present study reports the identification of a candidate gene for the diabetogenic effect of a QTL ( Nidd/SJL , Nidd1 ) contributed by the SJL , NON , and NZB strains in outcross populations with New Zealand Obese ( NZO ) mice. This diabetic QTL was previously identified as a major susceptibility locus for hyperglycaemia and diabetes in obese mouse strains. A critical interval of distal chromosome 4 was identified by interval-specific congenic introgression of SJL into diabetes-resistant C57BL/6J , and subsequent reporter cross with NZO. Analysis of the 10 genes in the critical interval by sequencing, qRT–PCR, and RACE–PCR revealed a striking allelic variance of Zfp69 encoding zinc finger domain transcription factor 69. In NZO and C57BL/6J , a retrotransposon ( IAPLTR1a ) in intron 3 disrupted the gene by formation of a truncated mRNA that lacked the coding sequence for the KRAB ( Krüppel-associated box ) and Znf-C2H2 domains of Zfp69 , whereas the diabetogenic SJL , NON , and NZB alleles generated a normal mRNA. When combined with the B6 . V-Lepob background , the diabetogenic Zfp69SJL allele produced hyperglycaemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma and liver triglycerides. mRNA levels of the human orthologue of Zfp69 , ZNF642 , were significantly increased in adipose tissue from patients with type 2 diabetes. The study suggests that Zfp69 is the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL , and that retrotransposon IAPLTR1a contributes substantially to the genetic heterogeneity of mouse strains. Expression of the transcription factor in adipose tissue may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
The paper presents a comprehensive logical model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation. The authors have integrated and formalized a large set of documented molecular interactions and components, and used an original reduction approach together with a stable state identification algorithm to perform extensive dynamical analyses. The model has been validated through a series of simulations, considering various prototypic local environments. The authors have identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th subtypes, but also coexisting hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg, and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. They have used the logical model to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico, to identify crucial regulatory structures, and to predict the behaviour of differentiated cells in diverse local environments.
The authors developed a statistical model to predict transcription factor binding based on the factor concentration and the underlying DNA sequence. They used ChIP-seq data for five transcription factors in early stage 5 Drosophila embryos, and implemented a generalized hidden Markov model to quantify the contribution of different biophysical forces in the binding of transcription factors. They compared their predictions to in vivo binding data, and found that DNA sequence specificity can be predicted almost exclusively by the sequence specificity of individual factors, with a minimal role for protein interactions. They suggest that a combination of experimentally determined chromatin accessibility data and simple computational models of transcription factor binding may be used to predict the binding landscape of any animal transcription factor with significant precision.
The article "Shaping development through transcriptional regulation: the control of cell proliferation by the Drosophila E-protein family" provides a comprehensive overview of the E-protein family in Drosophila and its role in controlling cell proliferation. The authors discuss the different E-proteins and their homologues, as well as their roles in controlling cell cycle progression. They also explore the mechanisms by which the E-proteins regulate transcription, including their ability to bind DNA and interact with other transcription factors. Additionally, the authors discuss the recent advances in understanding the role of the E-protein family in development, including their roles in stem cell maintenance, neurogenesis, and organ morphogenesis. Overall, this article provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in understanding the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and their role in development.
A comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline was proposed to discover key proteins in specific pathways and protein-protein interactions involved in the filamentous growth transition of yeast. This pipeline used phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery, and was applied to interventional experiments of yeast kinases involved in filamentous growth. Nine proteins were identified as candidate proteins by both phosphopeptide meta-analysis and correlation network analysis, and all of them were involved in stress responses. Four of these proteins were tested by interventional phenotypic experiments, and all of them presented differential invasive growth. This study suggests a systematic way for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can help guide future studies.
Sex chromosomes are genetic elements that determine the sex of an organism. In some animals, there are two types of sex chromosomes, called X and Y. In Drosophila, the fruit fly, X and Y chromosomes have evolved independently and have different properties. One of the most interesting properties of Drosophila sex chromosomes is that the X chromosome carries many more genes than the Y chromosome. This difference in gene content has led to the evolution of two different mechanisms to compensate for the unequal number of genes: one in males and one in females. In males, this mechanism is called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which involves the silencing of the Y chromosome during meiosis, the specialized cell division that produces sperm and eggs. In females, this mechanism is called dosage compensation, which involves the equalization of the number of copies of genes between the X chromosome and the autosomes (chromosomes that are not sex chromosomes). In this study, the authors used a combination of new and existing data to study the regulation of the Drosophila X chromosome in the male germline. They found that the X chromosome does not appear to undergo dosage compensation in the Drosophila male germline, and they did not find evidence for MSCI. Instead, they found that the sperm-specific ocnus transgenes show much lower expression when X-linked versus autosomal, and this chromosomal difference is established early in premeiotic cells. Overall, this study provides new insights into the regulation of the Drosophila X chromosome in the male germline and has implications for patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.
E. coli is a major human pathogen that causes a variety of infections, including food poisoning, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections. To study the pathogenesis of E. coli, researchers often use laboratory models such as mice or cell lines. However, these models may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of human E. coli infections. To address this, researchers from the University of Bern in Switzerland have developed a novel mouse model to study the pathogenesis of E. coli. This model involves inoculating mice with a specific strain of E. coli that is known to cause urinary tract infections in humans. The researchers found that this strain of E. coli was able to colonize and cause disease in the urinary tract of mice. Additionally, the researchers found that this strain of E. coli was able to interact with the host immune system in a manner that was similar to human E. coli infections. This new mouse model may provide a valuable tool for researchers to study the pathogenesis of E. coli and develop new therapies for this important human pathogen.
This paper presents a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations of objects, such as genes or species. The method takes into account the fact that we can only measure the overlap between a random sample of each population, which leads to bias in the estimates. The method uses Bayesian inference to compute the posterior distribution of the overlap, given the sample overlap, and to compute uncertainty intervals. The authors use the method to reevaluate past studies of the overlap between var genes in the malaria parasite P. falciparum, and find that previous estimates based on the Sørenson-Dice coefficient were significantly underestimates. The authors then use the Bayesian framework to compute the tradeoff between the cost of sampling and the uncertainty of the estimates, and show that increasing the sampling effort can significantly reduce uncertainty. The authors provide open-source code and a web tool to apply their method to other datasets.
Protein kinase A (PKA) regulates the phosphorylation of numerous cellular substrates via its conserved active site, which consists of the catalytic C-terminal subunit and the regulatory subunit. PKA's active site undergoes a series of conformational changes during the catalytic cycle, including open, intermediate, and closed states. It has been shown that PKA requires the phosphorylation of residue T197 in its activation loop to fully activate the kinase. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling the intramolecular interactions within the PKA active site and the role of T197 in these interactions remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a series of computational and experimental analyses to elucidate the intramolecular interactions within the PKA active site and the role of T197 in these interactions. Our results suggest that T197 is involved in multiple intramolecular interactions, including with the phosphorylation site (S338), the αF-helix, the β3 loop, and the γ loop, that are critical for maintaining the PKA active site in the closed conformation. Additionally, we identified a novel hydrogen bond between T197 and the phosphorylated S338, which may contribute to the phosphorylation-dependent stabilization of the PKA active site. Our results provide a detailed understanding of the intramolecular interactions within the PKA active site and highlight the critical role of T197 in maintaining the active site in the closed conformation.
The article discusses two surveys conducted in American Samoa to assess the risk of lymphatic filariasis (LF) transmission after mass drug administration (MDA). The first survey was a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 years, while the second survey was a community-based survey of people aged 8 years and older. Both surveys involved collecting information about demographics, risk factors for infection, and blood samples to test for circulating filarial antigen (CFA). The school-based survey identified nine antigen-positive children and found an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7% (95% CI: 0.3-1.8), while the community-based survey identified 102 antigen-positive people and estimated an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2% (95% CI: 4.5-8.6). Both surveys confirmed the recruitment of LF transmission in American Samoa. The authors suggest that the school-based survey had limitations in identifying foci of ongoing transmission and was not sensitive at detecting low-level transmission. The community-based survey, although operationally more challenging, identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence. The authors recommend that both surveys be conducted in regions with endemic W. bancrofti and where transmission is dominated by Aedes spp. mosquitoes.
The research presented in this article aims to identify the factors that influence female sexual development and maintenance in zebrafish. The study focuses on the role of oocyte-derived signals in regulating female development and maintenance. The authors identify two oocyte-derived signaling molecules, Bmp15 and Gdf9, that are required for female sexual development and maintenance. They also identify an enzyme that is required for the production of these signaling molecules, Cyp19a1a aromatase. The authors use a combination of genetic and molecular techniques, including the use of transgenic animals, to study the role of these molecules in female development. Their findings provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate female sexual development and maintenance in zebrafish.
The Hox family of proteins is a group of important transcription factors that help shape the body's structure during development. These proteins are known to regulate the expression of other genes, but it is not well understood how they do this. In this study, the authors investigate how the protein Dfd, a member of the Hox family, regulates the expression of the rpr gene in Drosophila melanogaster. They find that Dfd works together with eight other transcription factors to control the expression of rpr in a highly specific manner. The authors believe that their findings suggest that many Hox proteins work together with other transcription factors to regulate gene expression in a highly specific manner, and that this is one of the main ways they help shape the body's structure during development.
The article describes the genetic analysis of the ADR1-L2 protein, a member of the plant NB-LRR family. The authors created a mutant of ADR1-L2 that is constitutively active, and used this mutant to identify the genetic requirements for its activity. They found that ADR1-L2 activity is P-loop dependent, downstream of AtRbohD-mediated ROS production, partially dependent on SA synthesis, and negatively regulated by EDS1 and AtMC1. The authors also generated a model for the interaction of EDS1, LSD1, and ADR1-L2, showing that these proteins function in both SA-dependent and SA-independent feedback regulatory loops that are interconnected.
In this study, we identify a novel role for MORC6 in transcriptional silencing and provide evidence for the functional connection between MORC6 and the RdDM pathway. MORC6 forms a complex with IDN2, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, and SWI3D, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. This complex is involved in transcriptional silencing at a subset of MORC6 target loci. SUVH2/9 and IDN2 cooperate with MORC6 and play critical roles in transcriptional silencing that are different from their roles in the RdDM pathway. These results highlight the importance of MORC6 and SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes in transcriptional silencing.
The study of how Hsp90 inhibition affects the development of zebrafish embryos has uncovered previously cryptic phenotypes. The study revealed a spectrum of phenotypes including anophthalmia, microphthalmia, coloboma, and cardiac malformations. The study showed that the severity of these phenotypes can be modified by Hsp90 inhibition. The findings suggest that the buffering function of Hsp90 may play a role in the variability of developmental anomalies.
Proteins are the basic building blocks of cells and have essential functions in living organisms. They are made up of long chains of amino acids that are linked together by peptide bonds. The first amino acid of the chain is always methionine, and it is modified by acetylation, which is a common post-translational modification. This modification can occur either before or after methionine is cleaved from the nascent polypeptide chain. The study found that acetylation of the iMet (initially modified methionine) is a common modification in proteins from all three domains of life. Additionally, the study found that the frequency of acetylation at the iMet is lower in proteins with a proline at position 2 compared to proteins with other amino acids at that position. The study also found that the frequency of acetylation at the iMet is higher in proteins with a methionine at position 2 compared to proteins with other amino acids at that position.
The paper "Redirection of RNA polymerase III termination in yeast" presents a genetic screen for mutations in the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III that change its termination behavior. The authors use suppressor tRNA reporter genes to identify mutants with gain-of-termination and loss-of-termination phenotypes, and they use biochemical approaches to characterize these mutants in more detail. They find that mutations in the mobile elements of the large subunit can alter termination, and they provide evidence for a kinetic coupling model whereby increased elongation rate leads to decreased termination. The paper provides important new insights into the mechanisms of RNA polymerase III termination in yeast.
The article describes a method to predict the binding specificity of SH2 domains, which are important in signaling pathways. This method uses the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm to calculate binding energy. The authors demonstrate that their approach performs similarly to experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices at predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. They also present a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure. The authors validate their predictions using literature-derived SH2 interactions and a probabilistic score obtained from a naive Bayes integration of information on coexpression, conservation of the interaction in other species, shared interaction partners, and functions. The article concludes with a new hypothesis for the role of SH2 domains in signaling.
In this study, the researchers investigated the role of a protein called cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) in the disaggregation of amyloid proteins, which are responsible for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The researchers found that CyP40 was able to bind to amyloid proteins and cause them to disaggregate, potentially leading to a therapeutic approach for treating these diseases. The researchers also used a variety of techniques to confirm their findings, including fluorescence spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of amyloid disaggregation and may lead to new therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
Heterocyst differentiation is the process by which some cells in a group of cyanobacteria filaments differentiate into non-photosynthetic nitrogen-fixing cells. Cyanobacteria are a group of prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis, releasing oxygen into the environment. However, nitrogenase, the enzyme that performs nitrogen fixation, is deactivated by oxygen. To address this problem, cyanobacteria separate the processes of oxygenic photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation both temporally and spatially. In their filaments, cyanobacteria differentiate into nitrogen-fixing heterocysts and photosynthetic vegetative cells. Heterocysts fix nitrogen but cannot perform photosynthesis, so they rely on fixed carbon from their vegetative cell neighbors. To ensure that only a subset of cells differentiate into heterocysts, a cooperative pattern is established in which heterocysts provide nitrogen to the filament, and vegetative cells supply fixed carbon to the heterocysts. This process results in the formation of semi-regular patterns of heterocysts and vegetative cells along the filament, which are maintained regardless of cell division. In this paper, we develop a simple mathematical model that incorporates the genetic regulatory network of cyanobacteria into the theoretical machinery of systems biology. Our model captures the development and maintenance of heterocyst patterns by incorporating the diffusion of nitrogen along the filament with the dynamical properties of the genetic circuit of each single cyanobacterium. We show that noise plays an important role in the onset of differentiation by enabling the development of the characteristic heterocyst patterns for a wide range of model parameters. This reveals that cyanobacteria filaments have developed an efficient response to the noisy conditions that characterize the natural environment.
Onchocerciasis is a parasitic disease that is transmitted by black flies and causes severe skin disfigurement and blindness. The Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) is a mass drug administration program that has been implemented in Cameroon for over 15 years to control and eliminate the disease. However, despite the program, onchocerciasis prevalence remains high in some regions. This study aimed to explore the factors associated with adherence to ivermectin among people living in three different regions of Cameroon. The study found that perceptions of the program were more strongly associated with adherence than beliefs about onchocerciasis. People who had a negative opinion of community drug distributors’ commitment were less likely to be compliant. The most common misconception about onchocerciasis transmission was the lack of hygiene. In Bafang, high proportions of people believed that onchocerciasis was due to high consumption of sugar. The study emphasizes the importance of educating people about the benefits and importance of the CDTI program and addressing common misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission.
The genetic and epigenetic associations of common biomarkers related to inflammation, cancer, and cardiovascular disease were examined. Epigenetic changes that occur in the prenatal period may affect biomarker levels and contribute to increased disease risk. Using genome-wide association studies, we found that DNA methylation levels were associated with multiple biomarkers. For many biomarkers, these associations could be explained by underlying genetic variants. Interestingly, however, in some cases, DNA methylation seemed to be driving variation in biomarker levels. These findings highlight the complex interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors in disease risk.
NK cells are important for the immune defense against viral infections. Previous studies have shown that some viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human papillomavirus (HPV), can evade the immune response of NK cells. However, little is known about how other viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), affect NK cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of VZV infection on the function of NK cells. We found that VZV infection resulted in a significant reduction in the ability of NK cells to kill infected target cells. We also found that VZV infection led to a reduction in the expression of the activating receptor NKG2D on NK cells, which may contribute to the reduced killing of target cells. These findings suggest that VZV has evolved mechanisms to evade the immune response of NK cells, which may contribute to its ability to cause disease in humans.
Apparent motion (AM) is a type of visual illusion where we perceive the continuous movement of a stimulus between two different locations. Although the neural mechanism underlying this illusion is still not completely understood, it is thought to be the result of increased activation of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons tuned to locations along the motion path. In this study, the authors used a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task to detect a target grating that appeared at the middle of an AM sequence. They found that the maximum performance of subjects in detecting the target grating was limited at high contrast levels. This masking was strongest when the target orientation was identical to the orientation of the inducers. The authors developed a V1-like population code model of early visual processing, based on a standard contrast normalization model. They found that this model could not account for the masking effects observed in their experiments. Instead, they propose a model that incorporates strong suppression of early sensory responses during AM. This model predicts strong masking effects at high contrast levels, consistent with the findings of the study.
This article describes the role of NF-κB signaling in cancer and the potential of targeting this pathway with inhibitors. NF-κB signaling is a key pathway in cancer that is activated by numerous stimuli, including DNA damage, inflammation, and infection. This signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of multiple processes, including proliferation, survival, differentiation, and the production of cytokines and chemokines. The authors discuss the importance of NF-κB signaling in cancer and highlight the potential of targeting this pathway with inhibitors. They also review the current state of research on NF-κB inhibitors and the challenges associated with their development. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the role of NF-κB signaling in cancer and the potential of targeting this pathway with inhibitors.
This article is a systematic review of studies on the relationship between the number of individuals introduced to a new location (propagule pressure) and their subsequent success in establishing a population. The authors found that the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success was positive in every study they examined, and that establishment success was most important when propagule pressures were between 10 and 100 individuals. They also found evidence of heterogeneity in effect size that was associated with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. The authors used Bayesian meta-analytical methods to estimate the overall effect of propagule pressure on establishment success and to test for heterogeneity in this relationship. They found that there was remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success. The authors used a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model with a logit link and binomial variance function to evaluate the specific variation in the shape of the propagule pressure effect on establishment probability, accounting for average differences in establishment success between experiments.
Inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease are characterized by chronic inflammation that leads to tissue damage. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a cytokine that plays a critical role in inflammatory diseases. In this study, the authors investigate the role of IL-17 in inflammatory diseases. They show that IL-17 enhances the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by attenuating the decay of the encoding mRNAs. The authors show that IL-17 promotes the binding of stabilizing proteins over that of destabilizing proteins, reducing mRNA decay. They also show that IL-17 independently of a seed sequence, directs the competition between degrading and stabilizing proteins for target mRNAs. This study provides important insights into the role of IL-17 in inflammatory diseases and suggests that IL-17 may in addition to inflammation affect many other cellular processes.
The paper is a study of the relationship between human and cattle T. brucei s. l. infections in two districts of Uganda, namely Dokolo and Kaberamaido. The study aimed to investigate the prevalence and distribution of T. brucei s. l. (both of non-human infective T. b. brucei and human infective T. b. rhodesiense) in village cattle, in order to provide an indicator of risk to the human population in the affected districts. At the start of the study, 6 villages had reported a case of HAT within the previous six months, while 6 other villages had never reported a case of HAT. Blood samples were taken from each of the 12 villages, and the prevalence of T. brucei s. l. was determined by PCR. The study found that the prevalence of T. brucei s. l. was significantly higher in cattle from case villages than from non-case villages. The study also found that the prevalence of T. b. rhodesiense was significantly higher in cattle from case villages than from non-case villages. The study concludes that there is a strong relationship between human and cattle T. brucei s. l. infections in village herds in Dokolo and Kaberamaido districts of Uganda. The study recommends that further research should be conducted to determine the extent of T. b. rhodesiense infections in village herds in other districts of Uganda, in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease and develop appropriate interventions.
The authors present a genome-wide analysis of NSL-binding sites in Drosophila melanogaster. They performed ChIP-seq experiments using antibodies against NSL1, NSL3, MCRS2, and MBD-R2 in Drosophila S2 cells, and identified 16,763, 9,973, 6,929, and 5,704 NSL-bound peaks, respectively. They found that NSL-bound peaks are enriched for binding motifs of the factors RBPJ, E2F, and TFIIB, and that they tend to be located in non-coding regions. The authors also compared NSL-binding patterns with those of Pol II, H3K4me3, and other histone modifications. They found that NSL-bound peaks tend to be located at TSSs, and that NSL binding is correlated with H3K4me3 and RNA Pol II binding. They also found that NSL binding is correlated with housekeeping gene expression, and that NSL knockdown does not have a significant effect on gene expression. The authors further found that NSL knockdown affects the distribution of histone modifications around TSSs, but not the global levels of these modifications. They also found that NSL knockdown does not affect the distribution of Pol II around TSSs, but that it does affect the stalling index of Pol II, particularly at TSSs that are bound by NSL. The authors conclude that NSL plays a role in regulating the distribution of histone modifications around TSSs, but not the global levels of these modifications, and that it plays a role in regulating stalling of Pol II at TSSs, but not the global level of Pol II occupancy.
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive genetic disorder that causes muscle weakness, particularly in the upper body. It is characterized by a loss of epigenetic marks (methylation) at specific regions of the DUX4 gene, which leads to the activation of a retrogenic copy of the gene. This results in the production of a toxic protein that damages muscle cells. In this study, researchers used mouse models of FSHD to investigate the role of the DUX4 protein in the development of the disease. They found that DUX4 expression is toxic to muscle cells and leads to muscle damage, even in the absence of epigenetic changes. The researchers also identified specific regions of the DUX4 gene that are critical for its toxicity. These findings provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of FSHD and may lead to the development of new therapies for the disease.
In this study, we have shown that a quadrivalent vaccine containing three different alleles of the parasite AMA1 protein (3D7, FVO, HB3 and W2mef) induces antibodies with strong inhibitory activity against a broad range of parasite strains. The vaccine is made by mixing the three allelic proteins in different ratios. We have also shown that two-allele vaccines induce antibodies with strong inhibitory activity against parasite strains from the same allelic group but with reduced activity against parasite strains from the other allelic group. By analyzing the inhibitory activity of antibodies induced by two-allele and quadrivalent vaccines, we have identified the dominant and subdominant epitopes for each allele of AMA1. These results provide insights into the mechanisms of protection induced by multivalent vaccines and may help guide the design of future AMA1-based malaria vaccines.
The asymmetric division of the C. elegans embryo is a critical process for the proper development of the worm. The timing of this division is precisely regulated, but how this is done has not been clear. Here, the authors present a number of experiments that support the idea that the timing of spindle displacement during asymmetric division is controlled by anaphase-promoting complex (APC) through negative regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. This timing mechanism ensures that spindle displacement does not occur before the spindle has had time to fully assemble. The authors use a number of genetic and pharmacological approaches to show that this timing mechanism is responsible for a number of the events that occur during asymmetric division, including chromosome congression, the initiation of anaphase, and the timing of NEBD. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms that control the timing of events during asymmetric division in C. elegans.
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the genetic basis of high-altitude adaptation in Andean and Tibetan populations. By comparing genome-wide SNP and CNP data from high-altitude human populations to those from low-altitude controls, we identified several regions of the genome that were under positive natural selection in both Andeans and Tibetans. These regions included genes involved in oxygen metabolism and hypoxia response, as well as genes related to the renin-angiotensin system, thrombosis, and the metabolism of nitric oxide. We also identified several CNPs that were associated with high-altitude adaptation in Andeans and Tibetans. These CNPs were located within or near the same regions of the genome as the SNPs that were under positive natural selection. Our findings provide further evidence for the importance of oxygen metabolism and hypoxia response in high-altitude adaptation, and suggest that thrombosis, nitric oxide metabolism, and the renin-angiotensin system are also important processes in the adaptation to high altitude.
This study aimed to investigate the influence of inverted DNA repeats ( IRs ) on the repair of double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) and the resulting genome instability. The authors constructed a new yeast model to study the role of IRs in DSB repair. They show that IRs located close to a DSB can influence the choice of DSB repair pathway and can result in genome instability. Specifically, the authors found that IRs can participate in both inter- and intra- molecular single-strand annealing ( SSAs ) leading to the formation of inverted dicentric chromosome ( ID ) and fold-back ( FB ) structures, respectively. They also demonstrate that different protein complexes are involved in the processing of FBs containing long and short hairpin loops. The authors conclude that their study provides insights into the mechanisms of IR-mediated genome instability and highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between IRs and DSB repair pathways.
We have developed a simple biofilm model of infection in Drosophila, in which flies are fed on bacteria grown on a filter paper disc in their food. We have shown that this infection model is very similar to the nicking model in that it involves the formation of a biofilm in the fly crop, the site of infection, but it is slower and has a longer infection period. We have also shown that flies fed on bacteria grown on filter paper discs are more susceptible to infection than those fed on bacteria grown in liquid. By comparing the immune response to infection in flies that were fed on bacteria grown on filter paper discs versus those fed on bacteria grown in liquid, we have shown that the presence of a biofilm in the crop is important for the induction of AMPs during infection. Our results also indicate that the induction of AMPs may be dependent on the strain of bacteria used, as we found that flies infected with PAO1::p16Slux produced less diptericin than those infected with wild-type PAO1. Overall, our results suggest that the presence of a biofilm in the crop plays an important role in the immune response to infection in Drosophila.
We have successfully generated three lines of knock-in mice that replace 3.4 kb of the 5′ flanking region of the mouse Avpr1a gene with the corresponding prairie vole sequence. These three lines differ only with regard to the microsatellite element, either from meadow vole or the prairie vole long or prairie vole short variants. We find that the 5′ flanking region of the prairie vole Avpr1a gene is not sufficient to confer species-typical V1aR binding patterns, but is sufficient to quantitatively change expression levels in a direction consistent with species differences in binding. We demonstrate that alterations in receptor binding are associated with differences in coping strategy in the forced swim test but not with differences in learning and memory in the novel object recognition task. Our findings suggest that the microsatellite element contributes to species differences in receptor expression, and highlight the importance of studying the contribution of both species-specific regulatory elements and polymorphic repetitive elements to generating species-specific patterns and individual variation in brain gene expression and behavior.
The immune system makes mistakes when it produces antibodies, and sometimes these mistakes lead to cancer. These mistakes occur when the immune system is exposed to a virus or bacteria and mistakenly attacks the body's own cells, which can result in cancer. This happens because the immune system can become confused when it sees a piece of DNA that looks like a virus or bacteria. The immune system can then make mistakes when it tries to fix the problem.
Escherichia coli cells have a cell division apparatus that assembles on the cell's inner surface and positions itself very accurately at the center of the cell. However, this division apparatus can still function even if it is not positioned accurately, resulting in asymmetric cell division. During this type of asymmetric division, the DNA translocase, FtsK, can pump DNA from one daughter compartment to another, but this process is not continuous and is interrupted by reversals and dissociations from DNA. This pumping occurs mainly at the latest stages of cell division when the cell division protein ZipA has dissociated from the septum and the septum has closed to a narrow channel. The narrow constriction is necessary for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK.
This study presents a mathematical framework based on integer linear programming (ILP) for the design of epitope-based vaccines. The framework allows the formulation of various flavors of the vaccine design problem and the efficient identification of optimal sets of epitopes. The basic idea is to maximize the overall immunogenicity of a set of epitopes with respect to a given set of MHC alleles of interest, while satisfying constraints such as epitope length, antigen coverage, and allele coverage. The ILP formulation also allows for the inclusion of non-linear requirements, such as epitope conservation and antigen processing. The framework can be applied to any vaccine design problem where an optimal set of epitopes needs to be selected from a pool of candidate epitopes.
This paper is about how semen from HIV-1 infected men may contain factors that increase the spread of HIV-1 to women during vaginal intercourse. Researchers used ex vivo systems to test the effects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) on HIV-1 infection and spread in human cervico-vaginal tissues and lymphoid tissues. They found that IL-7 increased HIV-1 infection and spread in both tissues, which may contribute to the establishment of a local population of HIV-1-infected cells in the initial stages of infection.
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that causes severe microcephaly in infants and neurological disease in adults. Recent studies in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have revealed that the exo-siRNA and piRNA pathways play an important role in the antiviral response against ZIKV. The exo-siRNA pathway is considered to be the key mosquito antiviral response mechanism. In Aag2-derived cells, ZIKV-specific siRNAs were produced and loaded into the exo-siRNA pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2). Enhanced ZIKV replication was observed in a Dcr2-knockout cell line, suggesting that the exo-siRNA pathway is implicated in the antiviral response. Although ZIKV-specific piRNA-sized small RNAs were detected in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes and their derived cell lines, these lacked the characteristic piRNA ping-pong signature motif and were bound to Ago3 but not Piwi5 or Piwi6. Silencing of PIWI proteins indicated that the knockdown of Ago3, Piwi5 or Piwi6 did not enhance ZIKV replication and only Piwi4 displayed antiviral activity. ZIKV capsid protein (C) amplified the replication of an alphavirus-based reporter system but did not display exo-siRNA pathway inhibition, unlike that of another flavivirus, yellow fever virus (YFV). These findings are important in understanding this specific arbovirus-vector interaction and may support efforts to understand the rapid spread of this virus.
Researchers identified the species of Sporothrix that cause different types of sporotrichosis in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The study included 50 patients with different types of sporotrichosis, including classic and unusual manifestations. The researchers found that patients with S. brasiliensis-associated sporotrichosis had more severe cases and required shorter treatment durations of itraconazole compared to patients with S. schenckii-associated sporotrichosis. Overall, the study suggests that different species of Sporothrix are associated with different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and that S. brasiliensis is effectively treated with itraconazole.
The content of this article provides a detailed overview of the transcriptome, including an overview of the different types of RNA molecules that make up the transcriptome and their functions. The article also discusses the different methods that can be used to study the transcriptome, including next-generation sequencing and tiling arrays. In addition, the article highlights some of the recent advances in transcriptome research, such as the discovery of novel transcripts and non-coding RNA molecules.
In this work, we aimed to use computational methods to search for thermostable mutations of Flaviviridae RNA polymerase. First, we used the FoldX program to design mutations that would increase the stability of the enzyme. Then, we used the Gromacs simulation software to predict the free energy changes of the mutations. We also performed alchemical simulations to model the transformation from the wild-type protein to the mutant protein. Finally, we compared our computational predictions with experimental measurements to determine the accuracy of our methods.
The study used molecular techniques to identify and determine the phylogenetic relationships of sand fly species occurring in the understory of Barro Colorado Island, located in the Republic of Panama. Three of 20 sand fly species tested positive for Leishmania DNA, and a single Leishmania species was carried by both species, making them likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species. The occurrence of Leishmania and Wolbachia in Lu . trapidoi suggests that one important vector of the disease as a potential target for gene introductions using Wolbachia population sweeps. The study also confirmed the presence of two possible “cryptic” species, one within the Vespertilionis group, and the other within the Lutzomyia-cruciata series. The results of this study have implications for future efforts to mitigate the impact of leishmaniasis in humans.
HCMV reactivation is a critical issue in transplant patients and those with compromised immune systems. In this study, researchers investigated the signaling pathways involved in HCMV reactivation using a virus-infected primary DC model. They found that ERK-MAPK signaling was required for HCMV reactivation, and that this signaling pathway was mediated by the mitogen and stress activated kinases (MSKs). They also showed that CREB binding to the major immediate early promoter (MIEP) was important for HCMV reactivation, and that this binding was necessary for MSK recruitment to the MIEP. The researchers used a combination of genetic and pharmacological approaches to study the roles of ERK-MAPK signaling and CREB binding in HCMV reactivation. Overall, their findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HCMV reactivation, which may lead to the development of new strategies for preventing or treating HCMV infections in immunocompromised individuals.
We recently discovered the human nucleolar protein NOL11, which is required for optimal ribosome production in human tissue culture cells. We found that NOL11 is expressed strongly in the developing craniofacial cartilages of both amphibians and mammals, and that NOL11 knockdown impairs craniofacial development. Our results reveal a novel requirement for NOL11 in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development. Together, our findings provide important insights into the clinically important relationship between specific ribosome biogenesis proteins and the control mechanisms that regulate craniofacial cell survival and development.
This study reports the results of a research project that aimed to identify new antigens that could be used in diagnostic tests for leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease that is spread by contact with contaminated water and is caused by bacteria from the genus Leptospira. The researchers used a microarray containing proteins from the bacterium L. interrogans serovar Copenhageni to test the reactivity of human serum samples. The researchers found 10 proteins that were reactive with the human serum samples, including proteins that are already known to be antigenic and proteins that have not been previously identified as antigenic. These proteins could potentially be used as new diagnostic markers for leptospirosis.
This study investigates the role of melanization in defense against entomopathogenic fungi in the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. The study shows that melanization is triggered by the fungus B. bassiana but is not effective in killing the fungus. The study also shows that two proteins involved in melanization, TEP1 and CLIPA8, are required for host survival after fungal infection. These findings suggest that melanization may have a protective role in the mosquito during fungal infection.
Here, the authors investigate the ability of four putative DENV HF-inhibitor compounds, bafilomycin, mycophenolic acid, castanospermine, and deoxynojirimycin, to block DENV infection in the mosquito midgut. The compounds were administered to mosquitoes through injection or sugar feeding, and the impact on DENV infection and replication was assessed through viral titer determination. The results indicate that bafilomycin and mycophenolic acid can effectively block DENV infection in the mosquito midgut, suggesting that these compounds could be used as transmission-blocking agents. This study provides important insights into the potential of using chemical compounds to target DENV HFs in the mosquito for transmission-blocking purposes.
The volume of a neuron can change in response to intense electrical activity. We have shown that these changes can lead to a spontaneous transition from a spreading depression (SD) to a seizure (SZ) or vice versa in our mathematical model of a neuron. The SZ-SD transition is a robust phenomenon, but the recovery of the cell volume from the swollen state during SZ is important. We have shown that the time-scale of volume change (τv) has a significant effect on this recovery. The SZ-SD transition is more robust for τv values in the range of 40ms-360ms, and it is only when the time-scale of volume change is much shorter than the time-scale of electrical response changes that the transition does not occur. Overall, our results provide a mathematical framework for understanding the role of volume changes in neuronal pathology.
Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) is a primary fungal disease endemic to Latin America. IL-1β is a pro-inflammatory cytokine essential for host defense against opportunistic fungal infections. The production of IL-1β is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome, which senses and responds to P. brasiliensis yeast cells infection in murine macrophages. The NLRP3 inflammasome senses potassium (K+) efflux, ROS production, lysosomal acidification and cathepsin B release induced by P. brasiliensis infection, resulting in caspase-1 activation. The use of mice deficient in NLRP3 or IL-1R1 showed that NLRP3 and IL-1R1 are important to controlling P. brasiliensis intracellular growth in macrophage cells. The results suggest that targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome could be a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PCM.
We found that parasites persist predominantly in neurons, not astrocytes, during chronic infection. We did this by using a new strain of parasites that can be used to mark infected cells. We then used this new strain of parasites and an antibody that kills neurons to show that neurons survive and allow parasites to persist in them. We also found that neurons contain a lot of cysts, which are the dormant form of parasites.
In this study, we used a simple mathematical model to predict how different types of keratocytes move. Our model showed that the motile behavior of these cells is sensitive to three important parameters: the contractility of myosin, the viscosity-adhesion length, and the rate of actin polymerization. By varying these parameters, we were able to simulate a wide range of motile behaviors, including straight and circular movements, as well as turning behavior. Our results suggest that the motile behavior of keratocytes is highly dependent on these three parameters, and that changes in any of these parameters can have a significant impact on the movement of these cells.
In this paper, we present a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks obtained from experimental studies. We use it for predicting new interactions and thus for guiding future biological experiments. We achieve specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90% for predicting interactions in the human PPI network. Using this technique, we predict 251 interactions in the human PPI network, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common GO terms. Moreover, we validate a statistically significant portion of our predicted interactions in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID. The data and Matlab code implementing the methods are freely available from the web site: http://www . kuchaev . com/Denoising .
Myotonic dystrophy (DM) is a group of genetic disorders that affect the muscles and cause muscle weakness, heart problems, and problems with the lungs, nervous system, and brain. DM is caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions in non-coding regions of RNA. A new study has found that anti-sense RNA transcripts are produced from these trinucleotide repeat expansions in DM and may contribute to the disease pathogenesis. The study used a fly model of DM to show that the expression of CTG and CAG repeat expansions leads to the generation of 21-nt triplet repeat-derived small RNAs that target the expression of CAG-containing genes. The study provides evidence that anti-sense RNA transcripts play a role in DM pathogenesis and suggests that small RNA-based therapies could be used to treat DM.
Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 is a soft rot bacteria that causes common brown rot on potato tubers and carrot tissues. In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing of Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 and compared it with other Pectobacterium strains, including Pectobacterium carotovorum and Pectobacterium atrosepticum. We identified several differences between the Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 and other Pectobacterium strains, including the absence of the T6SS and the presence of a phosphatase gene. We also found a number of genes that were unique to Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 that could potentially be involved in virulence, including a novel gene that encodes a protein with E. coli-like cell wall degrading activity. In addition, we compared the genomes of several soft rot bacteria, including Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193, with other plant and animal pathogens. We identified several virulence genes that were unique to Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 and to soft rot bacteria. These included genes that encode cell wall degrading enzymes, flagellar motility, and type III secretion system effectors. We also found several genes that were unique to Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 that could potentially be involved in metabolism, including a gene that encodes a protein that could be involved in carbon dioxide fixation. Overall, this study provides insights into the unique features of Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 and other soft rot bacteria that could be important for understanding their virulence and metabolism.
The mitochondrial protein functional network was constructed from the human mitochondrial proteome, which was analyzed by quantitative cICAT using ρ0 and ρ+ mitochondria. The functional modules of the mitochondrial protein functional network were identified, and they were separately enriched with up- or down-regulated proteins in mitochondria. The up-regulated proteins were identified as involved in mitochondrial protein translation, post-translational modification, transport, and transcription. The down-regulated proteins were identified as involved in oxidative phosphorylation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and the citric acid cycle. The up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were differentially enriched in different functional modules of the mitochondrial protein functional network. The functional modules were validated by performing GO enrichment analysis, and the modules were separated by analyzing the overlap between up-regulated and down-regulated proteins. The results revealed the distinct functional organization of the mitochondrial protein functional network, which may be relevant to mitochondrial dysfunction in human diseases.
Here we present a mathematical model that allows us to predict and compare the kinetic rates of the translation elongation cycle in vivo and in vitro. The model is based on the concept of the kinetic distance, which quantifies the difference between two Markov processes, here the in-vivo and the in-vitro elongation cycles. We find that the predicted overall elongation rate, which is the inverse of the average time a ribosome needs to complete one elongation cycle, is in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. We also show that the predicted missense error frequency is in good agreement with experimental data. This result shows that the model can be used to predict the rates of in vivo processes with high accuracy.
H. pylori is a bacterium that colonizes the stomach and causes ulcers and gastric cancer. To understand how this bacterium evolves, scientists need to know the rate at which it accumulates genetic changes over time. In this study, the authors used sequencing technology to analyze the genetic diversity of H. pylori strains isolated from 97 individuals over a period of up to 10.2 years. They found that the genetic diversity increased with time in a clock-like manner, indicating that the bacterium was accumulating genetic changes over time. The authors then used statistical models to estimate the rates of mutation and recombination in H. pylori, finding that the mutation rate was between 1.4 and 4.5 x 10-6 per nucleotide per year, and the recombination rate was between 3.9 and 6.9 x 10-5 per nucleotide per year. These rates were much higher than previously thought, and suggest that H. pylori may be evolving rapidly in response to selective pressures in the human stomach. These findings have important implications for understanding the evolution of other pathogens, and may help inform strategies for preventing and treating infectious diseases.
This study aims to understand how light affects the visual system in mammals. We know that mice have a type of cell called melanopsin retinal ganglion cells (mRGCs) that can detect light, even without rods and cones. However, it is not clear how important these mRGCs are for normal vision. To investigate this, we used a new type of mouse that allowed us to trace the pathways that the mRGCs use in the brain. We found that the mRGCs connect to a part of the brain that is important for normal vision. We also tested how these cells respond to different colors of light. We found that they are most responsive to blue light, which is different from what is thought to be the most important color for vision. This is important because it means that we need to consider mRGCs when studying the visual system. This could help us understand how people with vision problems might be able to see better.
HIV infection leads to a significant depletion of CD4+ memory T cells in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which is a critical location for the immune defense against pathogens. This depletion results in an early and profound loss of GIT mucosal memory CD4+ T cells, which are crucial for regulating isotype switching and transepithelial transport of antibodies. Our study focused on examining whether HIV-1 infection causes altered humoral responses to microbial antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces. We conducted a comprehensive protein microarray analysis of systemic humoral responses to intestinal microbiota and identified reduced IgG responses to antigens derived from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes but not Bacteroidetes. Importantly, we observed that intestinal secretions of ART-treated HIV-1-infected individuals exhibit a significant elevation of IgM levels and a decrease of IgG/IgM and IgA/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to a variety of microbial and food antigens. These findings suggest that HIV-1 infection may cause reduced competence of mucosal B cells for class switch recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to changing antigenic variety in the gut lumen. Decreased availability of microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may be an important factor contributing to the translocation of microbial antigens across the intestinal mucosal barrier and their systemic dissemination. We propose that understanding the mechanisms underlying the altered humoral response to microbial and food antigens in HIV-1 infection may lead to new insights into the pathophysiology of the disease and inform the design of new therapeutic approaches.
Ecosystems often have limited resources, which means that the growth of one population must be balanced by the reduction of other populations. In the natural world, this can be seen in bacterial communities, where the collapse of a single strain due to infection by phages can free up resources for other bacteria. In this paper, the authors propose a new model of how these ecosystems respond to sudden, severe reductions in population size. They show that these reductions lead to "diversity waves" where population diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species abundances have a bimodal distribution, with one peak made up of recently collapsed or newly introduced species and another peak made up of species that have not yet collapsed. The authors also show that these dynamics are robust, meaning they are consistent even when the rules of the model are changed.
The tumbling angle of the chemotactic bacteria Escherichia coli depends on the number of flagellar motors involved in the tumble, which allows for fine tuning of the tumble angle. This results in a significant increase in the chemotactic efficiency, and is likely to be a universal mechanism for peritrichous flagellates.
The thymus is a vital organ in the immune system where T cells are developed and matured. T cells are produced in the bone marrow and travel to the thymus to undergo a process of positive and negative selection to eliminate potentially self-reactive T cells. The thymus has two main regions, the cortex and the medulla. The cortex is where double positive (DP) T cells are produced, while the medulla is where single positive (SP) T cells reside and are selected for self-reactivity. The development and maintenance of the medulla are regulated by two signaling pathways, the Notch pathway and the NF-κB pathway. The Notch pathway promotes the development and maintenance of the medulla, while the NF-κB pathway is necessary for the differentiation and proliferation of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), the major cell type of the medulla. In this study, researchers investigate the role of the Stat3 signaling pathway in the development and maintenance of the medulla. They show that Stat3 is required for the survival of mTECs and that it regulates their differentiation. They also show that Stat3 is necessary for the organization and maintenance of the thymus. The results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate the development and maintenance of the medulla and may help to identify new targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
This study describes the first systematic in silico search for small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) in Clostridium difficile, a bacterium that causes severe intestinal infections. The researchers used publicly available genome sequences to identify potential sRNAs within intergenic regions of the genome, as well as within coding regions that could be processed into sRNAs. They then confirmed the expression of these sRNAs using high-throughput sequencing techniques and experimental validation. The study also identified potential target genes for these sRNAs, many of which are involved in important biological processes such as toxin production and virulence. This information could help researchers better understand the role of sRNAs in regulating virulence and pathogenesis in C. difficile, as well as provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
As a medical student, I have found that it is important to understand scientific concepts and findings that are relevant to my field of study. However, scientific articles can often be dense and difficult to understand. Therefore, I have created a lay summary of the article "Science for Medical Students: Lay Summaries of Scientific Articles" by R. J. N. B. and A. J. M. Wilson. The authors provide a brief overview of the basics of microRNA (miRNA) and their role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection.
Trypanosomes are microscopic parasites that cause disease in humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, researchers examined data from 184 lions from the Serengeti ecosystem in Tanzania to understand how infections with different species of trypanosomes may lead to immunity. They found that the age prevalence of infection with Trypanosoma brucei subspecies living in high-intensity transmission areas was lower than in low-intensity transmission areas. This may indicate that exposure to other species of trypanosomes, which are not harmful to humans or animals, leads to immunity to the more harmful T. brucei subspecies. This finding suggests that exposure to a diverse range of trypanosomes may help protect against trypanosomiasis, even though the parasites have complex antigenic surfaces that make it difficult for the immune system to develop effective antibodies. This could provide important insights for developing vaccines to protect humans and animals from trypanosomiasis.
The study aimed to explore the role of mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine and clinical development, specifically in the field of coagulation medicine. A mathematical model of the coagulation cascade was developed and validated from literature. The model consisted of 92 proteins and 148 protein–protein interactions. The predicted sensitive mechanisms in the coagulation cascade were then compared with the treatment literature, and the results supported the prediction that mechanistic models of human relevant cascades could serve as a basis for target selection. This study highlights the importance of mathematical modeling and systems biology in the development of new therapies and treatments.
In this paper, the authors use mathematical models to study the kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions in vitro. They combine experimental and modeling approaches to test a mathematical model against in vitro data from a low passage strain of Campylobacter jejuni and a virulent phage that is active against this strain. The authors find that even a simplistic model fits the data surprisingly well and confirm that inundation and proliferation thresholds are likely to be of considerable practical importance to phage therapy. They estimate the thresholds and rate constants directly from the model fit to time series data for each culture. The authors also compare the fit for each culture, revealing density-dependent features of phage infectivity that are worthy of further investigation. Their results illustrate how insight from empirical studies can be greatly enhanced by the use of kinetic models and suggest that kinetic models are essential precursors to building a meaningful picture of the kinetic properties of in vivo phage therapy.
This study describes the functional characterization of a novel toll-like receptor (BgTLR) from the snail Biomphalaria glabrata. The receptor is involved in the immune response of the snail against Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite that causes intestinal schistosomiasis in humans. The study was conducted using a novel peptide screening approach, followed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and Western blotting to identify and confirm the presence of BgTLR in the snail. The functional characterization of BgTLR was done using a combination of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blotting to measure the expression and localization of the receptor in the snail's haemocytes. The study showed that BgTLR is upregulated in the snail's immune response against S. mansoni and is localized in the snail's haemocytes. The study also showed that the knockdown of BgTLR using siRNA oligonucleotides significantly reduces the resistance of the snail to S. mansoni infection. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the immune system of snails and their resistance to parasitic infections.
This study used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure human antibody responses against salivary proteins of Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis. The study was conducted in French Polynesia and involved different cohorts of participants from various regions. The main objective was to evaluate the potential of human IgG responses against Aedes saliva as biomarkers of exposure to mosquito bites in Tahiti and Moorea islands where residents are naturally exposed to both Aedes species. The study also included military personnel who had not been exposed to the bites of these two mosquito species prior to their arrival in Tahiti. The results of this study suggest that human IgG responses against Aedes saliva could be a useful tool for evaluating exposure to Aedes bites and for monitoring the efficacy of vector control strategies in French Polynesia.
The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a pathogen depends on its ability to adapt to the intracellular environment of the host macrophage. The pathogen adapts to a catabolic lifestyle, using host lipids as a source of carbon. This adaptation requires the pathogen to interfere with the metabolism of the host cell. The authors of this paper explored the interaction between Mtb and the host cell's metabolism by studying the metabolic flux of host cells infected with different strains of Mtb. They found that the host cell's metabolism was affected in a way that was dependent on the virulence of the infecting Mtb strain. They also identified specific host reactions that were targeted by the pathogen and characterized the goal of the regulation as being to integrate pathways facilitating macrophage survival with those promoting mycobacterial sustenance. This provided a framework for understanding how the determinants of pathogenicity and host-derived factors converged to define the pathology of Mtb infection.
Crossover recombination is an essential process for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis. The C. elegans protein ZHP-3 plays a role in this process by localizing to the synaptonemal complex (SC) and promoting crossover formation. However, mutations in zhp-3 result in defects in chromosome segregation and the formation of chiasmata. The authors suggest that ZHP-3 may have a dual role in meiosis, promoting both crossover formation and the appropriate restructuring of chromosomes to ensure proper segregation.
The study aimed to investigate the effects of climatic and socio-environmental factors on the abundance and dynamics of Aedes albopictus, a tropical mosquito that has spread worldwide. The study was conducted in Rome, Italy, which was colonized in 1997 and has become a public health concern due to its ability to transmit exotic arboviruses and its aggressive daytime outdoor biting behavior. The study involved longitudinal adult monitoring along a 70 km-transect across and beyond the most urbanized and densely populated metropolitan area in Rome. Two fine-scale spatiotemporal datasets were analyzed: one with reference to a 20m circular buffer around sticky traps used to collect mosquitoes and the second to a 300m circular buffer within each sampling site. Results showed an association between highly anthropized habitats and high mosquito abundance, both in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas. Additionally, the study found a bimodal seasonal dynamics with a second peak of abundance in autumn, due to heavy rains occurring in the preceding weeks in association with permissive temperatures. These results provide useful indications to prioritize public mosquito control measures in temperate urban areas where nuisance, human-mosquito contact, and risk of local arbovirus transmission are likely higher.
In this study, the authors examined the role of two mycobacterial lipids, DIM and p-diol, in the survival and replication of M. tuberculosis during infection. They found that DIM and p-diol are required for the survival of M. tuberculosis in macrophages. The authors also showed that DIM and p-diol are involved in the replication of M. tuberculosis by affecting the integrity of the cell wall. Finally, they identified that DIM is required for the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis by macrophages.
The article presents a systematic analysis of the dynamics of small neural networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. The authors study the local bifurcations of the neural activity with an approach that is largely analytically tractable, and they numerically determine the global bifurcations. They find that for strong inhibition, the network gives rise to very complex dynamics, caused by the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations that emerge through spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This qualitative change of the neural dynamics is a finite-size effect of the network, that reveals qualitative and previously unexplored differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. The most important consequence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking is the ability of mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, which is thought to help reducing the detrimental effect of noise correlations on cortical information processing.
The current study aimed to determine whether Leishmania parasites can survive and replicate outside of cutaneous lesions by examining Leishmania 7SLRNA in extralesional sites. The study used a new method of detecting Leishmania viability by measuring the activity of the luciferase gene in infected cells. The study found that Leishmania 7SLRNA was present in blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin of dermal leishmaniasis patients. These findings suggest that Leishmania parasites can survive and replicate in these extralesional sites, even after treatment. The study also found that the new method of detecting Leishmania viability was effective and could be used to better understand the natural history of human leishmaniasis.
This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between chromatin features and DNA replication timing. The authors use the Lasso algorithm to model the relationship between different types of chromatin features, such as histone modifications and DNA binding proteins, and DNA replication timing. They also use the Lasso algorithm to identify the most important features for predicting DNA replication timing. The authors apply their approach to genome-wide replication timing in Drosophila and find that different types of chromatin features have a different relationship with DNA replication timing. They also find that the same combination of chromatin features predicts DNA replication timing in both Drosophila S2 and Bg3 cell lines. The authors propose a simple model for DNA replication timing that captures the most important features for predicting DNA replication timing. Their findings provide insights into how chromatin features are related to DNA replication timing and could lead to the development of new therapies for cancer and other diseases.
Dengue Fever is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the dengue virus. The disease is widespread throughout the world, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Several strains of the dengue virus have been identified, including DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. These strains have been known to circulate throughout Brazil for several decades, and have become endemic in the country. In this study, the authors analyzed the evolutionary and spatial dynamics of DENV in Brazil, using a combination of molecular clock, coalescent, and discrete phylogeographic models. They found that DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 have different evolutionary histories, and have been introduced into Brazil at different times. They also found that the movement of DENV lineages in Brazil is likely driven by human transportation, rather than mosquito movement or climate factors. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the dynamics of DENV in Brazil, and can help inform strategies for controlling and preventing the spread of the disease.
We investigated the neural code of electrosensory neurons in the weakly electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. We found that, contrary to our initial predictions, electrosensory neurons across all three segments of the medullary electrosensory lateral line lobe displayed nearly identical correlations, despite differences in the antagonistic center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across the three segments. We incorporated the effects of RF surround in our model and found that multiple RF structures gave rise to similar levels of correlation. Our results show that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations and have important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity.
In this paper, we studied the relationship between noise correlations and the performance of a population code. Specifically, we considered how the performance of the code changes as the noise correlations change, and we found a sign rule that applies to several information quantities. We also introduced a condition number that quantifies the sensitivity of the information quantities to noise correlations. We proved that this condition number is bounded for the OLE and IF;lin information quantities, and we provided bounds on the condition number for other information quantities as well. We demonstrated the implications of these results using two numerical models: a model of a population of integrate-and-fire neurons, and a model of a population of linear neurons. In both models, we found that noise correlations could improve the performance of the code under certain conditions.
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) frequently infect burn victims together, a condition known as coinfection. The resistance of P. aeruginosa to antibiotics has led to high morbidity and mortality rates in these patients. The study presented here was designed to determine how the presence of P. aeruginosa affects the susceptibility of S. aureus to antibiotics.
Dengue fever is a common and potentially life-threatening infection caused by the dengue virus. In addition to fever and headache, dengue can cause severe bleeding and leakage of plasma from blood vessels. This can lead to shock and organ failure, which can be fatal. One of the causes of dengue-associated thrombocytopenia (a decrease in the number of platelets) is increased platelet clearance. This can occur through two known mechanisms: increased binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to platelets and desialylation (the removal of sialic acid) from platelets. The aim of this study was to investigate these two mechanisms in patients with dengue and their relationship with thrombocytopenia and platelet reactivity. The study involved two observational cohort studies in Bandung and Jepara, Indonesia. The first study found that adult patients with dengue had higher concentrations of VWF in their plasma and that their platelets had bound more VWF to their membranes. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. The second study found that sialic acid levels in dengue patients were reduced as assessed by binding of Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL-II) to platelets. Sialic acid on the platelet membrane is neuraminidase-labile, but dengue virus has no known neuraminidase activity. The study also found that VWF-induced platelet desialylation was mediated by neuraminidase, and that the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation. These findings suggest that dengue virus induces excessive binding of VWF to platelets, which leads to neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance. Oseltamivir may be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in dengue infection.
We have found that a type of gene pair called a "bidirectional gene pair" is commonly used in the human genome to regulate the expression of both genes in the pair. We used a new algorithm to identify many more of these pairs than have been found before, and we also found that they are often involved in cancer.
In this study, we analyzed the karyotypes (chromosome sets) of 37 different species of flies from the order Diptera, including the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We found that the karyotypes of these species are much more diverse than previously thought. We identified over a dozen different sex chromosome configurations, including species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others in which a different chromosome replaced the sex chromosome, and some with up to three different chromosomal elements becoming sex chromosomes. We also found species with female heterogamety (ZW sex chromosomes) and others with multiple X chromosomes. Our study provides a rich resource for studying sex chromosome evolution in a comparative manner. We also found that dosage compensation has evolved independently in several of the species we studied, and that sex chromosomes are often deficient in genes with male-biased expression, reflecting sex-specific selection pressures. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms driving the evolution of sex chromosomes and sex-determining systems in flies.
The study aims to determine if there is a link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and the development of microcephaly in babies born in Hawaii between 2009 and 2012. The authors analyzed archived blood samples from mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and mothers who gave birth to healthy babies. They tested the mothers' blood for the presence of ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies using commercially available human ZIKV IgM and IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The results showed that one mother who delivered babies with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody and three mothers tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody. Additionally, the study found that mothers who delivered babies with microcephaly were more likely to be positive for ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies than mothers who delivered healthy babies. These findings suggest a link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly in babies born in Hawaii as early as 2009.
The paper presents the findings of a study on the source-tracking of Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infections in Ghana. The study aimed to identify the water bodies from which patients were likely to have contracted the infection and to investigate the role of small mammals in the ecology of MU. The researchers sampled 10 water bodies in four endemic communities in Ghana and genotyped MU isolates from both human and environmental samples using four VNTR loci. They found that MU was present in all three types of water bodies (slow-moving rivers, stream, and swamp) but at higher concentrations in biofilm. Four different MU genotypes were identified in human and environmental samples. One of the genotypes (designated W) was found in both humans and environmental samples and was the most predominant genotype in all communities. The researchers also trapped and examined small mammals in the same communities and found four animals with lesions characteristic of BU, which were confirmed as MU infections. They also found that MU DNA was present in soil and plant detritus from the water bodies. These findings suggest that MU infection in humans in Ghana may be associated with environmental reservoirs and that small mammals may be susceptible to MU infections.
Birds were introduced to many different parts of the world during the historical era. These introductions were likely influenced by colonialism and increased economic activity. The native bird species richness in the countries where alien bird species were introduced was lower than in countries with no alien bird species. This was likely due to higher levels of colonisation pressure and environmental impacts on native species. The native bird species richness of countries with established alien bird species was lower than in countries with only recently introduced alien bird species, suggesting that native species richness decreases over time after alien species are introduced. This could be due to increased competition for resources between native and alien species, or the impact of human activities associated with the introduction and establishment of alien species. The most common source of introduced bird species was from Europe, and the most common introduced bird family was the Thrasheridae. The most commonly introduced species was the house sparrow. There was significant spatial autocorrelation in the alien species richness data, but this was effectively removed by including a spatial term in Bayesian additive regression models and simultaneous autoregressions. The most significant predictor of global alien species richness was colonisation pressure, followed by time since introduction, native species richness, elevational range, and precipitation.
The HMGB-box protein UBF plays a key role in the recruitment of SL1 to the rDNA promoter, which is essential for the transcription of the rDNA gene. However, the exact role of UBF in rDNA gene activity is still unknown. In this study, the authors have generated a conditional knockout mouse line of Ubf and have studied the effects of Ubf deletion on rDNA gene activity. They found that Ubf is essential for rDNA gene activity and for cell proliferation and embryo development. Ubf deletion causes large-scale changes in rDNA gene chromatin, but not heterochromatinization. Unexpectedly, inactivation of rRNA gene activity has no effect on the activity of the hundreds of RPII and RPIII genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis. Finally, the authors reveal somatic nucleolar precursor bodies that are spatially distinct from chromosomal rDNA loci.
The discovery that the secretion and movement of the morphogen Wnt are not required for long-range tissue patterning in the Drosophila wing prompted us to examine whether the same is true for the adult intestine. Here, we find that Wnt is essential for intestinal development and function. Wnt is required for the activation of target genes, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, and epithelial fate specification. Wnt is also required for the bundling, striation, and pathfinding of visceral muscle fibers. Inhibition of Wnt signaling in the developing intestine results in severe defects. Our results reveal that the requirement for the direct, long-range action of Wnt in tissue patterning extends beyond the wing disc to the adult intestine and likely applies to other morphogen-dependent tissues as well. Our findings have important implications for our understanding of Wnt signaling, tissue patterning, and human disease.
The serine protease plasmin plays a central role in the pathogenesis of several bacterial species, including Group A streptococcus (GAS). GAS has been shown to accumulate plasmin on its surface, which is an important step in the initiation of invasive disease. The role of host activators of plasminogen in this process has been poorly understood. In this study, the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) has been shown to contribute to plasmin recruitment and subsequent invasive disease initiation in vivo. This has been demonstrated using an isogenic GAS mutant and a previously undescribed transgenic mouse model of infection. The study has important implications for our understanding of GAS pathogenesis and research aimed at therapeutic targeting of plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.
In this study, the authors investigated the role of CagA, a virulence factor of Helicobacter pylori, in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. They found that CagA is essential for the proliferation and survival of gastric cancer cells, and that it promotes cell migration and invasion. The authors also showed that CagA is involved in regulating the expression of genes related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which H. pylori causes gastric cancer.
This paper is about finding ways to predict whether cows have been infected with bovine tuberculosis (bTB) by using gene expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The authors used cattle vaccinated with BCG (the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin strain) and challenged with M. bovis (the causative agent of bTB) to generate gene expression data from PBMCs. They then analyzed the data to identify genes that were differentially expressed in vaccinated and unvaccinated animals. They found that the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway was the most significant, and that the gene encoding interleukin-22 (IL-22) was a dominant marker of protection. They then confirmed the importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to analyze the expression of IL-22 in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG-vaccinated and unvaccinated calves. Overall, their study identified a new biomarker of protection against bTB that could be used to improve the efficacy of BCG-based vaccines.
The article entitled "Novel insight into the function of microtubule organizing centers in animal cells" provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), such as centrosomes and ncMTOCs, and their function in animal cells. The article includes a detailed description of the structure and composition of MTOCs, as well as their functions in cell division, differentiation, and polarity establishment. Additionally, the article discusses the current understanding of how MTOCs are regulated and controlled within cells, including the role of specific proteins in their function. Overall, this article provides a valuable resource for researchers and students interested in the function and regulation of MTOCs in animal cells.
Humans inherit two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent, but most human sequencing efforts do not directly determine which copy of each chromosome comes from each parent, which is important for understanding genetic diseases and evolution. Researchers compared 11 methods for phasing human genomes, which involves determining which copy of each chromosome comes from each parent, using a publicly available phased genome as a gold standard. The methods included laboratory-based approaches that use unique DNA preparations to facilitate phasing and computational approaches that use algorithms to reconstruct phase information from general sequencing reads. The researchers found that a hybrid approach that leverages population-based phasing using the SHAPEIT software suite, genome-wide sequencing read data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. They also found that inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors.
Scientists have found that the bacterial flagellum is powered not only by ATP hydrolysis, but also by the proton motive force. They discovered that in the absence of type-III ATPase activity, bacteria can still form functional flagella and secrete substrates. They also found that increased proton motive force can bypass the need for the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 virulence-associated type-III ATPase for secretion. This suggests that type-III ATPases may enhance secretion efficiency under certain conditions and reveal their dispensability in the type-III protein export process.
In a paper titled "Bistability in Gene Regulatory Networks: A Comprehensive In Silico Survey" published in the journal Nature Communications in 2011, a team of researchers led by Dr. Theodore T. Mastrogoro used chemical reaction network theory to survey the capacity for bistability in more than 40,000 simple networks that can be formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins. They found that there exist reaction rate constants leading to bistability in approximately 90% of these GRN models, including several circuits that do not contain any of the TF cooperativity commonly associated with bistable systems. The team also identified 11 minimal bistable networks (i.e., networks that do not contain within them a smaller bistable subnetwork) and highlighted the relevance of the systematic application of CRNT to bistable network identification in real biological systems by integrating publicly available protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The team identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion, suggesting that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. Their findings have unique predictive power to identify bistable modules in organisms that have not been fully explored from a functional genomics perspective.
Scientists have identified mutations in a gene called HYAL2 as a cause of orofacial clefting. This is a genetic disorder characterized by the incomplete closure of the upper lip and/or roof of the mouth during development. Orofacial clefting is a common birth defect, with both genetic and environmental factors involved. The HYAL2 gene encodes an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronan, a component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. The scientists found that the gene mutations destabilize the molecule and reduce the protein levels, which may lead to the development of orofacial clefts. They also discovered that cor triatriatum, a rare heart defect in which the left atrium is divided into two separate chambers, is associated with these mutations. These findings suggest that the proper functioning of the HYAL2 gene and hyaluronan turnover are crucial for normal development of the heart and facial structures.
The inner ear's hair cells convert sound waves into electrical currents, but how they do this is not well understood. A protein complex that forms tip links between hair cells may be involved in this process. Scientists have found that this protein complex contains two proteins: cadherin 23 (CDH23) and protocadherin 15 (PCDH15). They have also found that tip links can be regenerated after they are disrupted, and that this regeneration involves a hitherto unknown remodeling mechanism. The scientists used a technique called backscatter electron scanning microscopy (BSEM) to image the surface of hair cells and their tip links. They found that nascent tip links had PCDH15 at both ends of the link. These links mediated mechanosensory current with a normal amplitude but abnormal adaptation (a change in response to repeated stimuli). Only later, the heteromeric PCDH15–CDH23 composition of tip links was re-established, and the normal adaptation of mechanosensory current was recovered. These findings suggest that tip links may have a different molecular composition during their regeneration. The scientists used whole-cell patch clamp recordings to measure the mechanosensory currents in hair cells. They found that disruption of tip links caused a decrease in the mechanosensory current, but that this decrease was not permanent. Instead, it was temporary and later recovered. These results suggest that tip links are not stable structures, but that they are remodeled during their regeneration. The scientists used immunolabeling to visualize the location of PCDH15 and CDH23 on the surface of hair cells and along the length of tip links during their regeneration. They found that nascent tip links had PCDH15 at both ends of the link. These links mediated mechanosensory current with a normal amplitude but abnormal adaptation. Only later, the heteromeric PCDH15–CDH23 composition of tip links was re-established, and the normal adaptation of mechanosensory current was recovered. These findings suggest that tip links may have a different molecular composition during their regeneration. Overall, these results provide new insights into the mechanism of tip link regeneration and their role in mechanosensory transduction.
This study is a metabolomic investigation of sera from adult dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever patients at the critical and recovery phases of infection. The study identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF at the critical phase, which include bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were observed to be up to 5-fold higher levels among DHF compared to DF patients and were significantly correlated to higher levels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase, suggesting liver injury among DHF. Uric acid, the most abundant antioxidant in the blood, was observed to be 1.5-fold lower among DHF compared to DF patients. This could result in decreased capacity of endogenous antioxidant defense and elevated oxidative stress among DHF patients. In the recovery phase, the levels of eight metabolites were still significantly higher or lower among DHF, including chenodeoxyglycocholic acid, one of the bile acids observed at the critical phase. This indicates potential prolonged adverse impact on the liver due to DENV infection in DHF patients. The study identified altered metabolic pathways linked to DHF in the critical and recovery phases of dengue infection and provided insights into the different host and DENV interactions between DF and DHF. The results advance our understanding on the mechanisms of DHF pathogenesis, alluding to possible novel therapeutic targets to dengue management.
GMPRs are enzymes that convert guanosine monophosphate (GMP) into inosine monophosphate (IMP), which is essential for the salvage of purine nucleotides. In this study, we identified and characterized GMPRs in T. brucei. We used a metabolic engineering approach to identify putative GMPR genes in T. brucei, and we cloned and expressed a recombinant enzyme. We showed that the recombinant enzyme had the same kinetic properties as GMPRs in mammals. We also showed that the enzyme was localized in the cytoplasm of T. brucei. Our results suggest that the metabolism of purine nucleotides in T. brucei may be similar to that in mammals.
This study uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding and transport of two drugs, benzocaine and phenytoin, in the bacterial sodium channel NaChBac. The results suggest that both drugs bind in a similar location in the pore and that they can leave the channel via the hydrophobic route, which may explain the known pharmacological effects of these drugs.
The immune system is an essential network of cells and molecules that defend against invading pathogens and maintain homeostasis within the body. The host response to infections involves various immune cell types, such as dendritic cells (DC), monocytes/macrophages (MO/Mφ), and T cells, which work together to clear the pathogen and initiate adaptive immunity. Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) is a key adaptor protein involved in the signaling of Toll-like receptors (TLR) and IL-1R family members. MyD88-deficient mice are more susceptible to infections and show impaired host defense against various pathogens. In this study, the authors generated cell type-specific MyD88-deficient mice using Cre/LoxP recombination technology. They found that MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ MO/Mφ was sufficient to protect mice from early death during infection with Citrobacter rodentium, a bacterial enteropathogen. In contrast, MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ DC and T cells was not required for protection during the early phase of infection. The authors also found that MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ DC and IEC was important for maintaining epithelial barrier integrity during infection. Together, these findings highlight the importance of MyD88 in different immune cell types for host defense against pathogens and the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity.
This paper describes a simulation model that was developed to investigate the relationship between the antibody serostatus of children and the overall onchocerciasis infection situation in a population, as determined by the number of mf in the skin (microfilarial load, MFL) and the community microfilarial load (CMFL). The model was based on the ONCHOSIM model, which was previously used to simulate the effects of ivermectin treatment on infection and transmission in onchocerciasis-endemic communities. The model was extended to include information on the Ov16 antibody serostatus of individuals, based on their history of infection. Three different hypotheses were tested to investigate the timing of the Ov16 antibody response in relation to the presence of mf in the skin: before the first mf are present, when the first mf are present, and after the first mf are present. The model was used to simulate 1,000 scenarios with different levels of transmission (annual biting rates), durations of mass treatment, and treatment coverage. The results showed that the antibody seroprevalence in children was strongly influenced by the transmission conditions and the duration of mass treatment. Under most scenarios, a high antibody seroprevalence in children was associated with a low probability of elimination of onchocerciasis. The model also predicted that antibody seroprevalence in children increased with age, which is consistent with field data from African onchocerciasis-endemic communities. Overall, the simulation model provides a useful tool for studying the relationship between antibody serostatus in children and the onchocerciasis infection situation in a population, and can help to inform decisions about the optimal duration of mass treatment to achieve elimination of onchocerciasis.
Here, we describe a study that explores the effects of swainsonine, a 2'-deoxyguanosine analogue, on the prion diseases that affect humans and animals. We show that swainsonine can change the properties of prion strains in cells, leading to the emergence of new prion strains with different characteristics. We also demonstrate that swainsonine can cause the misfolding of proteins, leading to the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins in cells. Our findings suggest that swainsonine may be a useful tool for studying the biology of prion diseases, and may also be useful for the development of new treatments for these diseases.
The paper by Reznik et al. titled "Networks of Metabolic Phenotypes" describes a new approach for the study of the interplay between genotype and metabolic phenotype in living organisms. Using the example of the E. coli metabolism, the authors study the properties of networks of metabolic phenotypes and their relationship to metabolic innovation. They show that metabolic phenotypes are organized in a way that facilitates metabolic innovation and that the genotype space can be used to predict metabolic phenotypes in different environments. The authors propose a method to generate the genotype-phenotype map and to identify the potential for metabolic innovation. Their findings provide insights into the metabolic properties of living organisms and have important implications for understanding the evolution of metabolism.
The present study uses DNA sequencing to characterize the genetic diversity and distribution of Trypanosoma dimidiata, a parasite transmitted by triatomine bugs, in Chiapas, Mexico. Triatomine bugs are common in sylvatic, ecotone, and human communities in Chiapas and have been linked to the transmission of Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of people worldwide. The study provides new insights into the genetic diversity and distribution of Trypanosoma dimidiata in the region and identifies potential associations between parasite genetic diversity and the human landscape. The study provides valuable information for the development of new Chagas disease control strategies in the region.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a zoonotic disease caused by hantaviruses. In this study, we aimed to quantify the relationships among environmental variables, rodent community composition, and human HFRS occurrence in Chenzhou City, Hunan Province, China. The annual environmental variables included precipitation, temperature, relative humidity, NDVI, and TVDI. Rodent community composition included the proportion of Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, Rattus flavipectus, and other rodent species. We found that Rattus norvegicus and Rattus flavipectus were the main rodent species associated with HFRS in Chenzhou City, and that temperature, relative humidity, NDVI, and TVDI were the most important environmental factors influencing rodent community composition. We also found that the occurrence of HFRS was associated with the rodent community composition, especially with Rattus norvegicus and Rattus flavipectus. This study highlights the importance of rodent community composition and environmental factors in the transmission of HFRS.
We have identified a novel, severe form of Costello syndrome caused by a particularly rare Glycine 12 Valine mutation in HRAS. Using a minigene reporter assay, we have demonstrated that the Glycine 12 Valine mutation abrogates formation of constitutively active p. Gly12Val HRAS in a CS patient by mediating pronounced exon 2 skipping. Moreover, we show that this vulnerability of HRAS exon 2 splicing can be exploited by employing splice switching oligonucleotides ( SSOs ) to induce HRAS exon 2 skipping. This provides proof of principle for a new mechanism for knocking out oncogenic HRAS, which may be used therapeutically to treat cancer.
This article presents a comprehensive analysis of Mettl3 knockout in mice, focusing on the effects on the cerebellum and the hematopoietic system. The study utilized a conditional knockout mouse line, where Mettl3 was knocked out in neural stem cells. This resulted in the death of these cells, leading to a reduction in cerebellar size and weight. Additionally, there was an increase in the number of immature hematopoietic stem cells, which were unable to differentiate into mature blood cells. The study also investigated the role of Mettl3 in the methylation of mRNA, as well as the stability and translation of these transcripts. The authors provide a detailed description of the experimental methods, including the use of molecular and cellular techniques. They also provide a thorough analysis of the data, with a focus on the implications for understanding the mechanisms of Mettl3 knockout on the cerebellum and hematopoietic system.
The paper describes a study of the role of combinatorial binding in enhancer function in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The authors used chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to identify transcription factor binding sites in ES cells and then compared them to genome-wide binding data from human ES cells and mouse embryonic carcinoma (EC/NCCIT) cells. They found that combinatorial binding of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog is strongly associated with co-localization of the transcriptional co-activator Mediator, H3K27ac, and increased expression of nearby genes. The authors then used gene ontology analysis to identify gene regulatory hotspots that are bound by multiple factors and are active in multiple tissues throughout early development. They found that combinatorial binding is critical for transcription in ES cells and likely plays an important role in embryogenesis by binding at conserved early developmental enhancers. The authors suggest that the evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding events, while “gene regulatory hotspots” that are bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues throughout early development are under stronger evolutionary constraints.
This research article describes the DNA binding pattern of a fusion protein called AML1/ETO, which is responsible for the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The researchers used a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to determine which regions of the genome the AML1/ETO protein binds to. They found that AML1/ETO preferentially binds to regions that are occupied by the wild-type AML1 transcription factor. They also showed that the DNA binding pattern of the E-box motif, a sequence of DNA that is recognized by a family of transcription factors, is reorganized following AML1/ETO expression. This research provides a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of AML, which can help inform the development of new therapies.
The present study provides evidence for a novel facet of chromatin regulation in the parasitic protozoon Leishmania donovani. The study identifies the LdHAT2 as a constitutively nuclear acetyltransferase that acetylates histone H4K10. The study also provides evidence for the essentiality of LdHAT2 in Leishmania parasites, as LdHAT2-hKO cells exhibit decreased growth rates and survival rates. The study further identifies LdHAT2 as a regulator of cell cycle progression, as LdHAT2-hKO cells exhibit extended G2/M phases and defective mitosis. The study also identifies the role of LdHAT2 in transcription regulation by identifying the LdHAT2-dependent acetylation of histones as a novel mechanism for the regulation of transcription. The study further identifies the role of LdHAT2 in DNA replication regulation by identifying the LdHAT2-dependent acetylation of histones as a novel mechanism for the regulation of DNA replication.
The present study uses computational modeling to examine how people learn about others' intentions and whether they take into account the volatility of these intentions. Participants played a game with another person, in which they had to decide whether to trust the other person's advice or to bet on their own preferences. The study compared a hierarchical Gaussian filter model and a response model with different decision strategies. The results of the study suggest that participants may use a hierarchical learning strategy to infer on others' intentions, but that they also consider non-social sources of information when making decisions. These results are consistent with the idea that people make decisions based on a combination of social and non-social sources of information, but that they may also take into account the volatility of others' intentions when doing so.
Scrub typhus is a vector-borne infectious disease caused by the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi. It has been a rural disease, but cases have been identified in urban areas as well. Scrub typhus can cause severe complications in some cases, such as heart failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Chigger mites, the vector of scrub typhus, are commonly found in forests and rural areas. However, a recent study identified chigger mites in an urban area in Seoul, South Korea, suggesting the potential for urban transmission. Chigger mites were collected using a direct chigger mite-collecting trap and identified using both morphological and genetic analysis. The collected mites were confirmed to be infected with O. tsutsugamushi based on genetic analysis of the 56-kDa antigen gene. This study provides evidence of the presence of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul and highlights the potential for urban transmission of the disease. It also highlights the importance of identifying and controlling the vector chigger mites to prevent the spread of the disease.
The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans possesses multiple RNA silencing pathways, which are endogenous and function in various cell types. These pathways regulate the transcription of many genes and their products are diverse. The authors of this study sought to understand the mechanisms underlying the regulation of small RNAs in these pathways. They found that one of the sRNAs involved in these pathways, the 26G RNA, is modified by the HENN-1 enzyme, which is homologous to human HEN1. This modification, which is the addition of a methyl group to the 2′-hydroxyl group of the terminal nucleotide of the sRNA, is important for the stability of the sRNA. The authors also found that HENN-1 is important for the regulation of the 21U RNA pathway, which is distinct from the 26G RNA pathway. The authors conclude that HENN-1 plays a role in regulating small RNAs in C. elegans and that its role is conserved in mammals.
In this study, the authors used data from three different population cohorts to investigate the genetic regulation of N-glycosylation, a process that adds complex sugar molecules to proteins. They used HPLC to quantify the levels of N-glycans in plasma samples from the three cohorts and then used genome-wide association studies to identify genetic variants that were associated with changes in N-glycan levels. The authors found that a common variant in the HNF1α gene was associated with changes in the levels of N-glycans that contain fucose, a type of glycan that is important for many biological processes. The authors also found that another variant, this time in the HNF4α gene, was associated with changes in the levels of N-glycans that contain galactose. These findings suggest that HNF1α and HNF4α may play important roles in regulating N-glycosylation and that genetic variants in these genes could lead to changes in N-glycan levels that are associated with disease.
The study provides evidence that the DNA-binding region of maize Centromere Protein C (CENPC) is located in the exon 12 region, and that this domain requires RNA binding for efficient centromere localization. The authors show that a truncated version of CENPC lacking exon 12 fails to localize efficiently to centromeres, but that the addition of the DNA-binding domain of HIV integrase restores localization. The authors further show that RNA facilitates the binding of CENPC to DNA in vitro, and that a 24 nt RNA derived from the Centromere repeat C (CentC) is sufficient to promote DNA binding. The authors propose that CENPC and RNA are a part of a template that directs CENH3 to newly replicated centromere DNA. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of centromere DNA recognition and replication.
Birth weight ( BW ) and childhood obesity are influenced by both fetal and maternal factors. Large genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified multiple genetic loci associated with BW , childhood obesity ( CO ), and childhood body mass index ( CBMI ). In addition, the placenta is a key organ for fetal growth and development, and is influenced by maternal genetics. This study used placental transcriptome and eQTLs in the analysis of GWAS loci associated with BW , CO , and CBMI . The study found that placental eQTLs were substantially enriched for GWAS loci associated with BW , CO , and CBMI . The study also found that eight transcripts were colocalized with BW risk loci, six transcripts were colocalized with CO risk loci, and one transcript was colocalized with CBMI risk loci. Overall, the study provides evidence that placental transcription may play a role in determining postnatal body size.
Kala-azar is a disease that can cause skin lesions that are difficult to treat and may last for a long time. It is important to diagnose these cases correctly so that they can receive proper treatment. This study aims to determine the prevalence of kala-azar in a certain area of West Bengal, as well as to determine the best way to diagnose these cases. The study also aims to determine whether treatment is effective and whether patients are cured. The study will use three different methods to diagnose kala-azar, including microscopy, a rapid test, and a molecular test. The study will also monitor the lesions of patients who are treated for kala-azar over a period of two years.
The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae has a way to respond to stresses in its environment and change its genetic program to survive. This change is called "competence" and it allows the bacteria to take up DNA from their environment and use it to make them stronger. The bacteria use a signaling molecule called ComX to coordinate the competence response in the entire population. Scientists have been studying how this signaling molecule works, but they have not been able to determine exactly how it is produced or how it is transmitted from cell to cell. In this study, scientists used different strains of pneumococcus and monitored their competence development. They found that competence development does not happen because the bacteria sense the environment and respond when the environment changes. Instead, competence development happens because certain cells within the population start to respond to the environment and then transmit that response to the rest of the population through a signaling molecule called CSP. The scientists also found that the competence development process is influenced by the growth stage of the bacteria. Overall, this study provides important insights into how the pneumococcus uses a signaling molecule to coordinate its response to stresses in its environment.
The bacterial virus HPV has a complex and fascinating life cycle. It targets basal keratinocytes of the skin, which are rapidly dividing cells that are constantly shedding and replenishing the skin. HPV is able to infect these cells because of their high rate of division. It also has a unique strategy for replicating itself: it uses a host enzyme called BirA to covalently label a small protein called E2 with a molecule called biotin. This allows the virus to hijack the cell's machinery to produce more viral particles. The authors of this study have made a number of important discoveries about this process. First, they found that the E2 protein is important for HPV to infect cells. They also found that a specific region of E2 is crucial for this function. Next, they discovered that BirA is important for the virus to replicate itself. They also found that a specific region of BirA is crucial for this function. Finally, they found that the virus can only replicate if the host cell is in a particular phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, these findings provide a detailed picture of how HPV is able to replicate itself and infect cells. This information could be useful for developing new treatments and vaccines against HPV.
The article you are referring to is a research article titled "Measuring the relative transmissibility of influenza strains" published in PLoS ONE in 2011. In this article, the authors develop a method to measure the transmission fitness of one strain of a pathogen compared to another. They apply their method to data from "competitive mixtures" experiments in which animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains. They observe the mixture in each animal over time and over multiple generations of transmission. They use data from influenza experiments in ferrets to demonstrate their approach. The authors note that their method is applicable beyond influenza to other viral and bacterial pathogens.
Researchers have found that a plant protein called BBX21 plays a role in both light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. The results of the study show that BBX21 works together with HY5, a transcription factor that is important for plant growth and development, to control light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis. This discovery could help to better understand how plants respond to different environmental cues and how they adapt to their environment.
Mediator is an important protein complex that is essential for transcription in yeast and humans. In this study, the authors investigate the role of Mediator in the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans. They find that Mediator has some conserved functions with S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but also has additional roles in the expression of virulence-related genes. The authors present a detailed analysis of the role of Mediator in the expression of cell wall adhesins and filamentation in C. albicans, which are important factors in the pathogenesis of this fungus. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of Mediator in the transcriptional regulation of virulence factors in C. albicans.
We found that the cellular state and multi-cellular interactions significantly influence the response to an antibiotic challenge, and that a large number of loci contribute to antibiotic tolerance in both the biofilm and planktonic states. We also identified mutations that contribute to antibiotic tolerance in the biofilm or planktonic state only, and observed a substantial connection between the cellular state and antibiotic tolerance. These results provide a rational foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against P . aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections.
We developed an algorithm, FAMoS (Flexible and dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection), that searches large model spaces in a dynamical way to find the best model for describing experimental data. The algorithm is based on backward- and forward search methods and includes a parameter swap search method. FAMoS can handle different model structures and is flexible in terms of the cost function used for model evaluation. We tested the algorithm using simulated data and showed its efficiency and flexibility for different model structures. We also used FAMoS to analyze experimental data on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell proliferation dynamics and showed that the algorithm was able to find important dynamical changes within the proliferation potential of cells within a tissue-like 3D ex vivo culture compared to a 2D suspension culture.
This study aimed to estimate the blood levels of parasitemia using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) during a 12-month follow-up in schoolchildren with recent chronic Chagas disease from the Bolivian National Chagas Program. The levels of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines were also estimated during the follow-up and compared to T . cruzi molecular detection outcomes to find out patterns of response to BNZ treatment. The study found that the parasitemia levels in children treated with BNZ decreased over time, and most of the children showed negative qPCR and cytokine results after 12 months of treatment. The results suggest that BNZ treatment may be effective in children with recent chronic Chagas disease, and that follow-up testing for parasitemia and cytokines can be used to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to develop more effective treatment strategies for Chagas disease.
We have analyzed the structure and transcriptional activity of the Correia elements (CEs) in the genome of N. meningitidis. The CEs are dispersed and amplified by transposition and DNA recombination and appear to influence their hosts in multiple ways. We have identified eight different subtypes of CE and shown that the strongest promoter is dictated by a recurrent single polymorphism in the −35 box of the terminal inverted repeat. The transcriptional activity of CEs is variable, with some CEs driving the transcription of adjacent genes and others potentially acting as termination signals. We have identified 343 almost-perfect CEs in the genomes of three N. meningitidis strains and analyzed the distribution and activity of the 114 α-rightY128T CEs. We have also analyzed the synteny of the N. meningitidis genomes and identified multiple regions of homology between them.
The article discusses the identification and characterization of LaeA and VelA, two fungal proteins that play a crucial role in asexual reproduction, melanin production, and virulence of the plant pathogen C. heterostrophus. The authors used several fungal strains, including wild-type and mutant strains, to study the function of these proteins. The results showed that both LaeA and VelA regulate asexual spore production, melanin biosynthesis, and virulence. The authors also demonstrated that both proteins are required for normal growth and development of C. heterostrophus, and that they interact with each other. The article provides important insights into the role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of C. heterostrophus, and highlights their potential as targets for the development of new fungicides.
Nav channels are a type of ion channel that allows certain types of ions (usually sodium or potassium) to move through them. Scientists have studied how these channels work by examining their crystal structures, using electrophysiology techniques, and running computer simulations. They have found that bacterial Nav channels have a different structure than mammalian Nav channels, and they have observed that K+ ions are not allowed to enter the channel in the direction of the membrane potential. To understand why this is happening, the scientists used computer simulations to study the movement of ions through the NavAb channel, a type of bacterial Nav channel. They found that two or three K+ ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter of the NavAb channel in the direction of the membrane potential, but not in the opposite direction. They also found that three Na+ ions move favorably through the selectivity filter together as a unit in a loose “knock-on” mechanism of permeation in both directions. These findings help us understand how ion selectivity works in Nav channels and why K+ ions are not allowed to enter the NavAb channel in the direction of the membrane potential.
In this study, the amount of rabies viral antigen in cell processes was compared to the amount of viral antigen in cell bodies in dogs with furious and paralytic forms of rabies. The study used specimens from 10 rabid dogs that were euthanized shortly after developing the first clinical sign. Measurements were taken at different levels of the spinal cord, brain stem, and cerebrum. Results showed that the amount of viral antigen in cell processes decreased in a rostral direction, following the pattern for the amount of viral antigen in cell bodies and the percentage of involved cell bodies. However, there was a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement, consistent with replication occurring in the cell body region and subsequent transport out to cell processes. Greater amounts of antigen were seen in cell processes in dogs with the furious compared to paralytic form, at all anatomic levels examined. These findings suggest that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form, resulting in slower viral propagation. Possible mechanisms might involve host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport.
The article "Insulator or enhancer blocking elements are proposed to play an important role in the regulation of transcription by preventing inappropriate enhancer/promoter interaction" describes the role of CTCF in transcription regulation in Drosophila melanogaster. CTCF is a DNA-binding protein that can act as an enhancer blocking factor in vertebrates. In Drosophila, CTCF has only been characterized recently, and only one endogenous binding location for CTCF has been identified in the genome. The study used chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites within representative regions of the Drosophila genome. The results show that CTCF binding sites correlate with boundaries of regulatory domains, allowing the location of three additional presumptive insulator elements. With the exception of Fab-7, the data indicate that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, suggesting that the functioning of these insulators involves a common CTCF-dependent mechanism. The study supports the domain model of BX-C regulation, which proposes that the genomic organization of transcriptional regulation is achieved by the precise expression of the Hox genes.
The study presented here provides a detailed mechanism for an induced-fit process at the atomic level, which is the key-lock binding process of a peptide deformylase enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPDF1B) in complex with its inhibitor actinonin. Using a combination of structural, biocomputing, and enzymatic analyses, the authors reveal that the free enzyme is in an open conformation, and that actinonin induces transition of the enzyme into a closed conformation. This process is further supported by kinetic analyses, which suggest that the induced-fit model is fully compatible with the observed experimental data. Moreover, the study provides evidence for the sequence of molecular events leading to the final, bound, closed complex (E:I*) and allows the reconstruction of a virtual “movie” recapitulating this mechanism. Taken together, this study sheds light on the mechanism of induced fit in enzyme inhibition and provides insights into how enzymes adapt to their ligands.
This work is about the transfer of information from retinal ganglion cells to cortical neurons, through a thalamic layer of neurons. The information transfer is described in terms of a mutual information, which is a measure of the similarity between two probability distributions. The authors study how this mutual information depends on the properties of the neurons in the thalamic layer, such as their connectivity patterns and their membrane potential dynamics. They use a combination of experimental data from in vitro recordings of neurons and computational models of neural circuits to investigate these properties. The authors also use Bayesian inference to estimate the parameters of their computational models, which allow them to predict how the mutual information depends on different parameters.
The article describes a genetic screen in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that identifies the role of the NMAD-1 protein in meiosis, a stage of cell division essential for producing haploid gametes. The authors use RNA interference to knock down the expression of NMAD-1, resulting in defects in meiotic chromosome segregation and increased production of mitotic cells, leading to sterility. They also show that NMAD-1 interacts with other proteins to form a complex that is important for proper meiotic progression.
This study shows that the protein APMAP can be used as a receptor for the HCMV pentamer complex in cells. The authors demonstrate that APMAP can bind to pentamers at low pH, which may be more efficient than at neutral pH. They also show that APMAP can facilitate HCMV entry into cells, but that its function is not essential for virus entry. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms of HCMV entry into cells and may have implications for the development of new antiviral therapies.
In this study, researchers developed a mathematical model to explain how differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into different cell types can be influenced by both extrinsic (cytokine) and intrinsic (transcription factor) factors. The model includes positive feedback loops for receptor and transcription factor activation, which can lead to multistability, meaning that the cell fate can be stable in one state or another depending on the initial conditions and external stimuli. The researchers used the model to show that the strength of cross-antagonism between transcription factors can be a critical determinant in achieving multistability. They also showed that noise in the network can enable stochastic switching between the stable states, but that external cues can still strongly bias the distribution of the uncommitted population among the various states during differentiation. Finally, the model captured both classical and alternative modes of lineage commitment seen in hematopoiesis.
The study presents an electron cryo-microscopy analysis of the BUNV virus, a member of the Orthobunyavirus genus, which is associated with minimal pathogenicity to humans and animals. The structure of the BUNV virion was analyzed using tomographic reconstruction at two different pH levels, and it was found that the Gn and Gc glycoprotein spikes of BUNV form a tripod-like structure. The study also provided a three-dimensional model of the BUNV glycoprotein spike at a resolution of 3.0 nm. The findings of this study provide a structural blueprint of this unique group of emerging viruses.
A study was done to find new genes that increase the risk of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG). PACG is a major cause of blindness, especially in Asian countries. The study looked at a specific part of the eye, called the anterior chamber depth (ACD), and found that this was a risk factor for PACG. The study found a new gene, called ABCC5, that is associated with PACG and ACD. The study then looked at PACG cases and controls to see if this gene was also associated with PACG. The results of the study suggest that genetic sequence variants may influence anterior chamber dimensions, which could increase the risk of PACG.
In this study, the authors report the identification of two conserved regulatory elements (Bicore1 and Bicore2) in both deuterostomes (e.g., humans and sea urchins) and protostomes (e.g., flies and mollusks) that encode regulatory sequences for the development of the neural tube and the segmentation of the developing neural tube. These regulatory elements were identified by screening a large number of bilaterian genomes and using comparative genomics techniques. The authors demonstrated that the two regulatory elements are highly conserved across different species and have been maintained throughout evolution. The study provides new insights into the conservation of developmental regulatory mechanisms in bilaterians.
Influenza viruses are constantly evolving and changing, making it difficult to predict which strains will cause outbreaks in the future. This study used next-generation sequencing to characterize influenza virus populations in patients with influenza-like illness during the 2004-2008 influenza seasons. The study found that vaccine-induced immunity had little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection, and that vaccine-induced antibodies did not seem to be major contributors to antigenic drift at the local scale. The study suggests that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at the host population level, and that the source of antigenic variation is ultimately at the level of the individual host. The findings of this study have important implications for influenza vaccine development and for our understanding of the evolution of influenza viruses.
This study aimed to investigate the immunogenic profile of LdCen-/- parasites in aged mice and compare it with that in young mice in terms of both innate and adaptive immune response. The study showed that LdCen-/- infection significantly enhanced production of pro-inflammatory response in both age groups compared to LdWT parasite infection. Further, LdCen-/- infected BMDCs derived from both young and aged mice were able to promote the proliferation of OVA-specific CD4+T cells and induced strong Th1 type immune responses in vitro . Similarly, parasitized splenic dendritic cells isolated from LdCen-/- infected young and aged BALB/c mice after 4 days of infection displayed up-regulation of many proinflammatory cytokine genes along with generation of enhanced CD4+Th1 response compared to LdWT infected mice . In vivo studies further showed that immunization with LdCen-/- protected both young and aged mice from a challenge with virulent L . donovani parasites via generating enhanced Th1 predominant immune response along with generation of NO from restimulated splenocytes . Comparison of both innate and adaptive immune response showed that aged animals induced lower adaptive response with no change in the innate response . The reduced adaptive immune response correlated with satisfactory but reduced protection in aged mice compared to young mice upon virulent L . donovani challenge .
This study investigates the molecular basis of the virulence and tissue tropism differences between EV-D68 and EV-D94. Two chimeric viruses, EV-D68P1VP1D94 and EV-D94P1VP1D68, were constructed by swapping the P1 regions of both viruses. These viruses were then tested in vitro in HeLa, RD, Vero, Caco-2, and SH-SY5Y cells, as well as in vivo in MucilAir, EpiIntestinal, and 3D neural tissues. The chimeric viruses displayed properties intermediate between those of the parental viruses, suggesting that the P1 region plays a crucial role in virulence and tissue tropism. The study also found that EV-D68 was better adapted to 37°C and EV-D94 to 33°C, providing further evidence for the role of the P1 region in temperature adaptation. These findings could help in the development of new strategies for the treatment and prevention of enterovirus infections.
The HSV-1 glycoprotein D (gD) is a protein found on the surface of the HSV-1 virus. It interacts with the human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, which is produced by the body in response to the virus. This interaction can lead to a process called antibody-binding protein inhibition (BPI), which prevents the antibody from binding to the virus and stopping the infection. In this study, the authors wanted to understand how the gD protein and IgG antibody interacted and whether this interaction could be used to treat HSV-1 infections. To do this, they used a technique called antibody-binding protein inhibition (BPI) to study how the gD protein and IgG antibody interact. They found that the gD protein and IgG antibody interacted and that this interaction could be used to treat HSV-1 infections.
In this study, we focused on the role of ESPs released by PSCs and their potential roles in the metabolic adaptation of parasites to their hosts. We suggest that intracellular ESPs are essential to the metabolism of carbohydrates within their hosts and that various molecular chaperones with a high level of expression may play a role in resisting harsh host environments. We also reveal a set of antigenic ESPs that show promise as candidates for vaccine development or in the development of serodiagnostic markers. Such findings will encourage more novel strategies for the treatment and control of CHD. Introduction: Cystic hydatid disease (CHD) is a serious parasitic zoonosis caused by the larval stages of Echinococcus granulosus (E . granulosus), a cestode that poses a threat to public health as well as significant economic losses [1] , [2] , [3] . At present, more than 3 million people are infected with this parasite [4] , [5] , and the prevalence reaches 10% in some areas [6] , [7] . The disease is difficult to control because appropriate diagnostic procedures are lacking and the available drugs are inefficient [8] . E . granulosus has a complex developmental cycle, involving eggs, oncospheres, protoscoleces (PSCs), and adult stages . Adult parasites live in the small intestine of dogs . After sexual maturation, numerous eggs are produced by the adult parasites and are then excreted with the dog feces . In humans, eggs containing larvae are ingested and develop into larval stages, including PSCs, in the liver and lungs of intermediate hosts [9] , [10] . Hydatid cysts (the larval stage or metacestode) develop in the internal organs of intermediate hosts, primarily in the liver and lungs [11] , [12] . The larval stages of E . granulosus are composed of two layers of cyst wall: cyst fluid and PSCs [9] . As the only infectious form of the larval stages, PSCs can interact with both definitive and intermediate hosts [9] . After sexual maturation, adult worms are released from the cysts and then excreted with the dog feces . They can also differentiate into new cysts when released into the body cavity of intermediate hosts upon cyst rupture [10] . Mouse models of CHD are often established via the intraperitoneal inoculation with PSCs , a method that has been widely applied to drug screening and vaccine development [11] , [12] . Understanding the elaborate immune evasion strategies and mechanisms of physiological adaptation of the PSCs is critical to ascertain effective intervention targets to control the prevalence of the parasite . In this study, we focus on the role of ESPs released by PSCs and their potential roles in the metabolic adaptation of parasites to their hosts. We suggest that intracellular ESPs are essential to the metabolism of carbohydrates within their hosts and that various molecular chaperones with a high level of expression may play a role in resisting harsh host environments. We also reveal a set of antigenic ESPs that show promise as candidates for vaccine development or in the development of serodiagnostic markers. Such findings will encourage more novel strategies for the treatment and control of CHD. Materials and Methods: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations provided in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Parasitic Diseases , Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CCDC ) . The protocol was approved by the Laboratory Animal Welfare & Ethics Committee ( LAWEC ) , National Institute of Parasitic Diseases , Chinese Center for Diseases Control and Prevention ( Permit Number: IPD 2011-006 ) . Hydatid cysts were collected from the livers of a naturally infected sheep in a slaughterhouse in Qinghai , China . Cyst fluid containing PSCs was sucked out of the cysts using a sterile syringe . After natural sedimentation for 10 min , PSCs were carefully collected from the sediment of cyst fluids and washed 10 times with saline solution . We then added 2 mL of Trizol reagent ( Invitrogen , USA ) to the well-washed PSCs . After continuous mixing with a pipette , the PSCs were stored at −80°C prior to use . Genomic DNA from the PSCs was extracted using the DNeasy tissue kit ( TaKaRa Biomedicals , Tokyo , Japan ) and used as a template for a polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) [25] . The following two primer pairs were used to amplify the mitochondrial genes of Echinococcus species: cytochrome coxidase subunit 1 ( cox1 ) gene ( F: 5′-TTGAATTTGCCACGTTTGAATGC-3′; and R: 5′-GAACCTAACGACATAACATAATGA-3′ ) and cytochrome b ( cytb ) gene ( F: 5′-GTCAGATGTCTTATTGGGCTGC-3′; R: 5′-TCTGGGTGACACCCACCTAAATA-3′ ) .

Here we report that the oxidation state of a conserved methionine within the NirA NES is correlated with the subcellular distribution and transcriptional competence of the protein. We investigated the cognate oxido-reduction switch and based on genetic and biochemical data, we propose a role of an hitherto uncharacterised central domain of NirA which, interacting with the C-terminal activation domain, determines the accessibility of the NES in response to the oxido-reduction switch. Our findings indicate that NirA not only determines the subcellular localization of its target genes but also their transcriptional competence.
Sodium channels are vital for transmitting electrical signals in the nervous system and other tissues. Mathematical models suggest that the properties of sodium channels are tightly constrained to allow for efficient signal transmission. The study found that the simplest theoretical constraints bound sodium channel diversity, namely, the requirement for membrane excitability and a unique resting potential. The study also found that the excitability properties alone distinguished the nine sodium channels into four different groups. The groups were based on the type of tissue where the channels were expressed and had different functional properties. The study used a dataset with measurements of mammalian sodium channels to test the theoretical predictions. The findings of the study suggest that sodium channel diversity is constrained by simple theoretical bounds and has evolved to perform specialized tasks in different tissues.
In this paper, the authors present the crystal structures of the influenza A (H1N1) virus endonuclease protein in complex with four inhibitors. The structures are resolved using X-ray crystallography and provide insight into the binding modes of these compounds. The authors also present a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to investigate the antiviral activity of these compounds against influenza A (H3N2) virus. The results show that the compounds exhibit potent antiviral activity, with IC50 values ranging from 0.004 to 0.38 μM. Overall, this paper provides valuable information for the design and development of new antiviral drugs against influenza virus.
Snake envenomation is a serious health problem in many poor tropical countries. Effective antivenoms are considered to be the only rational and effective treatment for envenomation by snakes. In recent years, studies on various research fronts have been conducted to improve the potency and availability of antivenoms. It has been shown that complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) can produce potent antisera against venom toxins, but it also causes severe local reactions in horses, limiting the use of this adjuvant. A low dose, low volume, multi-site immunization protocol has been developed that uses incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) and produces potent antisera against venom toxins with minimal side effects. The aim of this study was to use this immunization protocol to produce potent polyspecific antisera against three medically important vipers in Thailand and its neighboring countries. The immunization protocol yielded potent polyspecific antisera against the three vipers. The horses did not suffer from severe local reactions, allowing the use of CFA without the side effects. The horses responded well to the immunization protocol, producing high titer antibodies within three months. The antibodies produced by the horses neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, and necrotic activities of the venoms. These results suggest that the low dose, low volume, multi-site immunization protocol with IFA is a safe and effective method for producing potent polyspecific antisera against medically important vipers in Thailand and its neighboring countries.
Salmonella is an important human and animal pathogen that causes foodborne illnesses. Infection by Salmonella can lead to bacteremia, which is the presence of the bacteria in the bloodstream. Salmonella is able to survive and replicate inside macrophages, which are immune cells that are supposed to kill the bacteria. We have found that a protein called IQGAP1 is important for the ability of Salmonella to survive and replicate inside macrophages. IQGAP1 is a cytoskeletal protein that is involved in the regulation of cell motility and adhesion. We have shown that Salmonella is able to block the ability of IQGAP1 to regulate cell motility and adhesion, which allows the bacteria to survive and replicate inside macrophages. We have also shown that IQGAP1 is required for the ability of macrophages to kill Salmonella. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of host-pathogen interaction and may lead to the development of new therapies for Salmonella infection.
Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is a significant cause of social and public health problems worldwide. CA-MRSA is less virulent and more susceptible to antibiotics than hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). CA-MRSA has a type IV pilus, which facilitates the formation of biofilms, allowing the bacteria to survive under hostile environments. SCCmec is a mobile genetic element (MGE) that encodes the methicillin resistance gene (mecA), which renders MRSA resistant to methicillin. However, the genetic determinants of the differences between HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA are unclear. Therefore, in this study, we examined the genetic and functional differences between CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA. We compared the genomes of CA-MRSA strain RN4220 and HA-MRSA strain ATCC 43300 by DNA microarrays and identified several genetic differences. We further examined the functional differences of these strains by in vitro and in vivo experiments. Our results indicated that RN4220 was less virulent and more susceptible to antibiotics than ATCC 43300. We also found that the mutations in the mecA gene and the type IV pilus in RN4220 were responsible for its differences from ATCC 43300. Our study provided insights into the genetic and functional differences between CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA, which may lead to new strategies for controlling CA-MRSA.
The ADE model of dengue infection has been reproduced in A129 mice, which lack type I interferon receptors but have intact IFNγ signaling pathway. Mice born to DENV1-immune mothers displayed enhanced disease severity, including death, increased viremia, and severe liver damage upon DENV2 infection. The detrimental role of TNFα in this model was demonstrated. The study shows that the IFNγ signaling pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of dengue infection in the context of ADE, and highlights the potential of TNFα inhibition as a therapeutic strategy.
This article is a systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with Leishmania infantum infection in humans in the Americas. The authors searched for articles that investigated the association between different variables and L. infantum infection. They included 51 studies in their review, covering different regions of the Americas. The authors found that male sex, younger age, having dogs at home, and living in highly vegetated areas were associated with L. infantum infection. However, they noted that more research is needed to investigate the associations between other variables, such as presence of chickens in the house and nutritional status, and L. infantum infection. The authors also highlighted the importance of improving the quality of future studies in order to better understand the determinants of infection acquisition and disease development.
The immune response to Francisella tularensis infection involves a range of cells, including alveolar macrophages (AM), dendritic cells (DC), neutrophils, and T cells. While the role of T cells in the immune response is well-known, the role of other immune cells, such as AM and DC, is less clear. Recent studies have shown that during F. tularensis infection, AM and DC undergo a process called myeloid cell differentiation, which is characterized by changes in cell morphology and function. Myeloid cells differentiation is driven by the cytokines interferon-γ (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), which are produced by T cells and other immune cells. Myeloid cell differentiation is associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as increased bacterial killing and clearance. However, this process can also lead to depletion of AM and DC, which can compromise the immune response and contribute to the development of acute F. tularensis infection.
The Asian tiger mosquito (Ae. albopictus) is a major disease vector capable of transmitting multiple arboviruses, including Zika, Dengue, and Chikungunya. Invasive populations of Ae. albopictus have spread rapidly worldwide through human-mediated transportation. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the demographic history of Ae. albopictus populations in different regions using microsatellite markers. The study shows that the invasion process of this mosquito was primarily supported by a chaotic propagule distribution, which cooperates in maintaining a relatively high genetic diversity within adventive populations. The study also identifies independent and trans-continental introductions as major factors contributing to the rapid establishment of invasive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes. The results of this study provide valuable information for developing models that may predict the risk of vector outbreaks.
In this study, we investigated the importance of various virulence and biofilm formation functions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wounds using a mouse model of wound infection. We found that many clinical isolates from chronic wound infections are defective in virulence and biofilm formation functions, which could contribute to their chronic nature. We also identified selective conditions in chronic wounds that favor biofilm formation and that may contribute to the treatment-resistant nature of chronic wound infections. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding bacterial functions in chronic wound infections and suggest that targeted therapies that disrupt biofilm formation and/or virulence functions may be effective in treating chronic wound infections.
The study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of intrascrotal lymphangiectasia (dilated lymphatic vessels) in hydrocele patients living in a filariasis-endemic area and the morphology and consistency of the testicles after hydrocelectomy. The study included 968 patients with uni- or bilateral hydrocele who underwent hydrocelectomy at the Center for Teaching, Research, and Tertiary Referral for Bancroftian Filariasis (NEPAF). The authors compared the hydrocelectomy technique used in this study with a comparison group of 218 patients who had undergone hydrocelectomy elsewhere. The authors found that there was no difference in the occurrence of intrascrotal lymphangiectasia between the two groups. The morphology and consistency of the testicles were also found to be similar between the two groups. The authors concluded that complete excision of hydrocele sac is an effective technique and that it is important to identify and suture or excise any leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels found in the area of the hydrocele sac or in the surrounding tissue.
This study reports the identification and characterization of a putative DUB from the nematode parasite Trichinella spiralis. The DUB is the first to be reported from T. spiralis and is putatively orthologous to human UCHL5. The DUB associates with the proteasome and can be specifically inhibited by a UCH inhibitor compound. The study also reports the use of activity-based probes to identify DUBs in T. spiralis worm extract and provides evidence that the deubiquitinating activity is present in the L1 larval stage of T. spiralis.
Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a significant public health problem in Latin America and is caused by the protozoan parasite T . cruzi . Current therapy is limited and is associated with side effects that may impair therapy and is only effective in the acute phase of the disease. Cruzipain, a cysteine protease expressed by T . cruzi, is a validated target for therapeutic intervention. This study investigated two scaffolds associated with cathepsin K inhibition, nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors and cyclohexane dicarboxamide derivatives, to determine their anti-trypanosomal activity and potential as therapeutics for Chagas disease.
The physical map of a genome is a critical resource for genomic analysis and assembly. We present an integrated physical map of the maize genome constructed from large-insert BAC libraries and high information content fingerprint data. The map was developed using a combination of manual and automated methods and incorporates genetic markers, sequence-based markers, and comparative analysis with rice. The resulting map has a high level of resolution and contiguity and is publicly available.
This study aimed to investigate the possibility of generating infectious prion protein (PrPSc) in vitro, without the need for pre-existing PrPSc. To achieve this, the authors modified the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique to remove any possible contamination with PrPSc. In vitro-generated PrPSc was then inoculated into wild type hamsters, which developed a new disease phenotype with unique clinical, neuropathological and biochemical features. The findings suggest that prion diversity is not limited to those currently known and that new forms of infectious protein foldings may be produced, resulting in novel disease phenotypes.
We propose a neural model for the honeybee’s angle velocity estimator circuit. We use electrophysiological data from the literature to constrain the model, and we test the model using simulated bees in a corridor-centering paradigm. We find that the model produces similar deviations from perfect centering as the real bees, and we propose a mechanism for integrating the outputs of the model to estimate distance traveled in the corridor. We show that our model successfully reproduces the behavior of real bees in the corridor-centering paradigm.
In the present study, the authors report on a long-term follow-up (15 years) of a cohort of 50 patients who were initially diagnosed with human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). The study aimed to investigate the progression of HAT in patients who refused treatment after their initial diagnosis. The study found that in 10 of the 11 patients who continued to refuse treatment despite repeated visits, parasite clearance was observed using both microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of these patients also displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming progressively negative to trypanosome variable antigens. Therefore, the study demonstrated that alternative progressions of HAT may occur in addition to the "classic" lethal outcome of HAT. These alternative progressions include progression to an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection associated with strong long-lasting serological responses, and progression to an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection associated with a progressive drop in antibody titres as observed in treated cases. The authors conclude that the recognition that trypanotolerance exists in humans is a major step forward for future research in the field of HAT.
The study aims to determine whether ionizing radiation selects for cells with mutations that disrupt the p53 tumor suppressor gene in vivo. The researchers found that p53 disruption does not provide a clear selective advantage in an unstressed hematopoietic system or in previously irradiated bone marrow allowed to recover from irradiation. However, p53 disruption confers a dramatic selective advantage following irradiation, leading to long-term expansion of p53-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. The selective advantage is attributed to several factors, including protection from acute radiation-induced ablation of progenitor cells, prevention of irradiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor cells, improved long-term maintenance of progenitor cell fitness, and the disabling or elimination of competing p53 wild-type progenitors. These findings suggest that the carcinogenic effect of ionizing radiation can in part be explained by increased selection for cells with p53 disruption, which protects progenitor cells from immediate elimination and from long-term reductions in fitness following irradiation.
The parasitic helminth Schistosoma mansoni causes severe and long-term inflammation in its human host, resulting in severe pain and disability. However, the host immune response to this parasite is not fully understood. In this study, we used a novel approach to study the role of the host immune system in schistosome infection. We identified a new inhibitor of the neutrophil elastase enzyme, which is involved in the host immune response to Schistosoma infection. We then tested the effects of this inhibitor on the host immune response and found that it reduced inflammation in vitro and in vivo.
A novel method is presented for generating highly accurate homology models of transmembrane proteins, which are essential for understanding the function and structure of proteins with unknown 3D structures. By using this method, a set of 50 transmembrane protein structures were reconstructed from 30 unique target sequences with 3D structures. The results of this study demonstrate that this method is capable of generating high-quality homology models for transmembrane proteins.
Listeria monocytogenes is a human pathogen that causes the disease listeriosis, which can be fatal in vulnerable populations such as newborns, pregnant women, and older adults. This pathogen is an intracellular parasite that invades and multiplies within immune cells such as macrophages. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms used by L. monocytogenes to persist inside human cells. We found that L. monocytogenes switches from a motile, invasive phenotype to a nonmotile, intracellular phenotype after a period of infection. This switch is associated with a reduction in the expression of virulence factors, including the motility and adhesion proteins ActA and InlA. We also found that L. monocytogenes can accumulate in vacuoles called lysosome-associated membrane vesicles (LAMVs), which can provide a protective environment for the bacteria to survive and replicate. The presence of LAMVs was associated with reduced expression of the host protein ATG7, which is required for autophagy-mediated clearance of intracellular pathogens. Overall, our findings suggest that L. monocytogenes employs various strategies to persist inside human cells, including a switch in virulence factor expression and the ability to accumulate in LAMVs. These insights into the mechanisms of L. monocytogenes infection may help guide the development of new therapeutic strategies to treat this pathogen.
This article presents a mathematical model of auditory perception in the context of bistable hearing. The authors propose a model that integrates auditory competition and perception into a single framework, allowing them to use a generative model to simulate and predict the duration of auditory percepts. The model is based on a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and incorporates features such as noise, adaptation, and lateral inhibition. The authors compare their model to experimental data from human subjects and demonstrate that it can accurately capture the durations of auditory percepts across a wide range of conditions. The model also predicts that the distribution of percept durations should follow a gamma distribution, a prediction that is supported by experimental data. Overall, the authors argue that their model provides a more comprehensive and realistic account of auditory perception than previous models, and that it has important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying bistable hearing.
We describe a novel detection system for antigen-specific IgE that utilizes a humanised rat basophilic leukaemia cell line ( RS-ATL8 ), in combination with a cell-free expression system and a set of stringent quality controls. We demonstrate proof-of-principle of how this technology paves the way for genome-wide assessment of Schistosoma allergens - the Schistosoma allergome.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of transposable elements (TEs) in hybrid dysgenesis, a phenomenon where offspring of certain interspecific crosses fail to reproduce due to genome activation of TEs paternally inherited from one parental species. The authors analyze the dysgenic syndrome in Drosophila virilis, a species that has a highly diverse TE landscape and differs from its closest relatives by only a few million years. They find that multiple TEs are activated in the germline of dysgenic females, with increased TE expression coinciding with increased germline piRNA production. This activation leads to increased non-TE gene expression and is associated with a unique pattern of trans-generational gene regulation by genic piRNAs that arise from polymorphic TE insertions. The authors propose that differences in the TE profile between strains can influence patterns of TE and gene expression across generations via piRNAs. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying hybrid dysgenesis and the consequences of accumulating differences in the TE landscape between populations.
A common inherited neurological disorder called Fragile X tremor-ataxis syndrome (FXTAS) results from an expanded repeat of the CGG trinucleotide sequence in the FMR1 gene. Previous studies suggested that the expanded repeat generates abnormal RNA that may be toxic. Here, researchers use Drosophila and cellular models to show that the expanded repeat generates abnormal RNA that may be toxic, but that a pharmacological intervention can suppress this toxicity. Specifically, they found that overexpression of HDAC6 in Drosophila and human cell lines suppresses the toxicity of the expanded repeat in a manner consistent with a reduction in abnormal RNA. These findings suggest that abnormal RNA generated from expanded CGG repeats may be responsible for the neurological symptoms of FXTAS, and that pharmacological intervention can suppress these symptoms by reducing the abnormal RNA. This work has important implications for understanding the molecular basis of FXTAS and for developing treatments for this condition.
In a study published in the journal "Frontiers in Immunology," the authors examined how the host immune response influences the development of chronic viral infection. They used two types of mice, one with specific MHC alleles and one with increased MHC heterogeneity, to examine the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the development of chronic viral infection. They found that both increased MHC heterogeneity and MHC diversity are associated with enhanced CD8 T cell responses and viral control during chronic infection. Additionally, they found that mortality in Cl-13-infected mice on a C57BL genetic background was CD8 T-cell-dependent. They also found that Cl-13-infected D2B6F1 mice exhibited more CD8 T cell effector cytokine production and reduced expression of the T cell exhaustion marker PD-1. Furthermore, D2B6F1 mice also induced a larger Th1 response than BCF1 mice, and Cl-13-induced mortality in D2B6F1 mice was also dependent on CD4 T-cell-mediated IFN-γ production. Overall, these findings suggest that the capacity to maintain a functional CD8 T cell response is vital for controlling chronic viral infection, but that constant CD8 T cell stimulation during chronic viral infection can drive CD8 T cells into a state of exhaustion, preventing effective clearance of infection.
This article presents the genetic characteristics of anthrax outbreaks in northwestern China over the past decade. The study used two genetic methods, canSNP and MLVA, to analyze 106 strains of Bacillus anthracis, including 13 DNA samples collected between 1990 and 2016. The study found that the B. anthracis populations in this region have been gradually diversifying. The study also provides preliminary survey results regarding the population diversity of B. anthracis in China. The findings of this study can help promote the prevention and control of anthrax in northwestern China.
C. rodentium is a type of bacteria that infects the intestinal lining of mice and humans. C. rodentium is a model for studying how intestinal pathogens interact with host immune cells. In the study, the authors found that C. rodentium infection causes damage to the colon of mice, and that the damage is prevented by administering RELM-β, a type of protein that is released by immune cells. They also found that RELM-β attracts CD4+ T cells to the site of infection, which help to prevent damage to the colon.
The article describes a series of experiments to study the interaction between the viral protein VPg and the eIF4G protein from host cells in a model of infection by the murine norovirus (MNV). The authors used a variety of techniques, including fluorescence spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography, to investigate the interactions between these proteins. The results suggest that the VPg protein may be important for the replication of MNV, and that it may interact with multiple host proteins, including eIF4G, eIF4A, and eIF3D. The authors also studied the effects of specific mutations in the VPg protein on its interactions with host proteins, and found that some mutations had significant effects on these interactions. Overall, the article provides important insights into the interactions between MNV and its host cells, and may help to identify potential targets for developing antiviral therapies for this important pathogen.
We have implemented the selfish operon model by re-implementing the original simulation and running it under a wide range of conditions. In addition, we have developed a new computational model based on a Moran process in which there is natural selection for gene clustering and rearrangement occurs by genome inversion events. Finally, we have developed a new computational model that tracks the occurrence and fixation of rearrangements while also considering natural selection. We found that gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions. Factors that promote the evolution of gene clusters include a low number of genes in the pathway, a high population size, and in the case of the selfish operon model, a high horizontal transfer rate. The computational analysis here has shown that the evolution of gene clusters can occur under both direct and indirect selection as long as certain conditions hold. Under these conditions, the selfish operon model is still viable as an explanation for the evolution of gene clusters.
Malaria is a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum and is responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in tropical regions of the world. It affects pregnant women, who are particularly vulnerable to severe consequences of the infection. The adhesion of infected red blood cells to the placenta is mediated by a unique variant of PfEMP1, called VAR2CSA, which binds to chondroitin sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblasts in the intervillous space of placentas. This adhesion is thought to be actively repressed in men, children, or non-pregnant women because the gene encoding VAR2CSA appears to contain a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) that acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA. The authors used cultured parasite lines and reporter gene constructs to show that the gene encoding VAR2CSA contains a small uORF that acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA, revealing a novel form of gene regulation in malaria parasites. The mechanism underlying this translational repression is reversible, allowing high levels of protein translation upon selection, thus potentially enabling parasites to upregulate expression of this variant antigen in the presence of the appropriate host tissue. These findings suggest that an additional level of regulation controls expression of the PfEMP1 variant associated with pregnancy associated malaria, perhaps to prevent its expression at times when no placenta is available for binding.
This study is about the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells of children with dengue virus infection. The researchers compared the transcriptional profiles of patients with different levels of disease severity. They found that there were different gene expression patterns in patients with different disease outcomes, including shock, hemorrhagic fever, and dengue fever. They also identified some commonalities in the gene expression patterns of different disease outcomes. The study highlights the importance of identifying differentially expressed genes in dengue virus infection and could help in developing new biomarkers and improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease outcomes.
Herpesviruses are a group of viruses that cause a wide range of diseases in humans and animals. They have been difficult to study because they are highly adapted to their host cells and are therefore difficult to infect in vitro. In this study, the authors used the mouse herpesvirus MuHV-4 to study how herpesviruses infect the nasal epithelium of the host. They found that the virus binds to heparan sulfate (HS) on the surface of epithelial cells and that HS is required for the virus to enter these cells. They also found that the virus binds to glycoproteins on the surface of ciliated cells and that these cells are required for the virus to infect the olfactory bulb of the host. This study provides important new insights into how herpesviruses infect their hosts.
Salmonella is a common cause of food poisoning. In order to survive in the host, Salmonella bacteria invade the intestinal cells using a special machine called the type III secretion system. One of the most important parts of this machine is a protein called HilD, which is controlled by the sensor protein CRP. We have discovered a new way that CRP controls HilD. It turns out that CRP and a small molecule called Spot 42 work together to shut down the production of HilD in the early stages of growth. This is important because HilD is needed later in growth to activate the type III secretion system. We have also found that Spot 42 controls HilD by binding to its 3’ end (the end that is farthest from the start). This is unusual because most sRNAs bind to the 5’ end of their targets. This new information helps us understand how Salmonella bacteria control the type III secretion system during their lifecycle in the host.
In this study, the authors investigated the relationship between chromatin structure, transcription and tissue-selective CAG instability using R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. These two lines have the same transgene, but differ in the integration site, resulting in the expression of a similar transgene at different levels. The authors found that instability rates are increased in R6/2 tissues compared to R6/1 matched samples. High transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility correlated with the increased CAG instability of R6/2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimethylation at the HD locus were increased in R6/2 tissues, whereas H3K9 dimethylation was reduced. However, the levels of transgene expression and these specific histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, two tissues showing very different CAG instability levels. The authors also found that the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at the HD locus, but not the initiating form of RNA Pol II, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. Similarly, H3K36 trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum and not in the cerebellum. Together, these data support the view that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability in vivo.
A study on the neurotropism of enterovirus 71 (EV71) in an immunocompromised patient is reported. The patient presented with severe meningitis and encephalitis. Five full-length EV71 genome sequences were generated from clinical samples. In a competitive neutralization assay, EV71 isolated from the patient was found to have a high affinity for mouse anti-EV71 monoclonal antibodies. The study then used infectious clone derivatives to analyze the viral characteristics. A substitution in the BC loop of the 2A protein (R2B38V) was found in one of the five clinical isolates. This substitution had no effect on the virus's growth in Vero cells, but it did increase its growth in SH-SY5Y cells, which are a neuroblastoma cell line. The substitution was also associated with increased neurovirulence in mice. The study then used molecular modeling to analyze the structure of the VP1 protein of EV71, which is the major viral capsid protein. The study found that the R2B38V substitution had a minimal effect on the overall structure of the VP1 protein. However, it did increase the solvent-accessible surface area of the BC loop region, which is important for virus-host interactions. Overall, the study provides insights into the molecular basis of EV71 neurotropism and suggests that substitutions in the BC loop of the 2A protein may play a role in viral pathogenesis.
Streptococcus mutans is a bacterial pathogen that is responsible for causing dental cavities. One of the most important features of S. mutans is its ability to form biofilms, which are communities of bacteria that adhere to each other and to surfaces. The ability to form biofilms is a key virulence factor for S. mutans, as it allows the bacteria to evade the host's immune system and persist in the oral cavity. To better understand how S. mutans forms biofilms, scientists are studying how the bacteria communicate with each other using a process called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing is a way for bacteria to sense the density of other bacteria in their environment, and it plays a key role in regulating the expression of genes that are important for biofilm formation and other functions. By studying quorum sensing in S. mutans, scientists are hoping to identify new targets for the development of drugs to treat dental cavities and other bacterial infections.
The authors used the yeast Candida albicans to study the DNA replication properties of centromeric DNA. By determining the genome-wide replication timing program of the C . albicans genome, they discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome . Importantly, epigenetic formation of new ectopic centromeres (neocentromeres) was accompanied by shifts in replication timing, such that a neocentromere became the first to replicate and became associated with origin recognition complex (ORC) components. Changing the level of the centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to a concomitant change in levels of ORC association with centromere regions, further supporting the idea that centromere proteins determine origin activity. Finally, the authors found a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins in centromere-associated DNA, which is conserved among related strains and species in a manner independent of primary DNA sequence.
This study aimed to identify genetic variants associated with chronic back pain (CBP) in adults of European ancestry from 16 community- and population-based cohorts. The study found three loci that reached genome-wide significance in a 2-stage joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant located between CCDC26 and GSDMC, an intronic variant in DCC, and an intronic variant in SOX5. The SOX5 variant was then replicated in 283,752 UKB participants not included in the discovery sample, exceeding genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis. The study also found suggestive associations at three other loci in the discovery sample that exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant between CCDC26 and GSDMC, an intronic variant in DCC, and an intronic variant in SOX5. These findings suggest that variants in these genes may play a role in the development of CBP. However, it is important to note that the study was based on a large number of participants and further research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the biological mechanisms underlying CBP.
Taenia solium cysticercosis is a common parasitic infection that affects both humans and pigs in many developing countries. This study aimed to calculate the impact of this disease on the people and economy of West Cameroon. The study used two approaches: cost estimation and Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) estimation. The cost estimation included the cost of lost productivity, cost of healthcare, cost of traditional medicine, and cost of lost animals. The DALY estimation was based on the number of years lost due to disability and premature death caused by the disease. The study estimated the cost of T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon to be €10,255,202, with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of €6,889,048 to €14,754,044. The cost of lost productivity was the highest (56.3%), followed by the cost of healthcare (17.4%) and cost of lost animals (14.1%). The cost of traditional medicine was only 5.7%. The DALY estimation showed that the average number of DALYs lost per thousand people per year was 9.0, with 95% CI of 2.8 to 20.4. This study provides an estimate of the cost and burden of T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon, which can be used to inform policy decisions and guide disease control efforts.
Staphylococcus aureus is a highly versatile pathogen capable of causing a wide range of infections, from mild skin infections to life-threatening pneumonia. An essential aspect of S. aureus pathogenicity is its ability to establish biofilms, communities of bacteria embedded in a matrix of extracellular material that resist treatment with antibiotics and other antimicrobials. A key feature of S. aureus biofilms is the presence of an extracellular RNA known as RsaA, which regulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Here, the authors describe the structure and function of RsaA and its derivatives, and its role in the regulation of biofilm formation and virulence in S. aureus. They show that RsaA forms an imperfect duplex with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in the 5′ region of mRNAs, which inhibits translation. They also demonstrate that RsaA regulates the expression of several key virulence factors, including the surface protein A (Spa) and the toxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), as well as the formation of biofilms. These findings suggest that RsaA plays an important role in the pathogenicity of S. aureus and that it may be a useful target for the development of new antibiotics.
We developed a novel system for tracking HIV-1 fusion to the cytoplasmic membrane of target cells. We used an oligomeric cyclophilin A-based fluorescent probe that specifically labels the core of the virus after fusion. Our results provide a detailed characterization of the HIV-1 fusion process, including the kinetics of core loss and the stability of the core in the cytoplasm. These findings should facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting the HIV-1 fusion process.
Here is a summary of the key points covered in the article:  * The authors compared the randomness and bias of oligonucleotide usage in prokaryotic genomes. * They found that GC-rich genomes were more biased and had less random oligonucleotide usage than AT-rich genomes. * They also found that the non-coding regions of prokaryotic genomes were more biased and had less random oligonucleotide usage than the coding regions. * They concluded that their findings suggest that the GC content of prokaryotic genomes may influence the degree of randomness and bias of oligonucleotide usage, and that these properties may also vary in coding and non-coding regions.
Meiotic recombination is an essential process that occurs during meiosis, the production of gametes in humans. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair and exchange genetic material through the formation of crossovers. However, not all genetic material is exchanged equally, and a phenomenon known as biased gene conversion occurs, which favors certain alleles over others. The goal of this study is to investigate the genetic factors that influence meiotic recombination at six highly active human recombination hotspots. The researchers used sperm DNA from multiple men to analyze both crossovers and noncrossovers, which are recombination events that do not exchange flanking markers. They found that there is a previously undetected type of biased gene conversion that favors strong over weak base pairs. This form of biased gene conversion is not predicted to influence hotspot activity but instead represents a previously unappreciated yet significant source of meiotic drive operating in the human genome.
We present a high confidence human protein-protein association network built upon the integration of chemical toxicology and systems biology. This computational systems chemical biology model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, thus predicting which compounds may be risk factors for human health. Additionally, the network can be used to identify unexpected potential associations between chemicals and proteins. We validate our network by comparison with two high confidence protein-protein interaction networks, and by assessing the functional enrichment of clusters in the network generated. The P-PAN revealed both known as well as many novel surprising connections between chemicals and diseases or proteins. We provide literature support for some of the unexpected associations, such as the connection between diethylhexylphthalate (DEHP) and gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor beta target. This illustrates the usefulness of an approach that integrates toxicogenomics data with other diverse data types.
The study explores how auditory cortical neurons can be modeled more effectively to understand how they process sound. The study proposes a new model called the network receptive field (NRF), which is composed of multiple sub-receptive fields that interact nonlinearly. The model was fitted to neural responses of ferrets to natural sounds and found to outperform traditional models. The NRF model can provide insights into the neural circuitry of auditory processing and may be useful for understanding complex neural processing in other areas of the brain.
In a study published in Molecular Cell Biology, researchers have investigated the role and mechanism of CK2-mediated BMAL1 phosphorylation in the circadian clock. They found that CK2 is a crucial component of the mammalian clock and that its activity is regulated by CRY1/2. The study provides important insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the mammalian clock and suggests that CK2 and CRY1/2 may be targets for therapeutic intervention in circadian rhythm disorders.
In this study, the authors report their findings on how Salmonella enterica, a common cause of food poisoning, adapts to and grows in the presence of bile salts, which are toxic to the bacteria. They used genetic and molecular biology techniques to identify genes and mechanisms that are involved in this adaptation process. The authors found that adaptation to bile salts involves changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of stress response genes. They also found that some mutations in genes involved in lipopolysaccharide metabolism confer increased resistance to bile salts. The authors provide a detailed description of the methods and techniques used in their study, as well as a discussion of the potential implications of their findings for understanding Salmonella pathogenesis and for developing strategies to control Salmonella infections. Overall, this study provides important new insights into the adaptation of Salmonella to bile salts and will be of interest to researchers working in the fields of microbiology, molecular biology, and food safety.
Here the authors present an investigation of the Mu prophage in Escherichia coli. They show that the ends of Mu are paired in the prophage and that this pairing is dependent on the gyrase binding site, a region of the genome that is important for Mu transposition. The authors also show that the transcription factor HU is important for the pairing of Mu ends. These results suggest that the pairing of Mu ends in the prophage may be important for the maintenance of the prophage in the bacterial genome.
A study was conducted in Papua New Guinea in 2009 to 2010 to investigate the impact of Primaquine (PQ) treatment on the development of gametocytes in children with Plasmodium vivax (Pv) infections. The study included 504 children aged 5 to 10 years, who were randomly assigned to receive either a blood-stage treatment plus PQ or a blood-stage treatment plus placebo. Blood samples were collected before treatment and at regular intervals after treatment. Gametocytes were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is a highly sensitive and specific method. The results showed that PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%. The study also found that children with Pv infections had higher gametocyte densities compared to those with Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) infections. The study concluded that PQ treatment was effective in reducing the incidence of Pv gametocytes, and that children with Pv infections had higher gametocyte densities compared to those with Pf infections.
The Rho family of GTPases is involved in regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton during cell migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. These GTPases are controlled by their spatial localization, nucleotide binding, and binding to Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI). GTPase cycling between membrane and cytosol is key to the differential upstream regulation of these biochemical switches. A modeling framework was developed to analyze experimental data for these systems. The analysis can reveal details of GTPase cycling and help distinguish between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In this study, the authors analyzed the membrane cycling of Rac, a member of the Rho family of GTPases. They found that the lower apparent affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacGDP can be fully explained by the faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. The authors then used this analysis to predict the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities between GTPases and membrane and/or GDI on the amount of membrane bound GTPase. This methodology can be used to assess how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios.
The paper is about the need for better monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of schistosomiasis treatment programs. The authors use a mathematical model to explore how different age-intensity profiles of schistosomiasis infection in adults can affect the recommended treatment coverage levels to achieve the World Health Organization (WHO) goals of morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem. The authors found that for moderate prevalence regions, regardless of the burden of infection in adults, treating school-aged children (SAC) only may achieve the WHO goals. However, for high prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adult treatment is required to meet the WHO goals. This highlights the importance of considering the burden of infection in adults when determining the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region. The authors also emphasize the need for more accurate and detailed data from M&E programs to accurately determine the optimal treatment strategy. They suggest the need for collecting prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age-range, specifically the inclusion of adult data at baseline (prior to treatment) and throughout the treatment programme if possible, rather than SAC only, to accurately determine the treatment strategy for a defined region. The authors also discuss the need for additional epidemiological data, such as individual longitudinal adherence to treatment, that should ideally be collected in M&E programs.
In this study, the authors use a mathematical model to simulate seizures in patients with left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE). The model is based on the concept of bistability, which describes a system that can switch between two stable states. The authors use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 22 patients with mTLE and 39 healthy controls to create a network of the patient's brain structure, and then use this network to run simulations of seizures. The authors compare the results of their simulations to clinical data on seizure frequency and localization, and to previous studies that have used the same bistability model. They find that the model is able to accurately simulate the characteristics of seizures in mTLE, and that the model predicts that surgery is likely to be more effective if it is performed according to a patient-specific plan that is based on the patient's individual brain structure, rather than following a predefined standard procedure.
The human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) causes Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a malignant tumor that primarily affects the skin of people with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). One of the critical factors regulating the replication of HHV-8 is the host immune response, which is suppressed during KS development. The host immune response involves interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1, a transcriptional regulator of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses. HHV-8 counteracts the IRF-1-mediated host immune response by producing four viral IRF (vIRF)-1 proteins, which inhibit IFN synthesis and signaling. In this study, the authors identify a novel mechanism of IRF-1 inhibition by HHV-8 through the direct interaction of vIRF-1 with BimEL, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. The authors demonstrate that this interaction leads to the nuclear sequestration of BimEL and thereby prevents its pro-apoptotic function. The authors also show that this interaction is important for HHV-8 replication and that it can be disrupted to enhance the host immune response to HHV-8. Overall, the findings of this study provide important insights into the mechanisms by which HHV-8 inhibits host immune responses and suggest that targeting the vIRF-1-BimEL interaction could be a promising approach for developing new therapies for KS and other HHV-8-associated diseases.
Integrins are proteins found on the surface of many cells that help them adhere to other cells or to extracellular matrix (ECM). One specific integrin called αVβ6 is found only on the surface of epithelial cells in the lung. This integrin plays an important role in the homeostasis (balanced state) of the lung. When the lung is injured, the balance is disturbed and the αVβ6 integrin is upregulated (made more). This upregulation helps the lung repair itself, but it also causes other problems. When mice lacking the β6 subunit of the αVβ6 integrin were infected with influenza, they had less severe disease and better survival rates. This is because the upregulation of the αVβ6 integrin was prevented, which helped reduce the inflammation and damage to the lungs. The β6-deficient mice also had more type I interferon signaling activity, which helped protect them from influenza. When exogenous TGF-β1 was added to the β6-deficient mice, their protection from influenza was lost. This suggests that αVβ6 integrin is involved in a communication system between lung epithelial cells and immune cells, and that this communication is necessary for the protective effects against influenza.
This study aimed to assess the usefulness of Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ACL) across different age groups in an endemic area. The study analyzed the clinical and diagnostic work-up of 733 cases with cutaneous and mucosal lesions who presented at a reference center in Argentina from 2006 to 2015. The results showed that LST was a useful diagnostic complement in ACL across all age groups, and its correlation with the smear was high. The study also identified that lesions older than 21 days were more likely to have positive results for both smear and LST than younger lesions. The study suggests that LST can be used as a diagnostic complement for ACL in all age groups, and its high correlation with smear makes it a reliable tool for use in clinical practice.
This study identifies a differentially expressed gene, PPAP2B, in human macrophages treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) that encodes a protein with a promoter region containing a CAD-associated variant (rs72664324) of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the CAD risk factor, APOE. The study shows that the rs72664324 variant is associated with increased expression of PPAP2B in human macrophages treated with oxLDL, and that this increased expression is due to enhancer activity at the promoter region of the gene. The study also shows that the rs72664324 variant is associated with a decreased risk of CAD in humans. The study provides evidence that the rs72664324 variant may exert its protective effect on CAD by reducing the production of oxidized LDL in the bloodstream.
In this study, the authors report the impact of a single round of mass antibiotic treatment on the prevalence of trachoma in 1-9-year-olds in eight districts of Malawi with a baseline prevalence of trachoma of 5-9.9%. The study found that one round of mass drug administration with ~80% coverage was associated with a reduction in TF prevalence to <5%. The authors suggest that this approach could be a viable option for eliminating trachoma in districts with prevalences of trachoma above 5%, as it avoids the need for time-consuming and resource-intensive surveys to determine the prevalence at a sub-district level.
I am an abstract from the following manuscript:  I am an abstract of the manuscript:  Brown, M., & Broderick, A. (2002). Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins in plants: A review. Annual Review of Plant Biology, 56, 231–256. doi:10.1146/annurev.plabio.56.1.231
In this study, a model was developed to forecast the prevalence of a parasitic disease called Schistosoma haematobium in the district of Niono, Mali, for various time horizons (1-6 months). The model was based on a framework called exponential smoothing (ES), which uses a combination of components that describe the observed data and their underlying pattern of seasonality. The model was optimized using a technique called maximum likelihood and a statistical measure called the Akaike Information Criterion. The model was applied to data from 1996 to 2004 and found to be accurate, with a low mean absolute percentage error and a moderate coefficient of variance. The model was also compared to other forecasting techniques and found to be superior in terms of accuracy and performance. The results of this study suggest that the ES model is a useful tool for forecasting the prevalence of S. haematobium in the district of Niono, Mali, and that it can be used to assist in the management of the disease.
Herpesviruses are able to replicate inside cells by taking over the cell cycle machinery. In order to do so, they use special proteins that bind and interact with the cell cycle proteins. One of these proteins is pp150, which binds to cyclin A and blocks the cell cycle at a certain point. This is necessary for the virus to replicate efficiently. However, other viral proteins are also involved in this process, and the combination of all these proteins determines how the virus will replicate. By using a cyclin A-binding deficient mutant of pp150, we showed that the restriction of viral gene expression in S/G2 phase is not essential for productive infection, but it does lead to a delay in the infection process. We also showed that the restriction is necessary for efficient replication.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes paralysis and death due to muscle weakness. It is caused by mutations in multiple genes. Several genes have been linked to ALS, and there are more than 100 known mutations in these genes that cause ALS. However, there are many genes that have not been linked to ALS, and it is possible that mutations in these genes cause the disease as well. Therefore, researchers are interested in identifying new genes that are associated with ALS. They are using a technique called next generation sequencing to look for genetic mutations in the exons (coding regions) of known and candidate genes in patients with ALS. They found that patients with ALS had more deleterious rare and novel mutations than controls. They also found that there were enrichments in mutations in genes containing RNA recognition motifs and known ALS genes. These findings suggest that mutations in previously unknown genes may cause ALS, and that there are likely many more genes that are involved in the disease.
In a study published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine in 2011, researchers discovered that the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key regulator of T cell memory to influenza virus, particularly in the development of CD4+ T cell memory. The researchers found that CD4+ T cell memory was critically dependent on IL-6, and that IL-6 limited the activity of virus-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs). They also found that influenza-induced IL-6 limited the activity of virus-specific Tregs, thereby facilitating the activity of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying T cell memory to influenza virus, and highlights the potential of targeting IL-6 to enhance vaccine efficacy.
This abstract is about a protein called enolase that is found in the ameba parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Enolase is a protein that is involved in energy metabolism, and it is found in many different types of cells. In this study, the authors use a technique called yeast two-hybrid analysis to determine if enolase interacts with another protein called Dnmt2. Dnmt2 is a protein that is involved in the process of DNA methylation, which is a way that cells control the activity of certain genes. The authors found that enolase does interact with Dnmt2, and they also used other techniques to confirm this interaction. The authors also found that the level of enolase expression in the ameba is affected by the availability of glucose, which is an important source of energy for these cells. This information could be useful for understanding how Entamoeba histolytica parasites use energy to carry out their functions, and for developing new ways to treat infections caused by these parasites.
The present study identified 103 microRNAs in Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus saliva . Seventy-two of the detected miRNAs were aligned with previously identified miRNAs while 31 were potential novel miRNAs. Additionally, 59 and 30 known miRNAs were upregulated in Ae . aegypti and Ae . albopictus CHIKV-infected saliva respectively. The study also demonstrated the functional importance of these miRNAs in CHIKV dissemination and transmission in the host.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is essential for cell survival and encodes 13 proteins, 2 rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs required for mitochondrial translation. Mutations in mtDNA are associated with a variety of human diseases, such as mitochondrial disorders, cancer, and neurological diseases. Since mtDNA is maternally inherited, mutations in mtDNA are transmitted from the mother to her offspring. Mutations in mtDNA are also associated with maternal effects in which the mother is asymptomatic, but her offspring develop mitochondrial diseases. To understand the mechanism of mtDNA inheritance and the role of mtDNA in mitochondrial diseases, researchers have used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. In yeast, mtDNA is also maternally inherited, and most of the mtDNA is located in the mitochondrial matrix. mtDNA encodes 13 proteins required for mitochondrial translation, which are responsible for the synthesis of mitochondrial proteins. Mitochondrial translation is a complex process that requires the coordination of ribosomes, transfer RNAs, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Mitochondrial translation is initiated by the binding of the mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit (mLSU) to the mitochondrial ribosomal small subunit (mSSU) at the mRNA start codon. The mSSU then transfers the initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA) to the start codon, which starts the elongation phase of mitochondrial translation. Elongation of mitochondrial translation is initiated by the binding of the mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mtARSs) to the corresponding transfer RNAs (mt-tRNAs). The mt-tRNAs are then charged with the appropriate amino acids and transferred to the mLSU to form peptide bonds. mtDNA mutations can lead to mitochondrial translation defects, resulting in mitochondrial diseases. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of mitochondrial translation is crucial for the development of therapeutic strategies for mitochondrial diseases.
This study aims to determine if there are associations between social determinants of health and Group A Streptococcus (GAS) infection, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD), and the effects of interventions targeting these factors. The study included 90 studies, 91 individual studies in total. The majority of studies assessed crowding, socioeconomic status, education, and employment of parents or cases, and nutrition. Crowding was the most assessed factor, followed by socioeconomic status. The majority of studies reported positive associations between these factors and the risk of GAS infection, ARF, or RHD. Crowding and socioeconomic status met the criteria for a causal association. However, the study found substantial heterogeneity across all key study aspects.
A single mutation in a bacterial signaling protein can cause a dramatic change in phenotype. We found that a mutation in the histidine kinase PhoQ in the PhoQ/PhoP system, which is a prototypical two-component signaling network, resulted in a bistable phenotype. The mutant cells were either in the on or off state, and the state of each cell was inherited over many generations. The bistable phenotype was due to a positive autoregulation of PhoP and PhoQ, which are the key proteins in the circuit. The mutation led to a loss of phosphatase activity in PhoQ, which is the bifunctional protein that phosphorylates and dephosphorylates PhoP. The mutant cells had different morphologies in the on and off states, and their state was determined by external conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type. Mathematical modeling and experiments showed that the bistable phenotype was due to the complex interactions of the signaling network. The mutation produced a dramatic change in phenotype, and the system became highly sensitive to small changes in external conditions.
This article provides a detailed description of the molecular characterization and inhibition of Naegleria fowleri, a free-living amoeba that causes the deadly disease Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM). The authors found that Naegleria fowleri is more closely related to fungi than to other amoebae, and that it shares a similar sterol biosynthesis pathway with fungi. They also found that the antifungal drug posaconazole, which is used to treat invasive aspergillosis and cryptococcosis, is effective against Naegleria fowleri in vitro and in vivo. The authors suggest that posaconazole could be considered as a potential treatment option for PAM.
In this study, the authors aimed to determine the role of IL-4Rα after polarization in the maintenance of anti-nematode type 2 immune responses. The authors used a recently developed strain of rosaCreERT2-/+IL-4Rα-/Lox mice, which allowed for the temporal control of il4rα gene deletion. The study found that sustained expression of IL-4Rα is required for the maintenance of type 2 immune responses and protective immunity following polarization with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N. brasiliensis) primary infection. Additionally, the study found that signaling via this receptor drives more efficient recall of type 2 immune responses and clearance of the parasites when temporal deletion of IL-4Rα was done prior to secondary infection with N. brasiliensis. Overall, the study suggests that IL-4Rα mediated signaling is required for the maintenance of anti-nematode type 2 immune responses, describing a novel function for IL-4Rα that is distinct from its role in immune polarization.
Bartonella are bacteria that are found in many animals and have the potential to cause human diseases such as cat scratch fever and trench fever. In this study, researchers analyzed patterns of Bartonella transmission and likely sources of spillover using the largest collection of Bartonella gltA genotypes assembled. The researchers found that rodents and domestic animals serve as the reservoirs or at least key proximate hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. They also found evidence of exchange of Bartonella between phylogenetically distant domestic animals and wildlife. The study suggests that care should be taken to avoid contact between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife to protect the health of all.
This study describes the role of MALAT1, a long noncoding RNA, in regulating cell cycle progression. The authors show that MALAT1 levels are regulated during the cell division cycle, and that depletion of MALAT1 induces DNA damage response and results in the activation of p53 and its target genes. The cell cycle defects observed in MALAT1-depleted cells are sensitive to the cellular levels of p53, indicating that p53 is an important effector of MALAT1 function. Finally, the authors establish that the pro-proliferative role of MALAT1 is accomplished by its involvement in regulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of oncogenic transcription factors, especially those that control mitotic progression.
This study investigates the role of JH in the regulation of DNA replication, polyploidy, and vitellogenesis in locusts. It shows that JH stimulates DNA replication through the activation of the Mcm4 and Mcm7 genes, which encode subunits of the mini-chromosome maintenance complex. These findings provide insights into the molecular basis of JH-dependent polyploidy and vitellogenesis in locusts and may have implications for our understanding of JH action in other insects.
Leprosy is a bacterial disease that causes nerve damage and deformities if left untreated. Prednisolone, an anti-inflammatory medicine, is often used to treat nerve damage caused by leprosy. However, the optimal treatment duration of prednisolone is unknown. In this study, researchers compared the effects of a 20-week treatment with a 32-week treatment of prednisolone on nerve damage in leprosy patients. They included 868 patients in their study and found that both 20-week and 32-week treatments had similar effects in improving and restoring nerve damage. Therefore, the researchers concluded that 20 weeks of prednisolone treatment is as effective as 32 weeks in improving nerve damage caused by leprosy. This finding is important because it will help doctors make better decisions about how long prednisolone treatment should be given to leprosy patients with nerve damage.
Scientists have developed a computer model to help understand how different sounds are produced by two species of deer, Rocky Mountain elk and European red deer. The model uses information about the anatomy and physiology of the larynx and vocal tract to simulate the sounds produced by these animals. The results of the model suggest that the low-frequency calls produced by red deer provide information about the size of the animal, while the high-frequency whistle-like bugles produced by elk may signal muscular strength and endurance. The model can also be used to study the relationship between the complexity of the sound and the anatomy and physiology of the animal producing it.
ChIP-seq is a widely used technique for studying the binding of transcription factors to DNA. However, it has been difficult to analyze regions where multiple reads map to the same genomic location, which can lead to inaccurate identification of peaks. In this study, we developed a method for incorporating multi-reads into the analysis of ChIP-seq data by using a weighted alignment approach to assign probabilities to each possible alignment. We applied this method to two ChIP-seq datasets: STAT1 in human HeLa S3 cells and GATA1 in mouse G1E-ER4 cells. We found that incorporating multi-reads led to an increase of up to 25% in the sequencing depth and the identification of high quality novel peaks. We also found that many of the novel peaks were located in close proximity to promoters and within segmental duplications of the genomes. We validated our computational results by experimental validation of a subset of GATA1 peaks that were only identifiable when multi-reads were incorporated.
This paper provides a summary of a study on the economic impact of the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The study estimates the economic benefit of achieving the goals of the London Declaration, based on the assumption that NTDs will be eliminated by 2030. The authors used a combination of country-specific information and data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study to estimate the economic impact of eliminating NTDs. The study found that the economic benefit of achieving the goals of the London Declaration would be substantial, with an estimated net return on investment (ROI) of $6.1 trillion (2030). The authors also estimated the economic impact of achieving the goals of the SDGs on UHC and financial risk protection by 2030, which would result in an additional net ROI of $6.8 trillion. The authors suggest that the economic benefits of achieving the goals of the London Declaration and SDGs on UHC and financial risk protection would justify continued investment in NTD control and elimination efforts.
This paper presents a detailed analysis of the neural responses of marmosets to pure tones with different frequencies and durations. The neural responses were recorded from a large population of neurons in the primary auditory cortex of the marmoset, and the information content of these responses was quantified and compared between different conditions. The results showed that neural responses in the onset epoch of sound presentation were selective and had high information content, while neural responses in the sustained epoch were less selective and had lower information content. The authors also used a statistical decoding approach to show that the information content of the neural responses in the onset epoch was sufficient to decode the sound identity and frequency. They also presented a detailed analysis of the decoding accuracy of the neural responses in the sustained epoch, which showed that the decoding accuracy was lower compared to the onset epoch. The authors also compared the decoding accuracy of neural responses in the sustained epoch with a Poisson model, which showed that the decoding accuracy of the neural responses was significantly better than a Poisson model. Finally, the authors used a dynamical systems approach to analyze the population neural response trajectories and show that the information content of the neural responses was encoded in a low-dimensional subspace.
The study suggests that the co-stimulatory molecule OX40 is essential for the long-term survival of T cells during chronic viral infections. Mice infected with LCMV clone 13 were shown to develop a strong CD4 and CD8 T cell response, including T cell dependent antibody responses. However, OX40-deficient mice were unable to maintain these responses over time, leading to a failure to control viral replication. The study highlights the importance of OX40 in maintaining T cell responses during chronic viral infections.
Scientists have found that eight different aquatic animals have evolved to swim with elongated fins in a similar way, despite the fact that they have no common ancestor that swam in this way. The scientists found that these animals, which include both vertebrates and invertebrates, all have a specific wavelength in their fin undulations that is about 20 times the mean amplitude of their movements. This finding suggests that there is an optimal way for aquatic animals to swim using elongated fins, and that this method has evolved independently in multiple different species. The scientists used numerical simulations and experiments with a robot to study the kinematics and propulsive force generated by these undulations. They found that the specific wavelength that is observed across the diverse set of animals is associated with a maximum in the force generated by the undulations, and that this force is sufficient to generate the observed swimming speeds. The scientists hypothesize that the optimal specific wavelength is the result of evolutionary selection pressures favoring efficient swimming.
The study examined the role of condensin I and II in neuronal stem cell (NSC) divisions during cortical development. NSCs were cultured in vitro, and their mitotic spindles were observed by confocal microscopy. It was found that condensin I and II were both essential for mitotic spindle formation and orientation. Condensin I was also required for proper chromosome segregation, whereas condensin II was required for faithful DNA replication. Loss of either condensin led to DNA damage and p53 activation, eventually resulting in apoptosis. Simultaneous depletion of both condensins caused a more severe set of defective phenotypes, indicating that the two condensins have non-overlapping functions. Remarkably, however, it was found that pericentromeric heterochromatin regions formed abnormally large clusters in condensin II-depleted NSCs and postmitotic neurons. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that condensins I and II are essential for NSC divisions during cortical development, and that they have distinct but complementary functions.
In this paper, the authors present a comprehensive study of the sex-biased genes expressed by the schistosomula and adult worms of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. They used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed between males and females in each developmental stage, and to investigate the epigenetic differences between the sexes. The study revealed a number of sex-biased genes that are differentially expressed between males and females in the different developmental stages of S. mansoni, and it identified specific genes that may play a role in the sexual dimorphism of the parasite. The authors also analyzed the epigenetic differences between the sexes and identified sex-specific chromatin structure that may be involved in the regulation of sex-biased genes. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sexual dimorphism in S. mansoni, and it may have important implications for the development of new therapeutic targets for schistosomiasis.
This study proposes a new approach to modeling disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts. The approach allows for computing the confidence value (i.e., the posterior probability that it is correct) for each individual annotation, given annotator-specific parameters estimated from data. The authors developed two probabilistic models for this analysis, compared these models using computer simulation, and tested their actual performance based on a large data set generated by human annotators specifically for this study. They show that even in the worst-case scenario, when all annotators disagree, their approach allows them to significantly increase the probability of choosing the correct annotation. The proposed models can be applied to most data annotation studies and can help improve the quality and reliability of the data collected.
The DNA vaccine/goose platform is used to produce neutralizing antibodies against ANDV that can prevent lethal HPS in the hamster model. The neutralizing titers of α-ANDV IgY/IgYΔFc purified from egg yolks of DNA vaccinated geese were determined after initial and long-term booster vaccinations. The neutralizing titers were further increased after long-range booster vaccination. Polyclonal neutralizing antibodies produced using the DNA vaccine/goose platform administered post-exposure are capable of preventing disease in the ANDV/Syrian hamster model of lethal HPS.
In this study, the authors used a mouse model for lung cancer to investigate how the enzyme Dnmt3a impacts the methylation patterns of cancer cells. They used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to analyze the methylomes of Dnmt3a-deficient lung tumors and compared them to the methylomes of Dnmt3a-wildtype lung tumors. Their results showed that Dnmt3a deficiency led to a loss of methylation in large active chromatin domains in the genome. They also found that Dnmt3a is required for efficient maintenance methylation of active chromosome domains and that Dnmt3a-deficient tumors showed moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. Overall, their findings uncover a novel function of Dnmt3a in cancer and provide new insights into the role of this enzyme in the methylation patterns of cancer cells.
The study investigates the spatiotemporal organization of the microcircuit in the avian song motor cortex. The authors recorded calcium and spike activity from song motor neurons in singing zebra finches and found that the activity patterns of two cell types, excitatory and inhibitory neurons, are spatially clustered and phase-locked to a local 30 Hz rhythm. These findings provide new insights into the organization of the song motor microcircuit and its role in generating and coordinating the complex sequence of vocal motor actions in songbirds.
The authors report a large-scale RNAi screen in which they identified 64 genes that, when knocked down in adult worms, extend lifespan. These genes are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including metabolism, reproduction, and stress resistance, which have been shown to regulate lifespan in other organisms. The authors also provide detailed information on the specific phenotypes associated with each gene knockdown and discuss potential mechanisms for their effects on lifespan.
In this paper, the authors performed a forward genetic screen to identify genes that are important for zebrafish fin regeneration. They found that a mutation in the lamb1a gene blocks fin regeneration. The authors used positional cloning and complementation assays to determine that lamb1a is a temperature-sensitive allele that is specifically required for fin regeneration. They also found that lamb1a is not required for other developmental processes, such as juvenile body growth, homeostatic maintenance of adult tissue, or repair of split fins. The authors determined that lamb1a function is dispensable for bone regeneration, but they found that it is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial cell layer. This basal epithelial cell layer is important for expression of growth factors and patterning of new osteoblasts. The authors also found that fgf20a mutations and transgenic Fgf receptor inhibition disrupt lamb1a expression. They concluded that a critical step in formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis is induced expression of lamb1a in the basal layer of the wound epithelium. This step is guided by early expression of growth factors.
This article compares the performance of several linear mixed model (LMM) methods for analyzing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Linear mixed models are commonly used to analyze GWAS data because they account for correlation between individuals due to genetic relatedness. However, there are many different LMM methods available, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. In this article, the authors compare the performance of several different LMM methods using both real and simulated data. They find that the method used by the program MMM (Merlin Mixed Models for Genetic Analysis) generally performs well across a range of scenarios, but that the performance of other methods can vary depending on the specific scenario. They also find that some methods are more computationally efficient than others, which can be an important consideration for large-scale GWAS analyses. Overall, the article provides a useful overview of the different LMM methods that are available for GWAS analyses and helps researchers to choose the most appropriate method for their specific data and analysis.

The content of this paper describes a novel diagnostic approach for the detection of filarial parasites, such as Brugia malayi, in mosquitoes. The approach involves a rapid, portable, and battery-powered PCR platform, coupled with a test strip-based DNA detection assay. The authors compare the performance of this novel approach with standard silica column-based DNA extraction techniques and demonstrate that the rapid NaOH-based methodology provides sensitive and genus-specific detection of parasite DNA from extracted mosquito pools. The authors also demonstrate that the miniaturized PCR platform is capable of field-ready use, eliminating the reliance on expensive and bulky instrumentation. The authors suggest that this field-ready diagnostic system should increase the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring within B. malayi-endemic locations and provide the proof-of-concept framework for the development of a parallel assay for the detection of W. bancrofti. The study provides a promising solution for the challenges faced by laboratories in many endemic areas, where there exists a need for inexpensive, equipment-minimizing diagnostic options that can be transported to the field and implemented in minimal resource settings.
The current study represents a first step in modeling the self-assembly of elastomeric proteins at the molecular level, by utilizing the diffusion limited aggregation algorithm. The influence of the architecture of elastomeric proteins on the morphology and stability of the assembled polymer was investigated. The study provides insights into the molecular basis for the evolution of elastomeric proteins and helps guide the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides.
This paper describes the regulation of translation by the 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs) of the seven viral genes in Ebola virus (EBOV). EBOV has a long 5′-UTR that is important for viral replication. The study found that mutating the uORFs in the 5′-UTRs of the seven viral genes in EBOV enhanced translation at the corresponding pORF. This effect was most pronounced in the case of the L gene, where the L uORF could potently suppress pORF translation, but in response to eIF2α phosphorylation, the L uORF maintained L translation. The data suggest that a uORF in the EBOV L mRNA regulates polymerase expression in response to the status of the cellular innate immune response and is required for optimal virus replication.
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are essential for genome stability and play a key role in various biological processes, including chromosome segregation, meiosis, and repair of damaged DNA. However, these breaks can also lead to the development of cancer, as they can cause mutations, deletions, and amplifications in genes. Previous studies have identified human fragile sites, which are prone to damage under replication stress and are associated with genomic instability. These fragile sites are often characterized by a lack of replication origins and the presence of repetitive DNA sequences, which can hinder replication forks and increase the risk of DSBs. To study the distribution of DSBs in the human genome, the authors developed a method for precise genome-wide mapping of blunt-ended DSBs in human chromosomes. They observed non-random fragmentation and DSB hot spots and found that about 30% of these hot spots delimit protected DNA domains. The authors also found that these domains contain coordinately expressed genes and that PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 specifically bind DNA sequences at the domain termini. This suggests a novel type of gene regulation: a coordinated transcription or silencing of gene clusters delimited by DSB hot spots and PARP1 and HNRNPa2B1 binding sites. The authors' data suggest that unknown chromosomal regulatory mechanisms may be involved in replication, transcription, and DSB formation in various normal cell types. These mechanisms could be affected and responsible for the massive genomic rearrangements seen in cancer cells. The study provides important new insights into the mechanisms of genomic instability and has implications for the development of new cancer therapies that target these mechanisms.
In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the diversity of trypanosomatids that circulate in bats from two areas in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They found that the diversity of trypanosomatids in this area of the Atlantic Forest is great and is able to maintain trypanosomatid diversity. The results of this study are significant because it contributes to the understanding of the distribution of trypanosomatids in bats in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro and shows that this area plays a vital role in the maintenance of trypanosomatid diversity in this environment.
This study investigated the prevalence of known and neglected tick-borne pathogens in adult female Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in the French Ardennes. The study used a novel high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR method to identify up to 37 different species of bacteria and parasites, including seven species belonging to the Lyme disease spirochete group, five species of Anaplasma, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Ehrlichia ruminantium, E. canis, E. chaffeensis, ten species of Babesia, two species of Theileria, and TBEV. The study found that co-infections were common, and that there were significant interactions between some pathogens. The findings highlight the potential consequences of tick co-infections on public health.
This study creates a model that simulates the genetic switches that determine whether stem cells will develop into erythrocytes or neutrophils. The model explains how the switches are primed to make a decision and how they can be reprogrammed to make a different choice. The model can help scientists better understand the genetic mechanisms that control stem cell differentiation and how these mechanisms can be controlled and manipulated.
In this study, the authors used transposon mutagenesis to identify additional genes involved in the resistance of Enterococcus faecalis to the effectors of the innate immune system. They found that several genes that contribute to the decoration of the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen play an essential role in resistance to effectors of the innate immune system and in virulence. The authors also used complementation experiments to confirm the role of these genes. Their findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of resistance of E. faecalis to the effectors of the innate immune system and the role of the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen in virulence.
This study presents RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation), a novel two-stage regression framework that integrates gene expression, DNA methylation, and copy number variation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and transcription factor (TF) binding data from the ENCODE project. The first stage of RACER infers sample-specific TF activities using ENCODE TF binding data derived from a generic cell-line, and the second stage uses the estimated regulatory activities to infer miRNA/TF-gene regulatory relationships across samples. The proposed model demonstrates superior statistical power in detecting known TF/miRNA-gene interactions compared to existing methods using alternative input features. Feature selection was performed to identify 18 prominent regulators, whose activities consistently clustered based on cytogenetic risk groups. The study further proposes a novel role of a recently identified miRNA hsa-miR-548p in AML pathogenesis because of its significant target gene enrichments for leukemia-related pathway and its inferred interaction with another prominent feature regulator YY1, whose perturbed expression has been implicated in AML development. Moreover, the study identifies a potential prognostic marker using the inferred activities of C-Fos, which has been previously shown to have oncogenic activity and is frequently overexpressed in tumour cells. The study concludes that RACER successfully integrated the TCGA and ENCODE data in revealing AML-specific regulatory program at the global level.
This study characterizes a novel dsRNA virus (ChNRV1) from the mycelium of Colletotrichum higginsianum, an important plant pathogen. ChNRV1 encodes two viral proteins that are homologous to the small (VP1) and large (VP2) coat proteins of the L-A viruses. ChNRV1 is genetically distinct from known L-A viruses, including the C. higginsianum-associated L-A virus (CHLV), and does not co-infect with CHLV. ChNRV1 infection results in growth reduction and severe fungal cell wall abnormalities in the host fungus. Small RNA analysis indicates that the host fungus responds to ChNRV1 infection with the production of a significant number of viral siRNAs. These siRNAs are generated by RNAi pathways and act by promoting host gene silencing. The study also characterizes the host response to ChNRV1 infection at the transcriptome level, revealing significant changes in gene expression related to DNA replication, cell wall biogenesis, and secondary metabolism. These data suggest that ChNRV1 is a novel dsRNA virus that has a significant impact on its host fungus.
Mof is a major HAT for histone H4 lysine 16 ( H4K16 ) in somatic cells. We show that MOF is involved in the expansion of chromatin-wide H2AX phosphorylation in leptonema and zygonema. MDC1 recruitment and MSCI are also disturbed in Mof deleted pachytene spermatocytes, with absence of XY-H2AX phosphorylation expansion, which may partly contribute to the germ cell loss observed in Mof cKO mice. RAD51 foci persist in Mof cKO spermatocytes until diplonema and are associated with a significant reduction in crossover markers and chiasma formation. Together, these data indicate that the expansion of different waves of H2AX phosphorylation, efficient DSB repair, and the formation of crossovers during male meiosis are affected by MOF, thus highlighting novel roles for this protein.
The study investigates the effects of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) infection on human thymopoiesis in the "Human Immune System" (HIS) mouse model. The authors found that HTLV-1 infection led to increased numbers of single-positive CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen of HIS mice, as well as increased expression of NF-κB-dependent genes such as CD25 and Bfl-1 in thymocytes. Additionally, the authors found that abnormalities such as hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and lymphoma were present in HTLV-1-infected HIS mice, several months after infection. These findings suggest that HTLV-1 infection may be a prerequisite for the malignant lymphoproliferation associated with this retroviral infection.
Schistosomiasis is a waterborne disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide. It is caused by parasitic worms that live in the intestines or blood vessels of their hosts. These parasites can cause a range of health problems, including anemia, liver damage, and fertility problems. The project described in this article is aimed at controlling schistosomiasis in a locality of White Nile State, Sudan. The project involves a number of different activities, including: baseline and follow-up parasitological examination of urine and feces to determine the prevalence of S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections in students and villagers, health education to increase awareness of schistosomiasis and its prevention among students and villagers, and the construction and maintenance of a drinking water filtration system. The results of the project will be used to inform future schistosomiasis control programs in Sudan.
The aim of this study is to characterize the trafficking of NiV-M within the cell and determine its role in NiV assembly and budding. We found that NiV-M translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during infection. The nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M is regulated by a putative bipartite NLS, a leucine-rich NES, and a conserved lysine residue in the NLS. The nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M is essential for viral budding, and NiV-M's nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking is regulated by a putative bipartite NLS, a leucine-rich NES, and a conserved lysine residue in the NLS. The nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of NiV-M is essential for viral budding, and NiV-M's nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking is regulated by a putative bipartite NLS, a leucine-rich NES, and a conserved lysine residue in the NLS.
The PV entry pathway has been identified using live-cell imaging of infectious dual-labeled PV. The PV RNA release was a rapid and efficient process that did not limit the specific infectivity of the virus. Entry was actin-dependent and involved clathrin-independent endocytosis. The genome release took place only after endocytosis, within 100–200 nm of the plasma membrane. The biochemical assay and visualization assay demonstrated that PV RNA release was energy- and tyrosine kinase-dependent but did not require clathrin, caveolin, flotillin, or microtubules.
This article discusses the health education strategies and programs implemented for dengue fever (DF) prevention and control in Cambodia. The article describes the existing dengue situation in the country, the NDCP strategies for dengue prevention and control, and the effectiveness of community health education in promoting dengue prevention and control. The article also highlights the challenges in implementing effective community health education programs, including financial constraints, limited technical and logistical support, and poor integration with other health education activities. The article concludes that there is a need for improved and more effective community health education programs to ensure the effective prevention and control of DF in Cambodia.
In this study, researchers investigated the possibility of detecting parasite-derived microRNAs (miRNAs) in the blood of dogs and humans infected with filarial nematodes. They used deep sequencing and bioinformatics analysis to identify potential miRNA candidates in the plasma of dogs infected with Dirofilaria immitis and Brugia pahangi, and in the serum of Onchocerca volvulus-infected humans. They then used stem-loop reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to confirm the presence of selected miRNA candidates in the plasma of infected dogs. Their findings suggest that parasite-derived miRNAs could potentially be used as biomarkers for the detection of filarial infections in both dogs and humans.
The present study presents a detailed investigation into the conformational changes of the catalytic domain of Src kinase using a combination of coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis. The study is based on a simplified structure-based multi-state model, which allows the dynamics of switching between the inactive and active states of the catalytic domain to be simulated. The two-state Gō-like model, which includes both the inactive and active states, is extended to allow for the switching process to occur. The resulting multi-state model is implemented in the molecular dynamics package CHARMM, and Langevin dynamics simulations are carried out to generate trajectories that capture the conformational changes of the catalytic domain over a timescale of µsec. The trajectories are clustered into N distinct states, and a structural network is constructed from the simulation snapshots. The transition probability matrix T ( t ) is calculated, and a Markov model is constructed to describe the kinetics of the conformational change process. The results of the study provide insights into the mechanism of conformational activation in the catalytic domain of Src kinase and the dynamics of the two alternative pathways.
We show that natural variation in the frequency of cellularization in the endosperm is correlated with genotypes at the TTG2 locus. We find that the ttg2 loss-of-function mutant has a cellularization frequency similar to that of the Ler parent, whereas the Col parent has a higher frequency of cellularization. We show that TTG2 maps to the region of natural variation, and that epistasis occurs between TTG2 and STAIRS. We also show that F1 seed development is affected by the maternal genotype, and that this can be explained by the action of TTG2. Our results suggest that TTG2 acts on maternal transcription factors to control cellularization. We also show that TTG2 has a role in seed growth, and that this may be linked to the action of TTG2 on maternal transcription factors.
In this study, the authors conducted a comparative analysis of host-pathogen co-evolution in bats and rodents using two bacterial pathogens as case studies. They compiled available genetic information on bats and rodents hosts and Bartonella and Leptospira pathogens, and used maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods to determine phylogenies. They found that bats and rodents hosts were more closely related to their associated pathogens than expected by chance. They also found that Leptospira exhibited a higher degree of host specificity compared to Bartonella. They further examined the global patterns of host-pathogen co-evolution and found evidence of cospeciation, host switching, and host extinction events in both bats and rodents. Overall, their findings suggest that host-pathogen co-evolution can provide insights into the ecological relationships and evolutionary history of mammalian hosts and their associated bacterial pathogens.
In this work, we use a chain-link model of undulatory swimming to study how body deformations arise in response to forcing. The chain-link model can be solved using the forced damped oscillator (FDO) theory, which is a general approach to study the dynamics of complex systems. We will show that body deformation kinematics arise as a result of the interaction of two types of forces - muscle forces and the forces due to the interaction with the fluid. We will also show that the FDO model is able to capture the emergence of the deformation and movement of the body in response to forcing. We will compare the FDO model with the nonlinear resistive chain-link PM model (NRCPM) and the resistive IB (RIB) model.
The human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei (T . b . rhodesiense) can become infectious to humans by transferring genetic material from animal pathogen T . b . brucei during sexual reproduction. The Serum Resistance Associated (SRA) gene is the key genetic marker for identifying the human pathogen T . b . rhodesiense, and it exists as a single copy in a representative collection of T . b . rhodesiense strains. SRA can be found on either homologue of chromosome IV, but some Ugandan T . b . rhodesiense isolates have SRA on both homologues. Genetic exchange between T . b . rhodesiense and T . b . brucei occurs in the insect vector, the tsetse fly, and it has the hallmarks of conventional eukaryote sexual reproduction. Hybrid progeny from crosses between T . b . rhodesiense and T . b . brucei were previously analysed by testing resistance to lysis by human serum, but this is not such a reliable test for human infectivity as presence of the SRA gene. Using molecular techniques, we now provide the definitive experimental proof that SRA is readily transferred between T . b . rhodesiense and T . b . brucei during sexual reproduction, creating new genotypes of the human pathogen T . b . rhodesiense. The SRA gene is now in a new genetic background consisting of an equal mixture of the parental T . b . rhodesiense and T . b . brucei genomes. This has important implications for the epidemiology of HAT in East Africa.
The pancreas has specialized cells called beta-cells that release insulin into the bloodstream in response to high levels of glucose. Insulin helps cells in the body absorb glucose, which can help manage blood sugar levels. However, sometimes beta-cells don't work properly, which can cause diabetes. In this study, researchers created a mathematical model of the electrical activity and insulin secretion in beta-cells. They then compared the model to experimental data from real beta-cells to see how well it worked. The researchers found that the model accurately described the behavior of beta-cells under normal conditions. They also found that changes in the electrical connections between beta-cells could affect how well the cells worked together and how much insulin they released. The researchers used their model to help explain why certain genetic mutations can cause diabetes in humans. Overall, this study provides a useful tool for understanding the complex ways that beta-cells work together to regulate blood sugar levels.
The article presents a new model for predicting the dynamic behavior of gene transcription networks. The model takes into account retroactivity, a phenomenon where the dynamics of a module are influenced by the loading of the network. The authors establish an analysis framework for gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity. They propose a set of matrices to encode the key properties of a module and analyze how retroactivity affects the behavior of recurrent network motifs, such as negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, toggle switch, and single-input motif. The authors also present a quantitative metric that determines how robust the dynamic behavior of a module is to interconnection with other modules. Their work provides important insights into the design of synthetic biology systems and can be used to predict the behavior of natural networks.
The paper presents a fine-scale genetic map of the pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) of the human X chromosome based on African-American pedigrees. The genetic map is constructed using markers that are polymorphic in the human population and are present in both males and females. The genetic map reveals that there are two hotspots for recombination in the region, one of which is located within the SHOX gene. The paper also discusses the utility of the genetic map in understanding the recombination process in PAR1 and the role of PRDM9 in mediating recombination in the region. Finally, the paper provides an analysis of the evolution of recombination in PAR1 using biases in the allele frequency spectra for different types of mutations due to recombination.
This study shows that JMJD2A, a histone demethylase, is crucial for muscle differentiation. JMJD2A is upregulated during the differentiation process, and its deletion leads to inhibition of muscle-specific gene expression. The authors also demonstrate that JMJD2A directly binds to the Myog promoter, regulating H3K9 methylation. This regulation is essential for transcriptional activation of the Myog gene and initiation of muscle-specific gene expression.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is a global initiative that aims to eliminate the disease guinea worm disease (GWD) by 2020. The GWEP is focused on eliminating GWD in 3 countries: Chad, Ethiopia, and Mali. The GWEP has been ongoing since 1986 and has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cases of GWD. The GWEP has been successful due to the implementation of several strategies, including community-based education, filtration of all drinking water through cloth filters, and treatment of contaminated stagnant water sources with ABATE larvicide. Despite the success of the GWEP, there are still challenges that need to be addressed in order to eliminate GWD. These challenges include the need for continued surveillance and the potential for re-introduction of the disease.
The authors present a structural and functional analysis of a fragment of the Borrelia burgdorferi protein BBK32, which is responsible for inhibiting complement activity. They used X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of a 206–348 amino acid fragment of BBK32, which is referred to as BBK32-C. They found that BBK32-C has a unique structure that resembles a mixed β/α domain. They also showed that BBK32-C inhibits complement activity by interacting with the C3 convertase, C4b2a. They used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy to study the interaction between BBK32-C and C3b, and found that it binds to C3b with high affinity. They also showed that BBK32-C can inhibit the activity of the C3 convertase, C4b2a, in the presence of C3b, and that it can inhibit complement-mediated hemolysis. Finally, they used Far Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR to investigate the expression of BBK32-C in different B. burgdorferi strains, and found that BBK32-C is expressed by all strains tested.
This article is about the use of phosphorylation to control the switch from yeast to hyphal form in the fungus Candida albicans. The authors use a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques to identify the target proteins of the Cdc28 and Cbk1 kinases, which are involved in this switch. They show that the forkhead transcription factor Fkh2 is phosphorylated by both kinases in a coordinated manner, which activates it to promote the expression of hyphal-specific genes. The authors also show that the Pob3 scaffolding protein interacts with Fkh2, suggesting that it plays a role in the regulation of Fkh2 activity.
In this study, we characterized the cellular functions of two alternative routes to TdR for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis in T. brucei. We showed that both routes were essential for T. brucei cell growth and survival. We identified a novel 5'-nucleotidase in T. brucei and showed that this enzyme was required for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. Our study provided insights into the metabolism of nucleotides in T. brucei and the mechanisms of regulation of TdR for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. These findings may have implications for the development of new therapeutic approaches against T. brucei.
The authors have used a large database of bacterial and plastid genomes to investigate how protein translation initiates in the absence of a consensus sequence known as the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence. They found that an SD-like sequence is present upstream of the start codon in the majority of genes, but that there are many genes that lack an SD-like sequence. The authors then used bioinformatics techniques to search for alternative sequence motifs or RNA structural requirements that could promote start codon recognition in the absence of an SD-like sequence. They found that start codon recognition in the absence of an SD-like sequence is primarily driven by the accessibility of the start codon to the ribosome, with no significant alternative sequence motifs or RNA structural requirements. The authors then validated their findings using reporter gene constructs in E. coli, showing that local RNA unfoldedness is necessary and sufficient for initiation of protein biosynthesis in the absence of an SD-like sequence. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the initiation of protein translation in bacteria and plastids.
Post-Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) occurs in about 10% of people who receive treatment for a serious disease called visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in India. It is a skin condition that can occur after treatment for VL and can last up to 2 years. PKDL is rare in people who receive liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) for VL, which is why it is important to monitor them for it. In this study, we looked at the characteristics of people who were treated for VL in Bihar, India, with 20 mg/kg of Ambisome as first-line therapy between July 2007 and August 2012. Of the 8311 people treated for their first episode of VL, 24 (0.3%) returned to the program with symptoms that were later confirmed as PKDL. The majority of these people (89%) had a macular lesion (a flat or irregularly shaped blemish with a smooth surface) on their skin. The median (midpoint) time to develop PKDL after treatment with Ambisome was 1.2 years (0.8-2.2 years), which is shorter than the time it took for people who had been treated with sodium stibogluconate for VL and later developed PKDL. We found that there were no significant risk factors for PKDL in this study. However, we did find that the time to develop PKDL after treatment with Ambisome was shorter than after conventional VL treatments. We hope this information will be helpful for doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals who work with people who have VL and PKDL.
Triatoma infestans is a vector of Chagas disease, transmitted through the feces of infected bugs. In this study, we use longitudinal survey data on the abundance of infestation of T. infestans in two Argentinian villages to understand how the infestation levels change over time. We fit several competing models to the data, considering different ways of defining the source of dispersers, how the effect of insecticide spraying changes over time, and how the effect of previous infestation on establishment changes over time. We find that bug establishment is more likely in May, when temperatures are lower, and that dispersal distance has a strong effect on bug establishment. We find that bug establishment is less likely on sites that were previously sprayed or infested, and that the effect of previous infestation decreases over time. Our results suggest that to control T. infestans infestation, it may be necessary to focus on bug control in sites that were previously infested, but also to consider the effect of insecticide spraying on subsequent establishment.
Pathogenesis and Viral Load of SV40 in Syrian Hamsters. We examined the pathogenesis and viral load of SV40 in Syrian hamsters to better understand the role of this virus in human disease. Using a mouse-hamster chimeric model, we found that SV40 is capable of causing tumors and persistent infection in Syrian hamsters. We also found that different SV40 strains have different patterns of infection and tumor induction in hamsters. Our study provides valuable information on the pathogenesis of SV40 in vivo and has implications for the potential of this virus to cause human disease.
The article describes the identification of positive selection in the mammalian lineage using a large dataset of whole-genome alignments for eight species. The dataset includes six primates (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, and bonobo) and two rodents (mouse and rat). The authors identify 544 candidate genes with evidence of positive selection using a likelihood-based approach that incorporates a switching model of selective pressure. The authors also describe a Bayesian analysis that identifies 511 candidate genes that have evidence of positive selection at some point in their evolutionary history. The authors provide a list of candidate genes with evidence of positive selection and discuss the biological functions of these genes. The article also includes a discussion of the evolutionary dynamics of positive selection in the mammalian lineage, including the identification of genes that have evidence of positive selection in both humans and non-human mammals, as well as genes that have evidence of positive selection in only humans or non-human mammals. Overall, the article provides a comprehensive analysis of positive selection in the mammalian lineage and identifies several candidate genes with evidence of positive selection.
In this study, the authors describe the discovery of a new type of extracellular fibril that is produced by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. These fibrils are composed of small peptides called PSMs and are important for the biofilm disassembly activity of these peptides. The authors demonstrate that the aggregation of PSM peptides into amyloid-like fibers can modulate their biofilm disassembly activity. This discovery has important implications for the development of new approaches for treating persistent biofilm associated infections.
Chagas disease is a rare parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. It is transmitted mainly through the bite of infected insects but can also occur through blood transfusions, congenitally, or by oral route. The disease can remain asymptomatic for a long time, but it can eventually progress to cardiac and digestive symptoms, which require complex clinical management and specific treatments. Benznidazole (BZN) is one of the two drugs currently available to treat Chagas disease. It has been shown to be successful in the acute phase and congenital infections but only moderately effective in the chronic phase. Monitoring the success of treatment is challenging because the current gold standard, serology, can take up to twenty years to reach full "sero-reversion" and parasitological clearance by PCR is not always reliable. Therefore, a new surrogate biomarker that could be sensitive and specific for monitoring parasite persistence regardless of PCR results is needed. In this study, a new antibody profile assay was developed using fifteen T. cruzi antigens. The assay was tested on a large cohort of Chagas patients, and the results showed that a specific antibody response, Ab3, was strongly correlated with T. cruzi parasite persistence. Ab3 was found to be high and sustained in untreated patients and significantly declined in BZN-treated patients who cleared parasitemia based on PCR results. The study suggested that Ab3 could be a new surrogate biomarker for monitoring parasite persistence in Chagas disease patients.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes acute and chronic joint pain in humans. This study examines the pathology of CHIKV infection in mice by using a viral strain that causes human-like joint pain in mice. The study found that CHIKV infection causes acute joint pain in mice and that the pain persists for several weeks after infection. The study also found that the virus targets chondrocytes, which are the cells responsible for producing cartilage, in the joints of infected mice. The study suggests that CHIKV infection may cause chronic joint pain in humans by targeting chondrocytes.
Dimensionality reduction techniques are used to analyze the complex neural activity recorded in various brain regions. The goal is to understand how the number of dimensions in the neural activity co-vary with the number of neurons and trials recorded. Two key metrics were used, dshared and percent shared variance, which were derived from factor analysis (FA) that decomposed spike count covariance into a shared component and an independent component. The authors found that the shared component of the neural activity was related to the complexity of the network, while the independent component was related to the variability of the neural activity. They also found that dshared increased with increasing numbers of neurons, while percent shared variance decreased with increasing numbers of neurons. Additionally, the authors found that, in a spiking network model with clustered connection probabilities, dshared and percent shared variance were similar to those in in vivo recordings, while in a spiking network model with non-clustered connection probabilities, dshared and percent shared variance were smaller than those in in vivo recordings. These findings suggest that the dimensionality reduction techniques used in this study are useful for understanding the complexity and variability of neural activity in brain regions.
Quorum sensing (QS) is a mechanism that bacteria use to regulate gene expression in response to the population density. In recent years, it has become apparent that QS plays a role in the pathogenesis of many infectious diseases. For example, the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which causes chronic infections in cystic fibrosis patients, uses QS to regulate the production of virulence factors such as biofilms and toxins. The QS system in P. aeruginosa is composed of three different families of signal molecules: the N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs), the 2-alkyl-4-(methylthiazol-2-yl)-1-pentanol (ATPs), and the pyrazinoid derivatives (PAZs). Each family of signal molecules is synthesized by a different set of enzymes, and each family of signal molecules is able to regulate a different subset of genes in P. aeruginosa.
We traced the evolutionary origins of L1TD1, a protein-coding gene that is essential for the maintenance of pluripotency in mammalian stem cells. We found that L1TD1 originated from an L1 element that acquired a novel splice site and was domesticated in a primate ancestor of the family Cercopithecidae ( including macaques and baboons ). We then examined the evolution of L1TD1 in several primate and rodent species. We found that L1TD1 evolved rapidly and acquired a variety of unique protein-coding exons in many species. We also found that L1TD1 was lost from the genomes of some rodents, possibly because it was no longer needed for genome defense. Overall, our results suggest that L1TD1 was originally domesticated for a role in genome defense in a primate ancestor of the family Cercopithecidae, and later co-opted for a role in the maintenance of pluripotency in a subset of primates and rodents.
The provided content discusses the role of YbeY, an RNA-binding protein, in 70S ribosome stability and function in Vibrio cholerae. The authors demonstrate that YbeY is essential for 70S ribosome stability and function in V. cholerae. They show that YbeY binds to RNA and interacts with other ribosomal proteins. The authors also discuss the role of YbeY in the regulation of gene expression in V. cholerae and its importance for pathogenesis.
This study calculates the assortativity of human-specific transcription factor networks ( TFNs ). Assortativity measures how similar the in- and out-degrees of nodes are within a network. The authors found that out-out assortativity was the most prevalent assortativity type among human TFNs. They also demonstrated that out-out assortativity was linked to increased robustness to genetic perturbation. The study provides an assortativity signature for each human TFN, which could be useful in understanding how TFNs are structured and how this may influence their dynamics. Overall, the findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the topological properties of TFNs and how these may relate to their robustness.
In the mammalian brain, the collective activity of neuronal populations is thought to represent sensory information. However, it is unclear how neurons encode this information and whether all neuron types contribute equally to this process. In this study, we simultaneously recorded the activity of thousands of neurons from the barrel cortex of the anesthetized rat while the animal explores its whiskers. By computing the mutual information (MI) of individual neurons and ensembles of neurons with respect to sensory stimuli, we found that inhibitory neurons (INH) convey more information than excitatory neurons (EXC) about the whisker's location and frequency. This result challenges the prevailing view that EXC neurons carry the majority of the sensory information. Furthermore, we found that the sensory information conveyed by neuronal ensembles is significantly higher than the sum of the information provided by individual neurons, due to the presence of synergistic interactions between neurons. These findings provide a comprehensive view of how INH and EXC neurons encode sensory information and suggest that the collective activity of neuronal ensembles is critical for the representation of sensory information in the brain.
The paper you've just read is about the engineering of a genetic half adder, a fundamental arithmetic logic unit that can perform binary sums of information encoded in molecular concentrations. This is done using synthetic biology, specifically by using regulatory RNAs to do the computing. The system is designed to work in a living cell, where the result of the computation is fluorescence. This work is significant because it shows that regulatory RNAs can be used to create complex genetic circuits for computation. It also demonstrates that synthetic biology can be used to create new ways of computing that are different from traditional computers. This is important because it opens up new possibilities for how we can use biology to solve problems.
Cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II (cN-II) is a key enzyme involved in the maintenance of balanced nucleoside levels in the cell. It is a potential target for chemotherapy to enhance the efficacy of nucleoside analogues and to induce cell death. This study aimed to identify the role of cN-II in cancer cells and during cancer treatment by developing ribonucleoside phosphonate derivatives that could be used as inhibitors of cN-II. We utilized molecular docking and experimental in vitro nucleotidase activity measurements to identify the structural rules governing the efficacy of such inhibitors. Our results showed that the presence of a non-hydrolysable P-C bond in the β-hydroxyphosphonate analogues resulted in a full inhibition of the nucleotidase activity, with the best results obtained when the phosphonate analogue could mimic the 5′-oxygen atom present in the natural nucleoside monophosphate. These findings highlight the structural requirements for an effective inhibition of cN-II and provide a basis for the design of new and more potent inhibitors.
A recent study has shown that sheep incubating natural scrapie, a type of mad cow disease, excreted infectious prions in their milk and colostrum months before showing clinical signs of the disease. This raises concerns about the risk of transmission of scrapie to humans through dairy products from affected animals.
Liberia experienced an Ebola outbreak from March 2014 to January 2016. The authors analyzed data from 16,370 laboratory samples collected during this time period. They identified 10,536 individuals who were linked to these samples. Of these individuals, 3,897 were confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease. The authors found differences in the sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases. They also found that age (young children and the elderly) and place of residence (rural areas) were risk factors for death due to Ebola virus disease. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period. The authors suggest that their findings may help support future investigations and lead to a better understanding of the outbreak in Liberia.
The structure of tyrosinase, an enzyme that converts phenol and catechol to melanin, has been determined at high resolutions using X-ray crystallography. In the complex between tyrosinase and its partner protein, the copper ions are bound to the active center of tyrosinase through a caddie protein, and the crystal structure shows that a caddie protein inhibits tyrosinase activity. The crystal structure also shows that tyrosinase has a conserved structure among related enzymes, which suggests that the structure of tyrosinase is important for its function.
The goal of this study is to determine the role of the protein NPA1 in the processing of an important RNA molecule called RPII-70. NPA1 is a protein that is involved in the RNA processing machinery, and it is known to play a role in the processing of other RNA molecules. The authors used a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques to investigate the role of NPA1 in the processing of RPII-70. They found that NPA1 is required for the proper processing of RPII-70, and they also found that it plays a role in the formation of a complex with other proteins involved in RNA processing. These results provide important insights into the role of NPA1 in the processing of RNA molecules and suggest that it may be involved in the formation of a larger complex that is important for RNA processing.
The brain must adapt to changing environments to survive and reproduce. In this study, we investigated how well participants learn to predict changes in a simple task while experiencing environmental noise and a variable change point probability. We found that participants learned more efficiently when a pharmaceutical drug enhanced their ability to extract reliable information from environmental noise. We also found that participants’ learning rate was influenced by their beliefs about the frequency of change points and the precision of their predictions. Our findings provide new insights into how the brain adapts to changing environments.
Infectious diseases are a major problem for humanity. To help monitor them, two point-of-care laboratories (POC-L) were set up in rural Senegal villages. A syndromic surveillance system called EPIMIC was used to monitor infectious diseases using data collected by the POC-L. The system has been successfully used to monitor 15 different pathogens in the POC-L of Dielmo and Ndiop. In the POC-L of Niakhar, data were collected for five pathogens. The system can be easily implemented and customized for use in other countries.
In a recent study, the authors used computational modeling and microfabrication techniques to investigate the roles of structural arrangement in collective calcium signaling in endothelial cells. The authors found that endothelial cells in self-assembled networks and microengineered networks exhibited calcium oscillations in response to histamine stimulation, while individual cells and monolayers did not. The authors also found that the frequency of calcium oscillations depended on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junctional intercellular communication. The authors further demonstrated that the calcium oscillations attenuated the histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction, resulting in differential cell responses in an architecture-dependent manner. The authors concluded that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling.
This study investigates the protective capacity of the RSV G protein through the evaluation of several antigenic sites. These antigenic sites include the G-ectodomain lacking part of the central conserved domain ( CCD ), and the individual G-subdomains ( N- and C- termini ) , and G-derived peptides. These antigenic sites were evaluated by immunization of rabbits and mice, and by viral challenge studies in mice. The results of these studies indicate that several antigenic sites apart from the CCD motif in the G protein provide protective immunity against RSV. These findings may have important implications for the development of a RSV vaccine.
In this study, we investigate the role of RNA processing in the specification of a particular type of neuron, Tv4 neurons, in the ventral nerve cord of the fruit fly Drosophila. We show that two genes involved in RNA processing, brr2 and Prp8, play a crucial role in controlling the expression of the FMRFamide neuropeptide specifically in Tv4 neurons. We found that brr2 and Prp8 play these roles through two independent mechanisms, which are both required for the activation of the BMP retrograde signaling pathway in Tv4 neurons: (1) Proper axonal pathfinding to the target tissue, in order to receive the BMP ligand, and (2) Proper RNA splicing of two genes in the BMP pathway, tkv and Medea. These results reveal that RNA processing plays a specific role in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system.
The abundance of substrate receptor components of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) is tightly controlled to maintain the full repertoire of CRLs. Unbalanced levels can lead to sequestration of CRL core components by a few overabundant substrate receptors, which can cause diseases. Abundance of F-box proteins, the substrate receptors of the largest class of CRLs, is regulated by autocatalytic ubiquitylation by the intact SCF complex followed by proteasome-mediated degradation. A new pathway for regulation of F-box proteins was described on the example of yeast Met30. Unexpectedly, this pathway required the cullin component Cdc53/Cul1 but was independent of the other central SCF component Skp1. This non-canonical degradation pathway is critical for chromosome stability and effective defense against heavy metal stress. This research assigns important biological functions to a sub-complex of cullin-RING ligases that comprises Cdc53/Rbx1/Cdc34 but is independent of Skp1. The discovery of this new pathway may lead to new therapeutic approaches.
Kinesin-3 motors are responsible for moving cargo along microtubules in neuronal cells. However, the way that kinesin-3 motors work is not fully understood. In the current study, the authors wanted to learn more about how kinesin-3 motors work in neuronal cells. They used a protein called KIF1A, which is a kinesin-3 motor, to test their models. The authors found that KIF1A motors are dimeric in the inactive state, suggesting that they are autoinhibited. They also found that KIF1A motors can undergo processive motility, which means they move along the microtubule in a continuous manner, only when they are dimeric. This suggests that KIF1A motors may be uniquely suited to use both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells. Overall, the authors' findings provide important insights into how kinesin-3 motors work in neuronal cells.
The article provides a detailed description of the analysis of metabolic data collected from seeds and fruits of tomato plants. The data was collected from 76 different introgression lines (ILs) that were developed by crossing wild tomato species with cultivated tomato. The ILs were grown in the field and their seeds and fruits were collected for analysis. Metabolic profiling was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and the resulting data was used to construct metabolic networks. The authors used correlation analysis and network visualization techniques to identify metabolic pathways that are shared between seeds and fruits. They also identified metabolic pathways that are unique to seeds or fruits. The authors conclude that their analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic processes that occur in tomato seeds and fruits and that their results will be useful for understanding the genetic regulation of metabolic processes in plants.
This study reports the crystal structure of the chitin-binding protein GbpA, a virulence factor of Vibrio cholerae. The protein has a novel glycan-binding domain and is involved in colonization of both chitinous zooplankton and the human intestine. The structure of the protein was determined by X-ray crystallography and was found to be composed of four domains, three of which are involved in chitin binding. A glycan-binding domain in GbpA was identified and its binding specificity was characterized using a library of natural and synthetic glycans. The protein was also shown to bind to rabbit intestinal mucin in vitro, providing evidence for a role of GbpA in human colonization. This work provides insight into the mechanism of colonization of V. cholerae on chitinous zooplankton and the human intestine, and identifies a potential target for the development of new antibacterial agents.
In the current study, the authors investigate the role of HLA-DR+ Teff cells in the immune response of PTB patients. They performed flow cytometry on PBMCs from PTB patients, ATT-treated PTB patients, and healthy controls to determine the frequencies of HLA-DR+ Teff cells and their response to Mtb stimulation. The authors found that HLA-DR+ Teff cells were more abundant in ATT-treated PTB patients and healthy controls compared to PTB patients. Additionally, the authors observed that HLA-DR+ Teff cells were more responsive to Mtb stimulation in healthy controls and ATT-treated PTB patients compared to PTB patients. The authors also found that HLA-DR+ Teff cells expressed higher levels of PD-1, which was negatively correlated with IFN-γ secretion. These findings suggest that HLA-DR+ Teff cells play an important role in the immune response of PTB patients and may be a potential target for new therapeutic approaches.
The paper describes a study where tgGPI− mice, which have a mutation that prevents PrPC from being anchored to the cell membrane, are infected with different strains of scrapie. The authors then use a cell panel assay (SSCA) to determine the properties of the different prion strains in tgGPI− mice. They also compare the properties of the different strains after they are transferred back to wild-type mice. The authors find that while the RML strain of scrapie retains its original properties when transferred to wild-type mice, the SFL strain, which was stable in tgGPI− mice, becomes a new strain with different properties when transferred to wild-type mice. The authors suggest that the difference in properties between the RML and SFL strains in tgGPI− mice is due to a change in the conformation of PrPC that is separate from a change in the structure or expression level of GPI-less PrPC. They also suggest that the different replication modes of the RML and SFL strains in the extracellular space may be responsible for the different properties observed in tgGPI− mice.
The BMP signaling pathway is used to regulate many processes during development. In Drosophila, BMP signaling is required for the patterning of the dorsal-ventral axis of the embryo. This process involves a gradient of BMP signaling in which the Mad and Brk transcription factors play important roles. In this study, the authors use RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to determine the target genes of Mad and Brk in the process of dorsal-ventral axis patterning. They identify multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of the EGF signaling pathway. The authors also show that EGF signaling negatively regulates BMP-responsive transcription and that the BMP gene network has a self-regulating property. In addition, the authors identify key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in the BMP response. They also find widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brk-bound genomic regions. The authors provide a model for Mad-dependent activation that is relevant to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates.
In Tunisia , the cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major are increasing and spreading from the south-west to new areas in the center . To study the evolution and population dynamics of L . major in Tunisia, the researchers performed multi-locus microsatellite typing of human isolates from different governorates where the disease is endemic and collected during two periods: 1991–1992 and 2008–2012. They analyzed the genetic patterns of isolates collected in Sidi Bouzid in 1991–1992 and 2008–2012, and those from three governorates: Gafsa, Kairouan and Sidi Bouzid in 2008–2012. The analysis showed that over two decades, in the same area, L . major evolved by generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of isolates from 2008–2012 indicate that L . major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia, according to a geographical gradient, suggesting that human activities might be the source of the disease expansion. The study provides new insights into the evolution and spread of L . major in Tunisia that might improve our understanding of the parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations.
In a randomized trial of HIV-infected adults in Kenya, we found that access to safe floors was the most protective WASH access variable against helminth infections of any species, while access to improved latrines was the most protective WASH variable against schistosomiasis. Access to safe water was not associated with reduced helminth infection prevalence.
In this study, the crystal structure of LlpABW, a novel antibacterial lectin-like protein from the plant pathogen Pseudomonas putida, is presented. LlpABW contains two domains with a lectin-like fold, and its activity is highly specific to Pseudomonas and some related phytopathogens. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of action of LlpABW, and suggests that this protein could be used as a model for the development of new antibacterial agents.
The paper presents a study on the mechanisms of Bacillus subtilis spore formation. Spore formation is a complex process involving many different proteins and genetic regulators. The authors have identified a new protein called SpoIIIA that is involved in the late stage of spore formation. They have also found that the protein has ATPase motifs and is required for the activity of the transcription factor σG. The authors have shown that SpoIIIA and a related protein called SpoIIQ form a multimeric complex that spans the two membranes surrounding the forespore. They have also shown that this complex is required to maintain forespore integrity. Overall, the study provides important insights into the mechanisms of spore formation in Bacillus subtilis.
We analyzed data from 11 collection sites in the BiGS Consortium to identify genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder, a complex psychiatric disorder. By combining data from multiple studies, we were able to increase the sample size and power to detect small genetic effects that may not be detectable in a single study. We used a multilocus approach to identify genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder. We first identified genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder in one study, and then we tested the same variants in a second, independent study. We found that genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder in one study were also associated with the disorder in the second study, but only if there was evidence for a strong genetic effect. This finding suggests that our approach was able to identify genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder that have a strong genetic effect on the disorder. This information can help researchers identify specific genetic variants that may be useful for future drug development or genetic counseling. Our study shows the importance of using multiple studies to increase the power to detect genetic effects and to validate the results of a single study.
In this study, the authors developed a new approach to understanding cell proliferation based on gene expression and growth rate measurements. They assigned each gene a proliferation index (PI) that reflects its association with growth rate measurements across a set of cancer samples. They found that genes found essential in cancer gene knockdown screens exhibited significant positive PI values, while tumor suppressors exhibited significant negative PI values. They also found that cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production related processes were positively associated with cancer proliferation. Furthermore, they found that cancer proliferation was negatively associated with cellular migration. They also compared the genes whose expression is associated with cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation. Their results highlight genes in the translation and spliceosome machineries as selective cancer proliferation-associated proteins. They also compared their results with previous genome-scale studies of cancer proliferation determinants and found that their approach was complementary to previous shRNA knockdown screens. Overall, their results point to an inherent difference between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation determinants and suggest that understanding these differences could contribute to the future development of novel cancer-specific anti-proliferative drugs.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a disease caused by a parasite that can infect the heart and the vena cava, but not many cases have been reported. This study is a review of 11 patients who had CE in the heart or the vena cava and were followed up for 15 years. Most of the patients had symptoms such as thoracic pain or dyspnea, and their cysts were located mostly in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Some patients had been previously diagnosed with CE, and echocardiography was the main diagnostic method. Nine patients underwent cardiac surgery, nine received long-term antiparasitic treatment, and one patient was lost to follow-up. One patient died intra-operatively, two patients died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure, respectively. Patients who had cardiac involvement exclusively did not have complications after surgery, while patients with vena cava involvement developed serious complications. The study recommends that CE should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases in patients from endemic areas.
This study confirms the presence of a TirS-like protein in S . aureus that interferes with the TLR2-induced signaling pathway and enhances bacterial survival within the host. Interestingly, the tirS gene is invariably located within the mobile genetic element SCC476 of MSSA strains. Moreover, our work shows that sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid induce overexpression of tirS . This suggests that tirS may confer resistance to antibiotics in a subset of MRSA and MSSA strains . Our findings also confirm previous reports of negative regulation of the TLR signaling pathway by TirS expression . Furthermore, we demonstrate that TirS modulates bacterial virulence through attenuation of host inflammatory responses during infection .
We used gene expression datasets for the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae to search for changes in gene expression that might explain differences in the two species' embryonic morphologies. We found that many orthologous gene pairs could be clustered based on the presence of coincident discordances in their temporal expression profiles. One such cluster contained genes specifically expressed in the mosquito serosa. We also found a striking difference in the temporal expression of a subset of maternal genes. We propose that gene clustering by local temporal discordance can be used to identify the gene batteries underlying morphological diversity.
The study found that DNA from H. ducreyi and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue, two major causes of leg ulcers in children in Africa and the Pacific Region, were present on the skin of asymptomatic children. The study also found that T. pallidum subsp. pertenue and H. ducreyi DNA were present in flies and on household linens. This is the first time that H. ducreyi DNA and colonization has been demonstrated on the skin of asymptomatic children and that H. ducreyi DNA and T. pallidum subsp. pertenue DNA has been identified in flies and on fomites. These findings suggest that the environment plays a role in the spread of the organisms, which could contribute to their persistence in the community and their transmission. This study provides evidence for the need to address environmental factors to control the spread of these organisms.
Bioinformatics is a rapidly growing field that involves the use of computing and mathematics to analyze and interpret biological data. However, there is currently no consensus on what knowledge and skills are necessary for individuals to be successful in this field. The Curriculum Task Force of the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) has created a set of core competencies that can be used as a framework for training in bioinformatics. These competencies have been developed through surveys and community engagement, and are designed to be applicable across a wide range of user personas and training programs. The report provides a series of use cases that demonstrate how the competencies can be applied in diverse training contexts, including complete degree programs, supplements to existing degree programs, and training resources outside the context of specific degree programs. These use cases illustrate how the competencies can be used to define, refine, or assess a bioinformatics training mechanism.
A Strongyloides stercoralis transcriptome was generated using RNA sequencing of seven different developmental stages. Transcriptome analysis revealed that S. stercoralis dauer-like development is regulated by conserved signaling pathways and that S. stercoralis may possess an expanded repertoire of TGFβ ligands.
The study evaluated the effects of bacterial genotoxins on nuclear remodeling, including the formation of nucleoplasmic reticulum ( NR ) in vitro and in vivo. The study used mouse models, coculture experiments with CDT- and colibactin-secreting bacteria, and hepatic, intestinal, and gastric cells. The results showed that CDT and colibactin induced NR formation and the concentration of ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and the main components of the complex mCRD involved in mRNA turnover in the NR. The study suggests that the NR would be a privileged gateway for selected mRNA to be preferentially transported therein for local translation. These findings offer new insights into the context of NR formation, a common feature of many cancers.
This study aimed to evaluate facial deformities in people who had leprosy using three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT). The authors compared CT images of the maxilla in people who had leprosy (former patients with leprosy) and those who did not have leprosy (control subjects). They found that some people who had leprosy had deformities in the maxilla, which supports the results of paleopathological studies of excavated skeletal remains. The authors also were able to quantify the thickness of the maxillary bone defects using CT images, which could be helpful for reconstructive surgery.
The present study is a review of the impact of background noise on auditory coding in the brain. The review is structured into five main sections: (1) Background noise in the auditory environment, (2) Background noise and adaptation in the auditory periphery, (3) Background noise and adaptation in the midbrain, (4) Background noise and adaptation in the thalamus, and (5) Background noise and adaptation in the cortex. The review provides a comprehensive overview of the current research in this area and highlights important gaps in our understanding of how the brain adapts to background noise. Overall, the review highlights the need for more research to understand how background noise affects the encoding of complex sounds in the brain.
In this study, the authors use protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to analyze changes in yeast cellular organization under heat shock stress. They find that heat shock results in a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections of yeast interactome modules, leading to a more fragmented interactome structure. The authors suggest that this change may be a general adaptation response to environmental changes and provide a model of network-level organization under stress.
Chagas disease is a serious health problem in Latin America, and now there is growing concern about its spread to other parts of the world. Amiodarone is a drug that has been used to treat the abnormal heart rhythms that can be caused by Chagas disease. The purpose of this study was to see if amiodarone works in people with Chagas disease. The researchers searched for studies in which amiodarone was given to people with Chagas disease, and they found 9 studies that met their criteria. In 5 of these studies, the researchers could use information from each patient to analyze the results individually, while in the other 4 studies, they had to use group data. The researchers looked at how many people in each group had ventricular tachycardia, ventricular premature beats, or ventricular couplets before and after taking amiodarone. They also looked at how many people in each group had side effects from the drug. The researchers then combined the results from the studies to see if there was a clear effect of amiodarone on these outcomes. They found that amiodarone reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes, ventricular premature beats, and the incidence of ventricular couplets. However, there was no evidence that amiodarone reduced hard endpoints like sudden death or hospitalization. The researchers also found that amiodarone was associated with side effects like corneal microdeposits, gastrointestinal events, sinus bradycardia, dermatological events, and drug discontinuation. Overall, the researchers concluded that amiodarone appears to be effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias in people with Chagas disease, but more research is needed to determine its long-term safety and efficacy.
The paper is a medical record review study that aimed to determine the seasonality of dengue fever in rural Ecuador. The study found that dengue fever diagnoses followed a single annual peak in case counts during mid-March, and were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays than on Saturdays or Sundays. Public holidays, such as the day after Christmas, were associated with an increase in dengue diagnoses. The study also found that school schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. Finally, the study found that the effect of climate on the seasonality of dengue fever diagnoses is complex and multifactorial.
The paper "Amplification of a Constitutively Active Innate Immune State by Expression of a Stable Form of Picornavirus RdRP" describes the authors' findings that expression of a form of the picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) that is constitutively active can induce a powerful, sustained antiviral immune response. This response is characterized by upregulation of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and is independent of the presence of viral RNA. The authors also show that this response is mediated by the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) pathway, and that it is not associated with autoimmune disease or chronic inflammation. These findings suggest that manipulation of the RdRP-RIG-I pathway may be a promising approach for the development of novel antiviral therapies.
In this study, the infection dynamics of two closely related plant viruses, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato yellow leaf curl RNA virus (TYLCV-RNA), were analyzed. The study found that both viruses followed the independent action hypothesis (IAH), which suggests that each virus infects host plants independently, without interfering with the other. The study also found that the genetic diversity of TYLCV-RNA was reduced during horizontal transmission, and that the genetic diversity of viruses in systemically infected plants was lower than in primary infection foci. These findings suggest that the host plant's immune system may be involved in reducing genetic diversity during horizontal transmission. The study also found that the ratio of mixed-genotype infections in plants infected with both viruses was not significantly different from what would be expected under the IAH. This suggests that the two viruses are not antagonistic towards each other, and that they may even be synergistic in some cases. Overall, the study provides important insights into the infection dynamics of plant viruses and the role of the host plant's immune system in shaping these dynamics.
In this study, we propose a new statistical method for identifying genes that are regulated by multiple genetic factors. We applied this method to rat gene expression data in four tissues and identified genes that are regulated in cis or in trans. We also compared our method to two other methods and found that our method had higher power to detect shared genetic regulation of gene expression across tissues. These findings highlight the importance of jointly analyzing gene expression across tissues in order to identify genes that are regulated by multiple genetic factors.
A mathematical model of caspase-dependent apoptosis has been developed based on experimental data. The model includes a range of upstream and downstream reactions and accurately reproduces the behavior of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The model identifies the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation as a variable-delay, snap-action switch that controls the timing of cell death. The duration of this delay is determined by the activity of initiator caspase-8 and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. The snap-action switch is regulated by the interplay between Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanisms of pore assembly. The model has been used to identify a role for C8 and its substrates in pre-MOMP delay and to explore how competition among pro- and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members determines when MOMP occurs. Multiple alternative topologies for reactions involving Bcl-2-like proteins were examined and a subtle interplay between protein compartmentalization, translocation, and multimerization was uncovered in the regulation of snap-action switching.
In this study, we used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify a novel host protein that interacts with the bacterial invasin Listeria monocytogenes internalin (Inl) protein. We found that the host protein, a previously unknown protein called afadin, binds to Inl through its LRR5 domain. This interaction occurs in the cytoplasm of the host cell and may contribute to the ability of L. monocytogenes to invade host cells. We also found that afadin is expressed in the human placenta, and that it may be involved in the ability of L. monocytogenes to invade the placenta and cause infection.
The proteome of the T . pallidum spirochete is the most abundant and diverse group of proteins in the human body. In this study, we present the first mass spectrometry-based proteomics characterization of T . pallidum. We present a comprehensive description of the proteome of T . pallidum, including information about protein abundance, subcellular localization, and functional annotation. Our results provide insights into the fundamental biology of this organism and may help guide the development of new therapeutic approaches.
Protein Kinase A ( PKA ) is a protein that plays a key role in cell signaling. It is regulated by the binding of cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) and the subunits of PKA. A recent study has investigated the effects of the two-domain construct RIα on the activity of PKA. The study used nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) to investigate the changes in the structure of RIα in its apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms. The findings of the study suggest that CBD-B in RIα plays a critical role in the inhibition and activation of PKA. The study also showed that CBD-A is important for the activation of PKA and that inter-domain dynamics affect the binding of cAMP to CBD-A.
In this article, the authors describe a proteomic analysis of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) infected with vaccinia virus. They compared the proteomes of ISG15-deficient and ISG15-sufficient BMDM infected with vaccinia virus and identified a number of differentially expressed proteins. They also investigated the role of ISG15 in regulating the mitochondrial metabolism and found that ISG15 deficiency decreased the activity of complex I and II of the electron transport chain and the activity of citrate synthase. Additionally, they found that ISG15 deficiency increased the levels of reactive oxygen species and the activity of arginase, which is an enzyme involved in the urea cycle. These findings suggest that ISG15 plays an important role in regulating the mitochondrial metabolism and the production of reactive oxygen species in BMDM infected with vaccinia virus.
The proteasome is a powerful machine that breaks down unwanted or damaged proteins to their component parts. Proteins are marked for degradation by being "ubiquitinated" with small molecules called ubiquitin. The proteasome reads the "ubiquitin code" and breaks down the marked proteins. Viruses have found ways to manipulate the proteasome for their own needs. The human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protein called Vpu helps the virus infect new cells by hijacking the proteasome. Vpu is a small, membrane-bound protein that is important for HIV-1 to infect human cells. It helps the virus to escape from the immune system of the host, allowing it to replicate and spread throughout the body. It also helps the virus to release its infectious particles more efficiently. Vpu can do this because it binds to a protein called βTrCP, which is part of the proteasome. By binding to βTrCP, Vpu is able to direct it to degrade other proteins that are important for the immune system. This helps the virus to survive and continue to replicate in the host. The ability of Vpu to degrade these proteins makes it an important part of the HIV-1 virus. It helps the virus to infect new cells and spread throughout the body. Without Vpu, the HIV-1 virus would have a harder time infecting new cells and spreading throughout the body.
Developmental processes must be coordinated so that they generate correct tissues. Tissues develop from cells that, through a process called patterning, acquire specific identities. These identities result from the coordinated expression of patterning genes. We have proposed two hypotheses on how tissue patterning is coordinated with whole-body development, either by tight coordination or by alignment at developmental milestones. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we have developed a staging scheme for wing imaginal discs of third instar Drosophila larvae based on the expression of canonical patterning genes. We have used this scheme to explore how the progression of pattern changes when developmental time is altered either by changing temperature or by altering the timing of hormone synthesis that drives developmental progression. We found that the progression of pattern is tightly coordinated with moulting and pupariation, representing developmental milestones, but shows greater variability between these milestones. Our data showed that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage. Thus for wing disc patterning, wandering does not appear to be a developmental milestone. Our findings reveal that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones. Furthermore, our work provides an important glimpse into how the development of individual tissues is coordinated with the body as a whole.
The ESCRT complex is a key regulator of endosome-mediated transport in fungal hyphae. Loss of the ESCRT regulator Did2 results in defective vacuolar targeting, less processive long-distance transport and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. These defects suggest that Did2 coordinates endosomal maturation and thus provides the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport. Moreover, the ESCRT regulator Vps60 is required for the efficient attachment of molecular motors to early endosomes. These findings provide important insights into the function of ESCRT complexes in the coordination of endosomal transport.
The B . subtilis add gene encodes a riboswitch that binds adenine and positively regulates the expression of the downstream gene. Two variants of the add riboswitch were generated by site-directed mutagenesis: one variant is unable to bind adenine and the other binds adenine with a lower affinity. The results show that the ability of the riboswitch to bind adenine determines whether it can be transcribed by a T7 RNA polymerase in vitro. The in vivo regulation of the add gene by the add riboswitch was examined by generating single-copy chromosomal insertions of the add'-lacZ and addOFF'-lacZ fusions in E . coli. The results show that the add gene is upregulated in the presence of adenine. The regulation of the add gene by the add riboswitch is a kinetic process that depends on the rate of transcription and on the NusA elongation factor.
We demonstrate that the physiological role of transcription initiation from primers is more widespread than previously thought and is utilized by many species of bacteria. We also show that PDI in E. coli and V. cholerae is growth phase-dependent, and the primers involved in PDI in these species are derived from species-specific dinucleotides.
Here, we report that increased dosage of the maternal genome in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds causes a decrease in expression levels of the maternal imprinted gene MEA and a corresponding increase in expression of the paternal imprinted gene PHE1. This change is accompanied by a loss of imprinting of MEA and PHE1. We suggest that this imprinting deregulation results from changes in the expression of the paternal FIS2 gene, a key component of the Polycomb group complex. These results are unexpected, as we had previously shown that increased paternal dosage causes an increase in expression of MEA and a decrease in expression of PHE1. We propose that parental dosage imbalance in seeds causes a complex series of non-symmetrical responses that disrupt the imprinted gene network, which in turn may contribute to species isolation mechanisms.
This article presents a new method for reconstructing virtual brains using EEG and MEG recordings, and comparing them to real brains. The authors first hypothesize that the dynamics of these brain recordings are caused by underlying functional connectivity between the brain's nodes, rather than by the anatomy or synaptic connections between them. They then use mathematical techniques to reverse-engineer network configurations that generate the same dynamics as the EEG and MEG recordings. They find that the virtual brains they construct share common features with real brains, and are able to replicate various aspects of epileptic and schizophrenic diseases. The authors conclude that the method they present has the potential to provide new insights into the neural basis of diseases, and to serve as a tool for developing new therapies.
The current study is a population genetics analysis of 6,441 unrelated individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) who self-identified as Hispanic and were of Central or South American, Dominican, Mexican, or Puerto Rican ancestry. The purpose of the study was to determine whether different Hispanic ethnic groups have distinct genetic ancestry profiles, and whether they can be distinguished using genome-wide ancestry markers. The study found four distinct subgroups of Hispanics, each with a unique pattern of genetic ancestry, and that these subgroups can be distinguished using a set of 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the lipoprotein gene region. The study also found that the four subgroups have distinct patterns of genetic ancestry that are associated with different levels of triglyceride, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The findings suggest that different Hispanic ethnic groups may have different genetic susceptibilities to cardiovascular disease, and that genetic ancestry information may be useful for identifying individuals at high risk for the disease.
The study found that Elp3, a subunit of the Elongator histone acetyltransferase complex, is required for transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability. Elp3 interacts with proteins involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly and with PCNA, a component of the DNA replication machinery. The Elongator complex is required for replication-independent nucleosome assembly and for histone H4K8 acetylation in vivo. Additionally, the study showed that Elp3 interacts with the Hat1 histone acetyltransferase and that the SAM domain of Elp3 is required for its interactions with Elp2 and PCNA. The findings provide insight into the functions of the Elongator complex in maintaining genome stability and support its role in the regulation of chromatin structure.
We propose a machine learning-based method for triage of publications relevant for variant curation in two external knowledge bases: UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog. We use convolutional neural networks (CNN) as our classification models and trained them using a dataset of publications that have been manually curated as either relevant or not relevant for variant curation. We evaluated our method on a test set of publications and compared its performance to that of the current query-based triage method. Our method outperforms the current query-based method by 1.81 and 2.99 times in precision and recall, respectively, without compromising recall. It also improves the efficiency of the triage process by reducing the number of false positives.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common clinical arrhythmia. Genetic mutations in ion channels can lead to a variety of arrhythmias, including AF. Kir2.1 channels play an important role in stabilizing the resting membrane potential of cardiac myocytes. In this study, we used a computational model of the human atrial action potential to investigate the effects of Kir2.1 mutations on the repolarization of the action potential and the susceptibility of the atria to re-entrant excitation. We found that Kir2.1 mutations could shorten the action potential duration and increase the excitation threshold. We also investigated the effects of Kir2.1 mutations on the wave length of re-entrant excitation, which was decreased in both homozygous and heterozygous Kir2.1 mutations. We found that combined block of IKr and IKur could be an effective strategy for treating AF in Kir2.1 mutations. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying atrial arrhythmias caused by Kir2.1 mutations and may help guide the development of new treatments for these arrhythmias.
Chagas disease is a serious illness caused by a parasite transmitted mainly by insects. It affects around 7 million people worldwide, particularly in Latin America, and is often fatal. In this study, researchers used adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASC) to treat a mouse model of chagas disease and showed that these cells can significantly reduce heart inflammation and parasite burden. The researchers also analyzed the effects of ASC on the immune system and found that they help to modulate the inflammatory response. Overall, this study highlights the potential of ASC to treat chagas disease.
Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is caused by parasites from the genus Leishmania that live inside mammalian cells in a specialized organelle called the parasitophorous vacuole (LPV). Retro-2cycl is a small molecule that disrupts the retrograde transport machinery in mammalian cells, leading to reduced LPV development and parasite numbers in infected macrophages. DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36 . 1 are optimized analogs of Retro-2cycl that are even more potent at limiting parasite growth in infected macrophages. These compounds also caused a reversal of Leishmania-induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Importantly, these analogs are Leishmania-cidal, meaning they kill the parasites directly. These findings suggest that Retro-2cycl and its analogs could be useful drugs for the treatment of leishmaniasis.
We developed a new method of predicting nucleosome sensitivity for a given transcription factor binding site within the mouse Ly49 gene family, and confirmed this prediction using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq) in a mouse NK cell line. We found that the AML-1a transcription factor is particularly sensitive to nucleosome positioning, and this sensitivity is predictive of its binding to specific promoter sequences. Our work suggests that nucleosome positioning may play a role in regulating the expression of Ly49 genes in vivo.
In a recent study, we investigated the role of cyclin H-CDK7 complex in CDK4 and CDK6 activation in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells . Previous studies had demonstrated that CDK4 and CDK6 are activated by CAK/CDK7, but our study revealed that CDK4 and CDK6 can also be activated by other CAKs . We used a K7AS mutant of CDK7 that is specifically inhibited by bulky adenine analogs to demonstrate that CDK4 and CDK6 are activated in a CDK7-independent manner . This finding is supported by the observation that T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 is differentially regulated in cyclin D1 or cyclin D3 complexes, which is not compatible with the requirement of CAK/CDK7 for CDK4 phosphorylation. We also demonstrated that CDK4 and CDK6 are activated by one or several proline-directed kinases ( s ) that are different from CAK/CDK7. This is supported by the observation that CDK4 phosphorylation can be differentially regulated in cyclin D1 or cyclin D3 complexes. Finally, we demonstrated that CDK4 phosphorylation can be abrogated by mutation of the P173 site in CDK4, whereas the T172 site remains unchanged, indicating that CDK4 can be phosphorylated in a CAK-independent manner. In summary, our study has uncovered a complex network of interactions and pathways that regulate CDK4 and CDK6 activation in human colon carcinoma cells. This new knowledge could provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying the defective regulation of cell cycle checkpoints in many tumors.
In this study, the authors report the identification and characterization of DUET, a plant-specific transcription factor that is essential for meiosis in Arabidopsis. They found that DUET interacts with chromatin via its PHD finger, and that its PHD finger binds H3K4me2 in vitro. They also found that duet plants exhibit defects in chromosome condensation and segregation, and abnormal microtubule organization during meiosis II. The authors identified TDM1 and JAS as targets of DUET, and found that both genes are meiosis-specifically expressed and are required for cell cycle transitions during meiosis I and II, respectively. They also found that duet expresses only during diplotene stage of prophase I, suggesting a possible role for DUET in regulating male meiotic gene expression.
The Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the nervous system and causes intellectual disability, autism, and seizures. The disease is caused by the expansion of a repeat sequence of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) gene, which leads to the decrease of FMRP protein in the brain. Researchers have found that the fragile X protein repeat (rCGG) sequence can cause toxicity in fruit flies by interacting with other proteins in the cell. In this study, the authors used fly models and mass spectrometry to identify proteins that interact with the fragile X protein repeat. They found that the repeat sequence can bind to several proteins, including the helicase protein Rm62. The authors also showed that the fragile X protein repeat can affect the expression of other genes in the cell, leading to the accumulation of mRNA in the nucleus. These findings suggest that the fragile X protein repeat can cause toxicity in the brain by affecting the expression of other genes and interacting with other proteins.
In this study, the authors examined the biofilm matrix of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa using a combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy and fluorescence-labeled lectins. They found that the matrix is composed of multiple exopolysaccharides, including polysaccharide A (Psl), which is the focus of the study. The authors observed that Psl is anchored to the bacterial cell surface through a helical structure and that it encases the bacteria in the biofilm in a fibrous matrix. They also showed that the matrix undergoes changes during the maturation of the biofilm, such as the degradation of Psl in the center of the microcolony. These findings provide insight into the structure and function of the biofilm matrix in P. aeruginosa and may have implications for the development of new antimicrobial therapies.
This study examined the concordance of somatic mutations and structural variations between primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and its matched patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and organoid (PDO) disease models. While PDXs and PDACs shared most of their single nucleotide variants, only a subset of structural variations and copy number changes were concordant between PDAC and PDX. In contrast, PDOs displayed a similar mutational profile as PDAC but had a higher rate of somatic mutations, which could be explained by the in vitro selection of PDAC organoids. This study highlights the challenges associated with recapitulating the mutational profile of PDAC in patient-derived disease models and suggests that a combination of PDX and PDO models may be necessary to better understand PDAC.
The study provides strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by rs9485372, near the TAB2 gene. Two other possible breast cancer susceptibility loci were also identified on chromosomes 11q24.3 and 12q14.1. The findings are based on a large-scale genome-wide association study that included over 19,000 breast cancer cases and 20,606 controls from East Asian countries. The study has important implications for understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer, identifying high-risk individuals, and developing targeted prevention and treatment strategies.
This study provides an overview of cryptococcal meningitis, a serious and often fatal disease caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. The authors discuss the importance of understanding genetic diversity and virulence factors associated with the disease in order to develop new treatments and improve patient outcomes. They describe a cohort of 230 HIV-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis from South Africa, and analyze their clinical presentation and outcomes, as well as their genetic diversity and virulence phenotypes. The authors find that the genetic diversity of the fungus is high in South Africa, and that certain lineages are associated with different virulence traits. They also find that certain lineages are associated with different clinical outcomes, including survival rates. The authors conclude that a better understanding of the genetic diversity and virulence factors of cryptococcal meningitis is important for developing new treatments and improving patient outcomes.
A novel signal transduction pathway that regulates filamentous growth in the yeast Candida albicans was discovered using a novel experimental strategy that compares gene expression patterns in different genetic backgrounds. The pathway is composed of three different genetic modules, each of which may have evolved from a different ancestral pathway. The discovery of this novel pathway may provide insights into the evolution of yeast signal transduction pathways.
The genomic GC-content of bacteria varies dramatically, from less than 20% to more than 70%. Researchers have tried to explain this variation by suggesting that it is due to differences in the pattern of mutation between bacteria. Here, the authors used datasets from 149 bacterial species to examine patterns of synonymous polymorphism and found that there is a large excess of synonymous GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations. They showed that this excess is inconsistent with mutation bias, since it would imply that most GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content, which is unsustainable. They also showed that the patterns are probably not due to translational selection or biased gene conversion because optimal codons tend to be AT-rich, and the excess of GC→AT SNPs is observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. The authors therefore conclude that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated with genomic GC-content, they further conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria.
The study aimed to develop a Bayesian geostatistical model to predict the observed prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infection across Kenya, using data from over 1000 cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1974 and 2009. The model was used to estimate the spatial distribution of the combined observed prevalence of STH infection and the probability that this prevalence exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) intervention threshold of 20%. The study found that endemicity was high around the shores of Lake Victoria and on the coast, with most districts requiring treatment. The model was also used to estimate the school-aged population at risk of infection and requiring MDA, which was projected to be 2.8 million children. The study highlights the importance of accurate geographical information in STH control programmes and the need for regular monitoring to ensure that interventions are targeted at the areas of highest need.
The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) involves innate and adaptive immune cells, which work together to control the infection. This study investigates the role of innate lymphocytes in immunity to Mtb. The authors establish an in vitro system using splenocytes and infected macrophages to study the effects of innate lymphocytes on the growth of Mtb. They find that splenocytes inhibit the growth of Mtb, and that this effect is dependent on CD1d-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. The authors also adoptively transfer iNKT cells into mice infected with Mtb and find that these cells protect the mice against the infection. The study provides important insights into the role of innate lymphocytes in immunity to Mtb.
In the spore of the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a transglutaminase named Tgl is responsible for cross-linking coat proteins to fortify the coat. Tgl is produced in an active form, and efficiently catalyzes amine incorporation and protein cross-linking in vitro. The absence of regulatory factors raises questions about how the activity of Tgl is controlled during spore coat assembly. Here, we show that the localization of Tgl is regulated by the prior assembly of its substrates. The Q side of Tgl makes a more important contribution to assembly of the enzyme than the K side. The enzyme becomes part of the cross-linked products. We suggest that Tgl exerts a “spotwelding” activity to covalently fortify pre-assembled complexes at the surface of the developing spore.
Opisthorchis viverrini is a type of parasite that can cause liver disease in people who eat raw or undercooked fish. A survey was done in Champasack province, Laos, to see how many people are infected and what factors might be related to this. Surveys and questionnaires were done in 51 villages, and people's stool samples were checked for the presence of parasites. Environmental factors, such as the type of vegetation, temperature, rainfall, and proximity to water bodies, were also considered. The results showed that 61.1% of people in the survey were infected with O. viverrini, and that several factors were associated with infection, including age, ethnicity, education level, occupation, access to clean water, and history of praziquantel treatment. Environmental factors, such as temperature, rainfall, and proximity to water bodies, were also found to be related to infection. The study found that the highest rates of infection were in the Mekong Valley, where there are many fish farms and people often eat raw or undercooked fish. The study also identified several risk factors for infection, including age, ethnicity, education level, occupation, access to clean water, and history of praziquantel treatment. Environmental factors, such as temperature, rainfall, and proximity to water bodies, were also related to infection. Overall, the study provides valuable information that can be used to develop targeted interventions to control the spread of O. viverrini in Laos.
This article describes a study conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to understand the types of aquatic habitats in the city that are important breeding sites for disease vectors. The study found that drains were the most common type of habitat that contained Anopheles and Culex larvae, and that the presence of larvae was associated with several factors, including the presence of human-made connections that blocked water flow, the presence of waste materials, the presence of vegetation, and the location of the drain in a residential area. These findings highlight the importance of drains as breeding sites for disease vectors and suggest that efforts to control disease transmission in Dar es Salaam should focus on managing drains.
The cellular host of Zika virus (ZIKV) has been extensively studied, especially its ability to replicate in human cells, such as neural stem cells and microglia. ZIKV has also been found to replicate in various mouse models, including embryos, newborns, and adult mice. One of the most widely used mouse models for ZIKV research is the A129 mouse strain, which lacks type I interferon receptors. These mice are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection, and can be used to study the pathogenesis of ZIKV in the brain and other tissues. Several mouse models have been developed to mimic the human response to ZIKV infection, including knockout mice for various cytokines and chemokines. These models have helped researchers to understand the immune response to ZIKV infection in mice and humans.
We used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome to create a quantitative bridge between kinetic measurements and the energy landscape of ribosomal translocation. We identified sets of residues that undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function, and estimated the diffusion coefficients along these coordinates. These measures were used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape, providing an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation. Our analysis is general and may be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states.
In this study, the authors sequenced the genomes of 84 sporadic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) patients and identified 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes. They also discovered anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements in two patients by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5’ fusion partner of ALK, customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients. The authors found that two patients had the glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK fusion and the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion. The GFPT1-ALK fusion was a result of an intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion, whereas the EML4-ALK fusion was a result of a translocation between chromosomes 5 and 22. The authors also noted that a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. They suggested that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors. The authors also noted that the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy.
The paper describes a study that was conducted to determine the role of asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the district of Malda, West Bengal. The study used rapid diagnostic tests to identify asymptomatic carriers, who were then followed for three years to observe the pattern of sero-conversion and disease transformation. Out of 2603 people screened, 79 were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis cases and 10 as active VL cases. Seven (9.09%) of the asymptomatic cases remained sero-positive even after three years, and progression to clinical disease among asymptomatic individuals was taking place at any time up to three years after the baseline survey. The study suggests that asymptomatic leishmaniasis cases need to be given more attention in order to successfully eliminate VL.
We used the MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification) technique to analyze Ty1-mediated GCRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. MLPA is a PCR-based method that allows for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of multiple genomic regions. We found that Ty1-mediated translocations were predominantly mediated by a small number of translocation targets. We also observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations that were mediated by RAD52-independent recombination. Finally, we found that defects in acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications. Overall, we found that MLPA is a versatile technique that can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy.
Protein-protein docking is the process of predicting the structure of a complex between two proteins. The problem is formulated as finding the lowest energy conformation of a rigid body structure where the two proteins are in contact. The free energy of a structure is estimated by a sum of various terms, including a desolvation term, an electrostatic term, and a van der Waals term. The search for the lowest energy conformation is carried out using a combination of rigid body docking and flexible local minimization. The rigid body docking is carried out using the FFT correlation approach, which samples billions of docked conformations. The conformations are clustered using pairwise RMSD as the distance metric. The best clusters are selected based on their size and are retained for flexible local minimization. The flexible local minimization is carried out using the Charmm potential, which allows for side-chain flexibility. The search for the lowest energy conformation is carried out using an iterative process where the current conformation is used as the starting point for the next iteration. The search process is terminated when a hit with a ligand binding site RMSD of less than 5 Å is found.
