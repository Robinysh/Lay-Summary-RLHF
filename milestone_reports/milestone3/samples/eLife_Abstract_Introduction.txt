The study investigated the role of the Notch signaling pathway in cell fate decisions. Notch signaling has been implicated in various cell-fate decisions, such as the decision between proliferation and differentiation, cellular reprograming, and conversion of one cell type into another. This study focused on the role of Notch signaling in reprograming in intact organisms using the C. elegans germline. The study found that Notch signaling facilitates reprograming of germ cells into somatic cells by activating specific genes that are silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). The conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 was identified as a crucial target of Notch signaling that facilitates reprograming. These findings suggest that Notch signaling plays a role in the epigenetic regulation of cell fate decisions in intact organisms.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a bacterium that can cause severe infections. Researchers have found that a protein called SKAP2 is important for protecting against K . pneumoniae lung infections in mice. Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, are the first line of defense against infections and SKAP2 helps them fight against K . pneumoniae by producing reactive oxygen species, which can kill the bacteria. Without SKAP2, the immune system has a harder time fighting against K . pneumoniae, leading to higher bacterial counts in the lungs and a more severe infection. The research team found that the signaling pathways that lead to reactive oxygen species production are tightly controlled and SKAP2 is one of the proteins that helps regulate this process. By understanding how SKAP2 helps protect against K . pneumoniae infections, researchers can develop better treatments and therapies to help people recover from these infections.
The study of the spread of parasites from person to person, such as with malaria, is well understood in theory. However, one type of malaria, Plasmodium vivax, has a unique feature that requires a different approach. This type of malaria has a reservoir of dormant liver-stage parasites called hypnozoites that can cause new infections weeks to months after the initial infection. The authors develop a mathematical model to understand the dynamics of this reservoir and how it affects the spread of the disease. They show that the reservoir of hypnozoites is over-dispersed, meaning that some people have many dormant parasites while others have none. This model is then integrated into a more comprehensive model of malaria spread to demonstrate how the hypnozoite reservoir affects the spread of the disease. The authors also discuss the implications of this model for controlling malaria, including the use of drugs to kill dormant parasites.
Scientists used 175 ha of permanent forest plots in the Amazon Basin to model post-logging carbon recovery. They found that net aboveground carbon recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and the west (21 ±3 Mg C ha-1) than in the south (12 ±3 Mg C ha-1) where environmental stress is high. The study suggests that forest recovery after logging may be higher in areas with lower rainfall and higher seasonality.
Neural stem cells (NSCs) exist in the adult brain, but it is unclear how they are related to neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs), which are commonly used as a surrogate for NSC function. A team of scientists has now identified and isolated two types of NSCs from the adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ): GEPCOT and pre-GEPCOT cells. The pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent and expressed higher levels of Glast and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2. They could not form neurospheres, expressed the stem cell markers Slc1a3-CreERT, GFAP-CreERT2, Sox2CreERT2, and Gli1CreERT2, and were long-lived in vivo. In contrast, GEPCOT cells were highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo, expressed higher levels of EGFR and PlexinB2, and were able to form neurospheres. GEPCOT cells were ablated by temozolomide, while pre-GEPCOT cells survived and repopulated the SVZ. Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, though pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent upon Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a (p16Ink4a) repression. The scientists' data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo.
The study investigates the spatial distribution and functional interactions of mechanically activated Piezo1 ion channels in cells. The results of cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation show that the density of Piezo1 channels does not affect their sensitivity to pressure or their open probability. The study suggests that Piezo1 channels may function independently, allowing for more efficient and homogeneous force detection across the cell membrane.
A new study has found that adding noise to visual cortex neurons while a monkey or human is making a decision can lead to faster decisions, higher confidence, and reduced accuracy. This study used a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex. The authors verified the manipulation with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. For both humans and monkeys, increasing the noise led to faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The findings suggest that decisions arise via the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound, which is consistent with the predictions of bounded evidence accumulation models. The study provides a new tool for testing the predictions of these models and could lead to a better understanding of how decisions are made.
The insulin-like signaling pathway in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans controls lifespan by inactivating the DAF-16 transcription factor. DAF-16 is phosphorylated by the AKT kinase, which prevents it from entering the nucleus. Calcineurin, a calcium-dependent protein phosphatase, also inactivates DAF-16, but the mechanism is unknown. In this study, the authors found that Calcineurin and a kinase called UNC-43 both regulate DAF-16 by phosphorylating it, but at different sites. Calcineurin removes the phosphorylation that inactivates DAF-16, while UNC-43 adds the phosphorylation that activates it. The authors also discovered that UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to various stress conditions, such as heat, starvation, and oxidative stress. This regulation occurs independently of the insulin-like signaling pathway and contributes to the overall regulation of lifespan. The authors also found that this regulation of FOXO by CAMKII and Calcineurin is conserved in mammalian cells.
Scientists have used a new approach to study how animals groom themselves. They studied how dirty fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements. The researchers used genetically targeted activation of neural subsets to drive distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. This allowed them to determine how these motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy. This work reveals how the organization of Drosophila grooming is well described by a parallel model of serial behavior.
In this study, researchers investigate the role of the protein Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) in chromosome segregation during meiosis. Meiosis is a complex process that involves the division of germ cells and the formation of haploid gametes (sperm and eggs). The study found that Sgol2 is involved in several key processes during meiosis, including turning off the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, facilitating the formation of kinetochore microtubules (K-fibers), and limiting bivalent stretching. The study also found that Sgol2's ability to perform these functions depends on its ability to bind to multiple other proteins, including PP2A, Mad2, MCAK, and Aurora C kinase. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex process of meiosis and highlights the importance of Sgol2 in coordinating multiple key processes during this process.
The paper explains how the brain's connections can change over time. These changes occur due to new RNA and protein synthesis. The study examined how RNAs and proteins are delivered from the nucleus to the synapse during synapse formation and plasticity. The study used Aplysia, a type of sea slug, to investigate this process. The study found that RNAs and proteins were delivered throughout the neuron, but that they were most concentrated at the synapse. This suggests that RNA localization is not as important as previously thought. Instead, the study found that a protein called DCC controls the localization of RNA and proteins at the synapse. The study suggests that the brain has a way to control which RNAs and proteins are made in a specific location, which may be important for learning and memory.
In this study, the authors explored how physical manipulation of cells can lead to controlled self-organization and pattern formation. They used an inducible CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension. By creating mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and then inducing mosaic knockdown (KD), the authors were able to interrogate how the creation of physical asymmetries in an otherwise homogeneous population leads to multicellular organization and pattern formation. They found that induction of mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in a ‘bottom-up’ cell-driven pattern formation of hiPSC colonies while preserving pluripotency. This study demonstrates the potential of CRISPRi systems to be used in the study of cell organization and pattern formation in vitro.
The amount of information that people can remember at one time decreases as the number of items they need to remember increases. In this article, the authors propose a theory that explains this phenomenon. They say that our brains try to balance two things when encoding information: the cost of making mistakes and the cost of using more brain power to remember more items. The authors construct a model from this theory and find that it can predict how people's memory performance changes as the number of items they need to remember increases. The authors also find that this theory can explain how the probability of being asked to remember an item affects how well people remember it. The authors find that their model can explain how people's memory performance changes under different conditions and they provide support for the idea that sometimes it is best to remember only a few or none of the relevant items in a task. The authors say that their findings suggest that "cognitive limitations" can sometimes be the result of rational decision-making rather than limitations of the brain.
Plants use a catabolic process called autophagy to clear unwanted components from their cells. This process is regulated by a group of proteins known as ATG proteins. Certain proteins called cargo receptors can recognize specific substances and bind them to autophagosomes, which are small bubbles that help the components to be degraded. Selective autophagy allows plants to target specific unwanted components and remove them. The mechanisms behind this process are not well understood. The plant pathogen P. infestans, which causes potato blight, has a protein called PexRD54 that interferes with the plant's autophagy process by binding to host autophagy protein ATG8CL to stimulate autophagosome formation. This protein also depletes a cargo receptor called Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes to counteract the plant's defenses against P. infestans. This shows that P. infestans can use its own proteins to disrupt the plant's autophagy process and gain an advantage in the infection.
The study examines the response of human primary cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to various combinations of environmental stimuli. The CFs were stimulated with mechanical strain and controlled oxygen levels, simulating the loss of contractility and oxygen reduction that occur in cardiac tissue during ischemia. The results showed that the combination of hypoxia and mechanical strain led to increased proliferation, inflammatory cytokine release, and matrix metalloproteinase expression in the CFs. The study provides insight into the early cellular responses that occur during ischemia and could inform the development of effective anti-fibrotic therapies.
The paper is about histone acetylation and the incorporation of the H2A variant H2A.Z in Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly. The researchers have found that the gene DOMINO, which codes for a complex of proteins involved in histone acetylation and the incorporation of H2A.Z, has two variants. These variants create two distinct complexes. The DOM-A complex is an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase, similar to the yeast NuA4, and targets H4K12, while the DOM-B complex is an ATP-dependent H2A.Z incorporator, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. The paper highlights the utility of alternative splicing to generate functional diversity in chromatin regulators.
The paper explores the functions of the protein β-catenin (Ctnnb1) in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation. Researchers have found that Ctnnb1 is critical for motoneuron differentiation, but the relevant retrograde signal from the muscle to the motoneuron is not known. In this study, researchers used an in vivo transgenic approach to determine the functions of Ctnnb1 in NMJ formation. They found that the transcription regulation function of Ctnnb1 is necessary for NMJ formation, but the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 is dispensable. Researchers also screened for proteins that may serve as a Ctnnb1-directed retrograde factor and identified Slit2. Transgenic expression of Slit2 specifically in the muscle was able to rescue the presynaptic deficits caused by Ctnnb1 mutation in mice. This suggests that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation.
Scientists have developed a method that can measure the forces transmitted between individual cells within a tissue. This technique uses microscopy to track the movements of individual cells in real time and quantify the forces that they exert on each other. By analyzing these forces, the scientists were able to understand how cells communicate and coordinate with each other in response to various stimuli, such as wound healing or cell division. This new method provides a powerful tool for studying the complex interactions between cells in living tissues.
Huntingtin is a large protein that causes Huntington’s disease when its amino-terminal region contains a polyglutamine (Q) tract of more than 38 repeats. A study was done to investigate the structure and function of huntingtin and how the polyglutamine expansion changes these properties. The study found that huntingtin has a spherical α-helical solenoid structure and that the polyglutamine expansion increases the α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the interactions between different domains of the protein. This study provides insight into the structure of huntingtin and how the polyglutamine expansion affects its function, which could lead to a better understanding of the disease.
Iron is essential for most organisms and is stored in proteins called ferritin. The autophagy pathway is used to degrade ferritin, but it is not well understood how it is regulated. In this study, the researchers identified NCOA4 as a selective cargo receptor that targets ferritin to the autophagosome. They also found that HERC2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is an NCOA4-interacting protein and that NCOA4 levels are regulated by HERC2 and the ubiquitin proteasome system. Finally, the study found that NCOA4 plays an important role in erythropoiesis, the process by which red blood cells are produced, in zebrafish and cultured cells. Overall, this study provides a deeper understanding of the ferritinophagy pathway and its role in regulating iron metabolism.
Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study how the brain processes information and controls behavior. They focused on the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), a part of the brain important for goal-directed cognition. The researchers found that the rostral (front) and caudal (back) parts of the LPFC process and represent increasingly abstract information to facilitate efficient and flexible cognition. They also found that the mid-LPFC, rather than the rostral-most areas, was positioned at the apex of the hierarchy, integrating abstract and concrete information to control behavior. The researchers concluded that the LPFC is hierarchically organized and that the mid-LPFC plays a critical role in integrating information to control behavior.
The authors explore the role of the gene TBC1D3 in brain development in mice. TBC1D3 is a hominoid-specific gene that undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution. The authors found that expressing TBC1D3 in mice caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells and promoted the generation of basal progenitors. They also found that down-regulating TBC1D3 decreased the generation of basal progenitors in cultured human brain slices. Interestingly, the authors discovered that localized oRG proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3 was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. These findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of the mammalian neocortex.
In order to understand how plants defend themselves against pathogens, we need to understand the process of systemic acquired resistance. This process is regulated by a protein called NPR1, which is a transcriptional coactivator. To become active, NPR1 must undergo a process called ubiquitination, in which proteins are tagged with a protein called ubiquitin. This tag allows the proteasome, a large protein complex, to degrade the protein. However, we found that NPR1 is not degraded immediately after ubiquitination. Instead, it is first modified by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase, which helps NPR1 enter the nucleus and bind to target genes. Once NPR1 has bound to target genes, it is then degraded by the 26S proteasome. This process helps to regulate the timing and intensity of the immune response in plants.
Scientists have discovered that a certain type of small RNA called 24 nt siRNA is responsible for silencing various types of RNA in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana . These 24 nt siRNAs are made in a process that involves several proteins, including nuclear RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ), and DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ). However, the source of these siRNA precursors has been unknown. The scientists found that Pol IV and RDR2 produce a type of RNA called P4R2 RNA, which are mostly between 26 and 45 nucleotides long and start with a purine next to a pyrimidine. The 24 nt siRNAs are made by cutting P4R2 RNAs at either end by DCL3. This discovery helps scientists understand how these 24 nt siRNAs are made and could lead to new ways to silence certain RNAs in plants.
This study looked at how neural networks in the brain change as we grow from babies to adults. The researchers used a technique called in vivo electrophysiology to record the brain activity of immature mice and humans. They found that in mice, neural networks start to work more like they do in adults after a period of relative "quiet" time. During this period, neurons start to communicate more effectively and work together to create patterns of brain activity. In humans, the researchers found a similar pattern of development, with a period of relative "quiet" time followed by the emergence of more complex and coordinated brain activity. The researchers believe that this period of relative "quiet" time is necessary for the brain to develop the ability to work together effectively.
The article by Ayala and Tibayrenc (2002) presented a theoretical model of the dynamics of pathogen strains that undergo sexual recombination and compete for hosts due to immune selection. In this model, each parasite has a unique set of antigenic proteins, which allows for clonal antigenic variation. The authors showed that, even when antigenic variation is driven by several unlinked genes that undergo recombination, immune selection can lead to the maintenance of discrete, non-overlapping antigenic repertoires. The article discusses the implications of these findings for the control of pathogen populations, as well as the challenges of testing these theories empirically.
In this study, researchers found that a bacterial protein called OspI inhibits the immune response of a human host cell by deamidating a protein called UBC13. UBC13 is an essential part of the immune response, but deamidation weakens its ability to work with another protein called TRAF6. The researchers used NMR spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and in-vitro ubiquitination assays to study the effects of deamidation on the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6. They discovered that deamidation disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 by three mechanisms: a new intramolecular salt-bridge, salt-bridge competition, and transient repulsion. This study highlights that post-translational modifications can effectively modulate the interaction between proteins by perturbing transient intermolecular contacts.
In this study, the authors manipulated interneurons in the auditory cortex of awake mice while recording neural responses to tones. They found that inactivating Sst+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivating Pvalb+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer. However, when they activated these interneurons, they found no such differences. The authors used a simple model to understand this asymmetry and found that small changes in key parameters, such as baseline activity or the strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent conclusions regarding interneurons' computational functions. This suggests that minor experimental details can change the readout of a neural population's role in computation and that conclusions drawn regarding neuronal function can be influenced even distorted by the precise way in which the neuronal populations are manipulated.
The study used transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tACS ) to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports working memory ( WM ). Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high . The study found that synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity and functional connectivity within the WM network . The study demonstrated a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization.
The article discusses how embryonic polarity, or the orientation of the body axes in developing embryos, is determined. In most invertebrates and amphibians, embryonic polarity is determined by maternal determinants that fix cell fates early in development. In contrast, amniote embryos, such as birds and mammals, remain plastic until gastrulation, the stage at which the primitive streak forms. To determine the polarity of amniote embryos, a new study has identified the transcription factor Pitx2 as a direct regulator of the gene cVg1, which encodes a Nodal/Activin-type molecule that signals through Smad2/3. Pitx2 is essential for axis formation and is expressed in the posterior marginal zone of the embryo before gastrulation. The article concludes that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.
The Drosophila fly has a sophisticated ability to detect and respond to temporal variation of olfactory stimuli. In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process this temporal information, flies were exposed to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs) were recorded. It was found that PN output strongly signaled the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output. This suggests that PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.
Seed development in flowering plants involves the fusion of two male sperm cells and two female egg cells, leading to the formation of the embryo and the endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by a maternal seed coat. The development of the seed coat is blocked by epigenetic regulators before fertilization, and this block is removed following fertilization. Auxin, a plant hormone, plays a crucial role in seed coat development. In this study, we found that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin, which is likely transported to the maternal tissues to remove the PcG block on seed coat development. We also identified a MADS-box transcription factor, AGL62, which regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development. This study highlights the crucial role of auxin and AGL62 in seed coat development.
The article presents a study that aims to understand how the receptor binding protein (RBP) of the T7 phage interacts with its host. The T7 phage is a bacteriophage that infects and kills Escherichia coli. The study involved mutating every single amino acid in the tip domain of the T7 phage RBP and assessing the functional role of each mutation on multiple bacterial hosts. The study found that certain regions of the tip domain were more important for the phage's ability to infect different hosts and also identified specific mutations that made the phage more effective at killing its host. The study also identified mutations that allowed the phage to infect resistant hosts and mutations that eliminated specific hosts. The study used a high-throughput, locus-specific phage engineering method to generate and analyze the mutations. The method, called ORACLE, is a generalized framework that can be used to characterize the sequence-function relationships in many phage-bacterial systems. The study provides important insights into the molecular basis of the interaction between the T7 phage and its host. It also demonstrates the therapeutic potential of phages and provides a generalized approach for engineering phages to kill bacteria.
The study investigates the relationship between the neural basis of pitch processing and pitch perception in people with congenital amusia, a rare condition characterized by a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing. The study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the neural processing of spoken sentences with different pitch and duration cues in people with amusia and non-amusic controls. Functional connectivity between language regions and pitch-related regions is examined using a data-driven approach to identify the largest group differences, and the cue weights of different pitch and duration cues are compared between the groups. The results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions and suggest a compensatory mechanism.
The Tasmanian devil is a unique mammal that has two contagious cancers, Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1) and Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2). DFT1 cells have MHC class I molecules, but they are not expressed well enough to be recognized by the host immune system. DFT2 cells, on the other hand, have MHC class I molecules that are commonly found in the Tasmanian devil population, making them less likely to be rejected by the host immune system. DFT2 is a new cancer that is emerging in the Tasmanian devil population, and it may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1. This study highlights the importance of understanding the immune response of cancer cells in order to better understand and treat contagious cancers.
Researchers used optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to reveal that the granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) receives distinct types of inputs from different parts of the brain. Anterior thalamus, dorsal subiculum, and claustrum provide input to two different types of RSG cells, low-rheobase and regular-spiking neurons. These cells have different physiology, morphology, and computational capabilities. Thalamic inputs allow low-rheobase neurons to robustly encode angular speed, even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction. The researchers suggest that these results suggest that low-rheobase neurons are ideally positioned to contribute to the initial spatial orientation computations performed in superficial RSG .
Scientists have discovered that tauopathy, which is a form of brain damage that causes Alzheimer's disease, can spread to other parts of the brain after a traumatic brain injury. They used a special kind of zebrafish that can help them study this problem in more detail. This new zebrafish has been engineered to report when tau aggregates, which are clumps of misfolded proteins, appear in the brain. Scientists have also found that seizures, which often happen after a traumatic brain injury, can help the tau aggregates spread. By studying this process in more detail, scientists hope to find ways to stop tau aggregates from spreading and causing brain damage.
This paper investigates the relationship between brain connectivity and behaviour. The authors of the study suggest that the shape and exact location of brain regions can interact strongly with the measurement of brain connectivity. They provide evidence that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behaviour and lifestyle. They believe that a better understanding of these effects is important when interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits. In order to achieve this, the authors use data from the Human Connectome Project, a large-scale brain imaging project, and apply a group-level parcellation approach to obtain network matrices of edges. They then use a correlation-based approach to determine which key aspect of rfMRI data is uniquely associated with behaviour. The authors find that the spatial topography of functional regions across subjects is the primary driver of cross-subject trait variability in correlation-based FC measures obtained via group-level rfMRI parcellation approaches. They also provide evidence for systematic differences in the spatial organisation of functional regions and show how these differences can impact the measurement of brain connectivity. They use simulations to investigate whether these differences reflect meaningful cross-subject information and drive edge estimates for several common FC approaches.
The study proposed that the composition of the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC) is crucial for the activation of muscle-specific genes. It is known that TFIID, which includes TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), is responsible for recognizing core promoter sequences. The study suggests that during muscle differentiation, the canonical TFIID is replaced by a complex consisting of TBP2 (also known as TRF3) and TAF3. The authors further suggest that TBP2 plays a key role in promoting muscle-specific gene expression. However, TBP2 knockout mice did not show a skeletal muscle phenotype, suggesting that TBP2 is not essential for developmental myogenesis.
This study investigates how brain stimulation affects the connectivity and dynamics of large-scale neural networks. The authors used an optogenetic interface to stimulate populations of excitatory neurons in primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex while recording large-scale electrocorticographic (μ-ECoG) activity. They compared two measures of functional connectivity, the network response to focal stimulation and the baseline coherence between electrodes. They found that stimulation strengthened the gross functional connectivity between S1 and M1 within minutes, and at a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network. These changes reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. The authors concluded that their work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits and has significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.
This rare case of a Rhesus macaque (monkey S) born likely without primary visual cortex (V1) had normal social behavior, but impaired performance on visual tasks. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging, the authors found that visual stimulation activated the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar, which are part of the visual pathway outside of V1. The pulvinar was the main area of visual cortical activation in monkey S, but it was sparse. Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, little evidence was found for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena. The authors suggest that in the absence of V1, the pulvinar nucleus might serve as a relay station between the retina and the extrastriate visual cortex. They also mention that early-life V1 lesions may lead to less pruning of the retina-pulvinar-V5/MT pathway and contribute to 'blindsight'.
The ability of the human innate immune system to recognize and respond to foreign DNA in the nucleus is an important defense mechanism. However, the molecular mechanisms that allow for this recognition and response are not well understood. This study describes a mechanism by which a protein called IFI16 can detect foreign DNA and use it to form an assembly platform for inflammatory responses. The study found that IFI16 binds to exposed, foreign DNA and forms one-dimensional tracks along the DNA to find other IFI16 molecules to assemble with. The study also found that host DNA prevents IFI16 from forming these tracks, which allows IFI16 to specifically target foreign DNA without responding to host DNA. This finding helps explain how IFI16 can specifically target foreign DNA and initiate inflammatory responses without causing autoimmunity.
Spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ) is a novel technique that uses fluorescent dyes or antibodies to stain regions of interest ( ROIs ) in mammalian tissue, then soaks these regions in solutions containing photo-labels that can covalently bind to all proteins within the specified ROI. This technique can be applied to various biological samples, including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue. The method allows for spatial analysis of protein composition with high resolution, making it useful for identifying the composition of irregularly shaped structures such as amyloid plaques, inclusion bodies, and fibers. It can also be used to identify protein components that are associated with soluble features within the tissue sample. This technique has been used to identify novel protein components of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease brain tissue, confirm known plaque constituents, and identify proteins that are associated with soluble features within the tissue sample.
The article discusses the importance of the Frizzled3 (Fz3) gene in the development of motor nerves. The Fz3 gene is responsible for the growth of motor axons to their targets. Loss of the Fz3 gene leads to axonal stalling at a specific location in the nerve plexus. This stalling defect is distinct from phenotypes produced by defects in other signaling systems. The affected motor neurons die shortly after their axons stall, providing in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule.
Transposable elements (TEs), which are similar to viruses, have the ability to move from one location to another within the genome. It is thought that TEs have helped to establish gene regulatory networks, but there is little evidence that they play a significant role in gene regulation. A recent study tested a set of long terminal repeat TE families for roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells and trophoblast stem cells. Epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a large number of TEs helped to establish tissue-specific gene expression programmes. Genetic editing of individual TEs confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships. However, a wider survey via CRISPR interference of RLTR13D6 elements in embryonic stem cells revealed that only a minority play a significant role in gene regulation. This study highlights the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene regulatory roles of TEs.
This paper is about the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and how it has developed into the complex and highly productive process that it is today. Researchers have found that there are four major trajectories of evolution for C4 photosynthesis, and that the development of this process is flexible and not fixed. The authors used a variety of methods, including meta-analysis and a hidden Markov model, to understand the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and how it has changed over time. They found that different lineages of C4 plants have evolved in different ways, and that there is a lot of diversity in how this complex process has developed. Overall, this paper provides valuable insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and the flexibility that has allowed it to adapt and survive in different environments.
Bacterial cytoskeletal proteins that build and maintain the structure of a cell's outer layer, such as the cell wall, have evolved to polymerize using the energy released from hydrolyzing ATP instead of GTP. This is different from the energy-consuming proteins, such as motors, that have evolved to use the energy released from GTP hydrolysis to perform work. The protein SpoIVA is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation. SpoIVA was thought to have switched its nucleotide preference from GTP to ATP because of increased ATP availability relative to GTP at the end of sporulation. To test this idea, we engineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity by restoring the NKxD motif and altering the SxE sequence in the loop associated with the G5 motif. We found that the altered SpoIVA was able to polymerize specifically in the presence of ATP or GTP but failed to do so efficiently in the presence of GTP. We also found that SpoIVA formed an ADP-bound intermediate, which was required for polymerization, in the presence of ATP but not GTP. We then engineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of Era, another protein from the TRAFAC group, to mimic its ancestral ATPase activity by introducing the SxE sequence and disrupting the NKxD motif. We found that the altered Era was able to polymerize specifically in the presence of ATP and not GTP. We propose that the evolution of SpoIVA's ATPase activity was driven by increased ATP availability relative to GTP at the end of sporulation, which led to the formation of the ADP-dependent intermediate required for polymerization.
Leptin is a hormone that helps the brain regulate energy balance. It tells the brain how much energy is stored in the body and how much energy is being used. However, we don't know much about how important leptin is during development. To find out, scientists took mice that don't have the gene for the leptin receptor (LepR) and fixed it either in the fourth or tenth week of life. They found that some problems caused by not having leptin signaling in the first weeks of life could be fixed by fixing the LepR later in life. But other problems, like not being able to regulate energy balance properly and problems with the reproductive system and brain growth, were permanent. This suggests that leptin is important for development, and problems with leptin signaling during development can cause permanent problems.
Scientists have discovered that a certain kind of protein, called XLG2, helps plants fight off bacteria. XLG2 works together with other proteins called AGB1 and AGG1/2 to recognize when bacteria are attacking and trigger the plant's defense system. This discovery could help us better understand how plants defend themselves against harmful microbes.
The Arabidopsis circadian clock regulates gene activity throughout the day and night in plants, but it is unclear how it is coordinated across the plant. In this study, researchers observed clock activity at the single cell level across Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions. They found that clock oscillations were not synchronized and that clock periods varied across the plant. In addition, they observed two waves of clock activity, one down and one up the root, and found evidence of cell-to-cell coupling, especially in the root tip. A simple model suggested that their observed period differences, plus cell-to-cell coupling, could generate the observed waves in clock gene expression. This study reveals the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggests that unlike the centralized mammalian clock, the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points.
In social situations, we hear different people talking at the same time. Our brains can usually separate the sound of the person we want to hear from the other sounds. However, sometimes this can be difficult, especially for people with hearing loss. Researchers have found that this problem is often caused by a lack of information in the sounds we hear, which makes it harder for the brain to understand what we are hearing. They have found that this information can be found in how the sound changes over time. The researchers found that a combination of fast processing in the brain, the amount of effort needed to listen, and how well people could hear low-frequency sounds, could predict how well people with normal hearing could understand what people were saying in a noisy environment. This information could help doctors design better tests to find hidden hearing problems.
In this paper, we describe the development of an ultrafast adaptive optics imaging system that can measure the blood flow velocity of single red blood cells (RBCs) in the full range of retinal vessel sizes in a living mouse, without requiring surgery or contrast dye. The system measures the speed of each RBC by tracking the motion of a 15 kHz ultrasound wavefront reflected off the blood cell. By measuring the velocity of hundreds of thousands of RBCs flowing in each vessel, we can compute the mean velocity and flow rate of blood in capillaries, medium and large vessels, and the entire retinal vascular system. Our system can measure pulsatile blood flow and single-cell flux in capillaries, which allows us to study the heterogeneity of flow dynamics within a microvascular bed. We report that there is a marked difference in the velocity distribution among different generations of vessels, and that diameter alone is not a good predictor of microcirculation hemodynamics. Our system has the potential to noninvasively study microvascular integrity and kinetics in a portion of the living brain, by leveraging the central nervous system origin of the retina. This provides a powerful tool for studying diseases of the retina and brain, as well as the microvascular system more broadly.
Scientists have discovered that the receptor-like kinase gene SYMRK is important for the development of two different types of symbiosis: arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. They found that overexpression of SYMRK led to spontaneous nodulation and nodule organogenesis (growth of nodules) without the presence of rhizobia, bacteria that help plants get nutrients from the soil. They also found that SYMRK played a key role in deciding between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development.
DeepLabCut is a popular software tool for automatically measuring animal behavior using computer vision. This paper presents DeepLabCut 2.0, which is an extension of the original DeepLabCut software that provides several new features and improvements. These improvements include faster processing speed, more accurate pose estimation, and the ability to track multiple individuals in a video. The paper also describes a new tool called PeakPicker, which is used to improve the accuracy of pose estimation by selecting the highest confidence keypoints from the output of the DeepLabCut model. Additionally, the paper provides a new method for tracking multiple individuals in a video called multi-object tracking, which is accomplished by linking the keypoints of an individual across multiple frames. The paper compares the performance of DeepLabCut 2.0 to other state-of-the-art software tools for animal pose estimation and tracking, and shows that DeepLabCut 2.0 outperforms these tools in several ways. The paper also provides examples of how DeepLabCut 2.0 can be used to analyze animal behavior in laboratory and field settings, and demonstrates how the software can be used to answer a variety of research questions in neuroscience, behavioral ecology, and other fields. Overall, this paper provides a valuable resource for researchers who are interested in using computer vision to measure animal behavior.
Inflammation is a necessary part of our body's immune response to protect us from infection, injury, and stress. However, if inflammation becomes excessive, it can be damaging. Innate immune cells, like macrophages, have sensors that can detect when there is a problem and activate an immune response. These sensors, called NLRs, can be activated by pathogens or other signals that disrupt our cell's normal metabolism. When NLRs are activated, they trigger inflammasomes, which can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a form of cell death called pyroptosis. A new study has found that a drop in NADH levels and an increase in mitochondrial ROS production are responsible for triggering inflammasomes, IL-1β production, and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. This signal is also important for the host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. The study reveals that disruption of cellular metabolism can trigger inflammation, which can be useful information for researchers and doctors studying inflammatory diseases.
This study identifies a major DNA-binding site of the PALB2 protein and demonstrates its critical role in chromosome repair. PALB2 is a protein that helps repair DNA damage caused by radiation or chemicals. It is important for preventing cancer and other genetic disorders. Researchers have found that a specific region of PALB2 called N-DBD is responsible for binding DNA. Mutations in this region reduce the ability of PALB2 to help repair DNA damage and increase the risk of genetic disorders. In addition, N-DBD can stimulate the activity of another protein called RAD51, which is important for repairing DNA damage. This study provides important insights into how PALB2 helps repair DNA damage and highlights the importance of this protein for maintaining genetic integrity.
This study examined the structure and function of MreB, a protein found in prokaryotic cells that is responsible for maintaining cell shape. Previous research has shown that MreB forms parallel pairs of protofilaments that play a crucial role in cell shape. However, the study found that MreB from Caulobacter forms pairs of antiparallel protofilaments instead. This discovery was made through the analysis of crystal structures of Caulobacter MreB. The study also used cryo-electron microscopy to show that pairs of protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB tightly bind to membranes. The study also used in vivo cross-linking to show that protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB are oriented in an antiparallel fashion. Additionally, the study found that A22 and MP265, two antimicrobial agents, bind to Caulobacter MreB and prevent nucleotide hydrolysis, which destabilizes double protofilaments. Overall, this study provides important insights into the structure and function of MreB and its role in cell shape maintenance.
Petal number varies in different flowering plants, but it is usually fixed within a species. In Arabidopsis thaliana, for example, four petals are always found in a flower, but in Cardamine hirsuta, the number of petals can be zero to four. The genetic basis for this difference between species is unknown. In this study, the authors found that AP1, a floral regulator gene, is responsible for this species-specific difference in petal number robustness. They found that AP1 from A. thaliana can mask the phenotypic expression of all petal number QTL in C. hirsuta, conferring robustness. This effect is explained by epistatic interactions, where C. hirsuta AP1 fails to complement the function of A. thaliana AP1, resulting in variable petal number. The authors also found that upstream regulatory regions of AP1 contribute to this divergence.
The article is about the process of making insulin and how changes in this process can lead to diabetes. Insulin is made from a protein called proinsulin, which is stored in the cells until it is needed. The first step in making insulin is called folding. During folding, certain parts of the protein stick together. However, some of the proteins may not fold correctly. This can cause problems with how the insulin works. The article discusses how genetic changes can cause problems with folding. It also talks about how changes in the body that are not caused by genetic changes can also affect how insulin is made. The article concludes that there are ways to identify when insulin is being made incorrectly and that this can help prevent or treat diabetes.
Scientists have found that SUV39H, a molecule that helps organize DNA in a way that keeps it silent, binds to nucleic acids. This binding is important for its function in organizing DNA. SUV39H prefers to bind to RNA over DNA, and this binding is not affected by its ability to recognize a specific type of chemical modification of DNA. SUV39H also binds to RNA in vivo, and when RNA levels are reduced, SUV39H's binding to DNA is reduced. These findings suggest that RNA plays a role in organizing DNA by helping to target SUV39H to specific regions.
Spatial representations, such as place cells and grid cells, have been discovered in many species, including rodents, bats, monkeys, and humans. In previous research, grid cells in the hippocampus of monkeys were not observed. However, grid cells have been found to support cognitive functions beyond spatial navigation. Recent studies have shown that grid cells are active during the exploration of images with eye-movements, also known as overt attention. This suggests that grid cells can represent not only location in space but also gaze position or locus of attention. Here, we aimed to investigate whether firing fields of entorhinal cells are activated by movements of covert attention, in the absence of any physical movement. We found that a significant population of entorhinal cells with spatially structured receptive fields was identified in monkeys trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a stimulus moving in the periphery. This contrasted with the hippocampus, where grid-like representations were not observed. Our findings provide evidence that neurons in the macaque entorhinal cortex do not rely on physical movement and support the hypothesis that grid cells participate in a range of cognitive functions.
Scientists have successfully developed a standardized method for testing how mice make decisions. This method involves a task that requires mice to detect a visual stimulus and choose its location by making a simple movement. The scientists trained 140 mice in this task across seven laboratories in three countries and collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. They found that despite differences in labs and individual mice, most learned the task, and after learning, their behavior was similar. Mice in different labs relied on the same factors, such as visual stimuli, past successes and failures, and estimates of stimulus prior probability, to guide their choices. The scientists released all the hardware and software components and the experimental protocols to promote reproducibility and facilitate the use of the task in future studies.
In this study, the authors used laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA-sequencing to analyze the intestinal transcriptome of a planarian flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea. They identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression that were not detected by previous approaches. They also found that the planarian intestine has extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. In addition, they discovered previously unappreciated regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, especially among intestinal goblet cells. Finally, they identified two intestine-enriched transcription factors that specifically regulate regeneration (hedgehog signaling effector gli-1) or maintenance (RREB2) of goblet cells. Overall, this work provides resources for further investigation of mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration.
This study investigates how different sensory coding mechanisms have evolved in mormyrid fish. Some mormyrid species have receptors that fire a single spike in response to an electric pulse, while others have receptors that produce spontaneously oscillating potentials. The study found that the oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in a transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. These receptors are most sensitive to frequencies found only in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics and this was correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. The study provides the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony.
A new 3.5 Å resolution structure of the head of a whooping cough-causing bacteriophage (BPP-1) has been determined using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure shows the head of BPP-1 has a jellyroll-like shape for its cement protein (CP) and a HK97-like shape for its major capsid protein (MCP). A new non-circularly permuted topology of MCP from the HK97 topology is found. The β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1. The termini of both CP and MCP are positioned to display DGR-diversified peptide libraries for protein engineering applications.
The study aimed to examine how the Dengue virus (DENV) adapts to different environments (mosquitoes and humans) by using deep sequencing and ultra-deep sequencing. The researchers found that there is a balance between the selection of rare beneficial mutations and the constant replenishment of deleterious mutations. Beneficial mutations were found to be clustered in specific regions of the virus genome and enriched in flexible regions of the viral proteome. The study provides insights into the evolution of flaviviruses and highlights similarities between long- and short-term evolutionary scales.
Membrane nanodomains have been linked to Ras signaling, but their role in Ras movement and behavior is not yet clear. Here, researchers used single particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) to analyze the movement of KRasG12D (a mutant of the KRas protein) in U2OS cells. They found that KRasG12D moves in three different ways: fast, slow, and immobile. The fast and immobile states were previously known, but the slow state was new. The researchers also discovered that KRasG12D moves from the fast state to the slow state in a way that resembles Ras internalization and recycling. They conclude that membrane nanodomains play a key role in Ras movement and behavior, and that the behavior of KRasG12D in these nanodomains may be important for signaling.
In this article, the authors use a mathematical model and imaging techniques to study how Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling is graded along the dorsal-ventral (DV) axis of a zebrafish embryo. They found that rather than working as a shuttle between the source of the BMP signal (at the dorsal pole of the embryo) and the sink of the BMP signal (at the ventral pole), Chordin (a BMP antagonist) is important for creating the steep gradient of BMP signaling activity that is necessary for proper DV patterning. This result challenges a previous model of how BMP signaling gradients are formed and has important implications for our understanding of how tissues and organs are patterned during development.
Lysosomes are important organelles inside cells that help break down molecules from within the cell or from outside the cell. Lysosomes do this using enzymes that break down molecules into smaller parts. The enzymes that break down the molecules are often transported to the lysosomes by proteins that help move them across cell membranes. Some of these proteins are not well understood and are the focus of this study. The study looked at a protein called MFSD1 that is thought to be important for the function of lysosomes. MFSD1 is a protein that is part of a larger group of proteins called the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). MFS proteins are involved in moving molecules across cell membranes. MFSD1 is thought to be involved in moving molecules from outside the cell to the inside of lysosomes. MFSD1 also interacts with a protein called GLMP, which is also thought to be important for the function of lysosomes. Together, MFSD1 and GLMP are thought to form a complex that helps move molecules from outside the cell to the inside of lysosomes. This process is important for the function of lysosomes.
In a recent study, the authors obtained crystal structures of kinesin monomers bound to microtubules, allowing them to observe the mechanistic scheme of microtubule attachment, nucleotide binding, and translocation. The study is significant because it sheds light on the structure and function of the kinesin motor protein, which is important for cellular processes such as mitosis and neuronal transport. Additionally, the study contributes to the understanding of the interactions between kinesin and microtubules, which are crucial for proper cellular functioning. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms of molecular motors and their role in cellular biology.
In a study published in the journal Molecular Cell, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, used yeast as a model organism to identify new components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) that degrade misfolded mitochondrial proteins. The researchers found that temperature-sensitive (ts) peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane proteins were degraded by the UPS through a process called mitochondria-associated degradation (MAD). Mitochondria are double-membrane organelles that produce energy through the breakdown of glucose and oxygen. When proteins within the mitochondria become misfolded, they can interfere with the organelle's function and cause cellular damage. The UPS helps to clear misfolded proteins from the mitochondria and prevent their accumulation. The researchers found that MAD is a distinct quality control (QC) pathway that requires the involvement of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors. The findings of this study provide new insights into the process of mitochondrial QC and could help inform future research on the development of therapies for mitochondrial diseases.
The study aimed to understand how growth signals are controlled in living skin by examining a protein called extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). The authors used a special type of mouse to visualize ERK activity in the skin and discovered a new phenomenon called Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution (SPREAD). In SPREAD, ERK activation spreads from one cell to the next in a radial wave, and this wave propagates up to 50 microns with an average velocity of 1.5 microns per minute. The frequency of SPREAD is associated with the rate of cell division. SPREADs were stimulated by applying a chemical compound that induces cell division. The authors also found that SPREAD is essential for the progression of the cell cycle. SPREADs were more abundant in cells that were in the S/G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The authors also visualized ERK activity in wounded skin, which revealed a different type of ERK activation propagation pattern. This new pattern was called the Wound-induced ERK Activation Propagation (WHEAP) pattern. In WHEAP, ERK activation also spreads in a radial wave, but this wave travels parallel to the wound edge, and it is maintained during propagation. The study provides new insights into how growth signals are controlled in living skin.
The circadian rhythm of a bacterium called Synechococcus elongatus has been studied in a laboratory setting. It has been observed that the circadian rhythm scales linearly with day length, meaning that the phase of the rhythm shifts by a constant amount per hour of daylight. This behavior has been observed in both laboratory experiments and in a mathematical model. The model predicts that the circadian rhythm will track midday when day length varies. The model can also be used to predict the phase response of the rhythm to sudden changes in daylight. The mathematical model provides insight into the mechanisms by which the circadian rhythm adapts to changing day lengths.
The study aims to understand why sudden cardiac death (SCD) occurs in many people. It has been shown that Meis1, a gene identified by genome-wide association studies, is a risk factor for SCD. The study reports that Meis1 inactivation in mouse neural crest cells leads to an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions in adults, resulting in increased susceptibility to SCD. It has also been shown that Meis1 regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery, such as Rab5, which is crucial for endosomal trafficking. The study highlights the importance of Meis1 in sympathetic neurons differentiation by its role in target-field innervation. Finally, it is suggested that Meis1 plays a crucial role in the transport of early endosomes and is necessary for sympathetic target-field innervation.
In this study, researchers have shown that bacterial biofilms undergo a process called "mechanomorphogenesis" when they grow on a surface. This involves a change in shape from a flat film to a wrinkled one and then to a partially detached film. This process occurs due to a mismatch in growth rates between the film and the surface it is attached to, which creates mechanical instabilities. These instabilities are caused by the generation and annihilation of interfaces between the film and the surface. The researchers discovered this process using Vibrio cholerae as a model system and combined several techniques, including mechanical measurements, image analysis, and genetic analysis. They believe that this process may also be relevant to the development of tissues in higher organisms.
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. The mechanisms underlying the development of epileptic neuronal networks after injury such as severe seizures are unknown. The authors of this study used a mouse model to study how NRSF, an important transcription factor that influences neuronal function, is involved in the development of epilepsy. They found that NRSF levels in mature hippocampal neurons increased several-fold after epilepsy-provoking seizures. However, only a subset of potential NRSF target genes were repressed by NRSF after seizures. Furthermore, these repressed genes were rescued when NRSF binding to chromatin was blocked. The authors found that the repressed gene set was involved in ion channel, receptor, and calcium-related functions, suggesting that their repression might contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.
The olfactory bulb of mammals has two types of neurons, mitral cells and tufted cells, that process olfactory information. These neurons are wired up into parallel pathways, meaning they process different aspects of the same information. However, how these two types of neurons process information differently is not well understood. Recent research has shown that mitral cells and tufted cells respond differently to odor concentrations, and they project their axons to different parts of the brain. Additionally, tufted cells are more excitable than mitral cells, and they receive stronger input from the olfactory receptors. It is not known if other parts of the olfactory circuit contribute to these differences in how mitral cells and tufted cells process information. Lateral inhibition is a type of circuit-level regulation in the olfactory bulb that helps to differentiate between similar stimuli. This regulation occurs between pairs of neurons, and it decorrelates the responses of these neurons to similar input. Previous research has shown that this lateral inhibition affects mitral cells better than tufted cells, but the reasons for this difference were not known. In this study, researchers used optogenetic tools to stimulate a single glomerulus in the olfactory bulb, and they found that this stimulation created larger and more asynchronous lateral inhibitory currents in nearby mitral cells than in tufted cells. Additionally, they found that the effect of lateral inhibition was different in mitral cells and tufted cells. Mitral cells were affected at intermediate firing rates, while tufted cells were affected at low firing rates. This difference was due to the fact that tufted cells recruit different types of inhibitory neurons than mitral cells. Finally, the researchers used computer simulations to explore how these differences in how mitral cells and tufted cells process information could affect odor discrimination. They found that the combination of these two types of neurons could allow for better odor discrimination than either type of neuron alone.
The M2 muscarinic receptor is an important member of a family of proteins called G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These proteins play a vital role in the body's communication system, helping cells to communicate with each other and carry out various functions. The M2 muscarinic receptor is responsible for several important functions, including regulation of heart rate and blood pressure. It has been widely studied for many years due to its importance and because of its unique ability to interact with other proteins called allosteric ligands. These interactions can either enhance or inhibit the M2 receptor's ability to carry out its functions, making it an attractive target for developing new treatments for various diseases. However, the exact mechanism behind these interactions is still not fully understood.
The article describes the role of SETD2, a protein that modifies the structure of DNA in the body, in repairing DNA damage. SETD2 helps cells repair DNA damage by marking the location of the damage and promoting the formation of a protein called RAD51, which is important for repairing DNA. Loss of SETD2 may lead to ineffective repair of DNA damage, which can increase the risk of cancer and other diseases caused by mutations in DNA.
This study describes a new mouse model of autoimmune disease caused by a mutation in the Rasgrp1 gene. Rasgrp1 is a protein that helps regulate the development of immune cells called T lymphocytes. The Rasgrp1Anaef mutation causes a change in a specific part of the Rasgrp1 protein, which affects its ability to regulate T cell development in the thymus. Despite this, the Rasgrp1Anaef mice appear to have normal thymocyte development. However, they do show an accumulation of a specific type of T cell in the peripheral immune system, called a Helios+ PD-1+ T helper cell, and the production of autoantibodies. The authors then went on to investigate the cause of the immune dysregulation in the Rasgrp1Anaef mice. They found that the mutation in Rasgrp1 causes an increase in the activity of a protein called mTOR, which leads to the overexpression of a molecule called CD44 on the surface of T cells. By reducing the activity of mTOR in the Rasgrp1Anaef mice, the authors were able to normalize the expression of CD44 and eliminate the autoantibodies produced by the mice. This study provides important insights into the role of Rasgrp1 in the regulation of T cell development and the immune system, and highlights the importance of understanding the function of specific proteins and their mutations in order to better understand the development of autoimmune diseases.
The study investigates the role of a gene called Arid1a in the development of pancreatic cancer. In the pancreas, Arid1a is an important component of the SWI/SNF complex, which plays a role in regulating the structure of DNA in cells. Arid1a helps to maintain the normal identity of cells in the pancreas. However, when the Arid1a gene is deleted from pancreatic cells, the cells reprogram themselves into cancerous cells. This reprogramming occurs in a context-specific manner, depending on when the Arid1a gene is deleted and whether or not oncogenic Kras is also present. In some cases, the cells reprogram into cancerous cells rapidly, while in other cases they do so more slowly. In another set of experiments, the Arid1a gene is deleted from cells in the pancreas in combination with oncogenic Kras. In these experiments, the cells reprogram into cancerous cells slowly and then undergo rapid progression to cancer. These results highlight the complex interplay between different genes in the development of pancreatic cancer.
Survival threats trigger stress hormone changes. These stress hormone changes depend on a specific area of the brain called the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). This PVN contains neurons that make a stress hormone called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Disruptions to this system can lead to neuropsychiatric diseases. Some of these diseases show differences in how men and women respond to stressors. For example, young girls may be more responsive to changes in social situations than boys. It has also been shown that females take advantage of social support to manage stress better than males. In this study, we looked at how disrupting a social network changed the way these stress hormone neurons worked in male and female mice.
In this study, the authors propose a new way of understanding how different types of hemoglobin work to deliver oxygen to different tissues in the body. They suggest that hemoglobin affinity and cooperativity are not just important for oxygen delivery, but they are actually adaptations that have been optimized over time to improve oxygen delivery. To test this hypothesis, the authors used a mathematical model to relate the Hill coefficient (which measures cooperativity) to the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of a hemoglobin molecule. They then used this model to create a "biophysical Hill landscape" that shows how these parameters affect cooperativity in different ways. By plotting data from a variety of different types of hemoglobin on this landscape, the authors were able to understand how different types of hemoglobin are adapted to different tissues in the body. They also discussed how this approach could be used to understand the evolution of other types of proteins.
Malaria infection starts when a mosquito bites a person and injects tiny parasites, called sporozoites, into the person's skin. These sporozoites then migrate through the skin to invade blood vessels and travel to the liver, where they multiply. Sporozoites move at high speeds through the skin, but their motility is affected by the environment and they have to adjust their adhesion properties to exit from the skin. Researchers used intravital microscopy to watch sporozoites and their interactions with blood vessels in mice. They found that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: in regions far from blood vessels, they move fast, but near blood vessels, they move more slowly and are constrained by the shape of the blood vessels. The researchers also studied two mutant sporozoites: CSΔN and TRAP-VAL. These mutants had problems with their surface proteins that helped them to recognize and enter blood vessels. CSΔN sporozoites had problems with their surface protein and could not move fast enough to enter blood vessels, but they spent more time trying to enter blood vessels. TRAP-VAL sporozoites had problems with their surface protein and moved too slowly, so they explored less volume of tissue and were less likely to encounter blood vessels. Overall, this study showed how sporozoites interact with the environment around them to move effectively and reach their target of entering blood vessels.
Researchers evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) for 1,000 generations without the important polarity gene BEM1. Initially, the BEM1-deleted lineages grew faster than their ancestors. However, over time they reached almost the same fitness as their BEM1 ancestors. The researchers found that the evolutionary trajectory of these lineages involved a common sequence of adaptive mutations that improved cell polarization. These results show that cells can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and suggest that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cellular functions.
In the field of neurobiology, decisions are made by choosing between different options. These options could be between different foods or drinks, between different snacks, or between different financial investments. In these decisions, there are often biases that are not good for outcome maximization. This could include a tendency to weigh losses more heavily than gains or an undue preference for the default or “status quo” option. These biases can be better understood by studying the brain’s activity during decisions. Two parts of the brain, the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), are important in reward-guided decision-making. They are responsible for encoding the value of different options and for choosing the best one. However, these biases make it hard for people to make good decisions. The current study aimed to understand the neural mechanisms that underlie these biases and how they affect decision-making. The study used a task that involved choosing between different investment options, with different outcomes that persisted over time. The results showed that the rmPFC only encoded the value of options that were deferred, and not those that were accepted. This suggested that the rmPFC plays a role in deferral bias. The dACC, on the other hand, only encoded the value of options that were rejected, and not those that were accepted. This suggested that the dACC plays a role in loss aversion bias. Overall, the study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie decision biases and how they affect decision-making.
Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies that form around a long noncoding RNA called Neat1 and four proteins. In this study, researchers found that all of these paraspeckle components displayed a circadian expression pattern. They also found that inserting a repeated sequence of Alu elements in the 3’-UTR of a fluorescent protein gene led to a rhythmic circadian expression of the protein. When the researchers disrupted paraspeckles, this rhythmic expression was lost. These findings suggest that paraspeckles control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.
Scientists have found that the protein Munc13, which is important for synaptic communication, also affects the function of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs). Munc13 interacts with VGCCs through a pair of basic residues in the C2B domain. This interaction controls the behavior of VGCCs during bursts of high-frequency action potentials (APs) and single AP stimuli. The scientists found that this interaction affects the amount of calcium that enters the cell during APs and the ability of VGCCs to recover quickly after APs. These findings suggest that Munc13 plays an important role in regulating the information that is transmitted at nerve terminals by controlling both the process of exocytosis and the trigger that initiates it.
This research paper studies the shape of plant cells and how they function. The authors suggest that the puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of many plants are an effective way to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall. They propose a simulation model that shows how a mechanism that actively regulates cellular stress can create these puzzle-shaped cells. The authors suggest that the puzzle shape of the cells helps to reduce the stress on the cell wall, which could potentially lower the amount of cellulose and other wall material required to maintain mechanical integrity. This research could help to better understand how plants grow and develop.
The process of assembling the spliceosome, a protein complex responsible for splicing, is complex. This study investigates the dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes to examine how these work together to promote pre-spliceosome assembly. The results show that U1 bound to the 5' splice site of an intron and U1 bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron work together to increase the rate and efficiency of U2 recruitment to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. This synergy of 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.
Scientists have discovered a new way to help certain proteins fold properly in a part of the body called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These proteins are important for our bodies to work properly, but they can have trouble folding on their own. To help these proteins fold correctly, scientists found that they can be marked with a special chemical tag. This tag allows a special protein to help the tagged protein fold properly. Once the tagged protein is folded, it is then able to leave the ER. If the tagged protein cannot be folded correctly, it is marked with another chemical tag that sends it to a special place where it can be broken down and recycled. This new discovery is important because it can help scientists understand how to help proteins that are involved in many different diseases.
The human brain is very complex, and there are differences between the brains of males and females. These differences can lead to different ways that males and females think and make decisions. Researchers have found that there are differences between males and females in how they make decisions in experiments. However, these differences can be difficult to detect and can be hard to understand. Researchers have used special tools to better understand these differences by looking at the different ways that males and females make decisions. In this study, they looked at how males and females made decisions in a classic task called the restless two-armed bandit. They found that males and females made different decisions, and these differences could be explained by how males and females explored their options. Males made more exploratory decisions overall, but they got stuck in exploration and took longer to make a decision. Females made fewer exploratory decisions but learned more quickly during these decisions. Overall, this study shows that males and females make different decisions, and these differences can be explained by how they explore their options. These differences could be important for understanding how males and females are affected by certain conditions, such as addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities.
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a major site for protein folding and maturation. When proteins are misfolded or otherwise problematic, they are removed from the ER into the cytosol where they are degraded by the proteasome. This process is called ERAD and involves the action of the ubiquitin proteasome system. Two membrane-embedded ubiquitin ligases are known to play a role in ERAD: Hrd1 and Doa10. The paper investigates the role of Doa10 in ERAD and how it works together with the Cdc48 ATPase.
This study looks at the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, which helps regulate development and tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. It is a well-known signaling pathway that is important for embryonic development and for maintaining the homeostasis of adult tissues. There are several proteins involved in the Hh signaling pathway, including Smoothened (Smo), Patched (Ptc), and Cubitus interruptus (Ci). The authors of this study wanted to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the Hh signaling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly. They used a genetic approach to study the processing of Ci, which is the main transcription factor in the Hh signaling pathway.
This study investigates how pain is processed in the spinal cord. The researchers used a method called optogenetics to activate a specific group of interneurons located in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. These neurons are known to express the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR) and are thought to be involved in the perception of nociception, itch, light touch, and thermal modalities. The researchers found that these CR neurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling. When these neurons were activated in vivo, the rats exhibited significant nocifensive behavior and a conditioned place aversion. Additionally, when these neurons were inhibited using a different method called halorhodopsin, the rats' sensory thresholds were elevated. The results suggest that the dorsal horn circuits that involve excitatory CR neurons play an important role in the generation and amplification of pain and may be a future analgesic target.
Rab23 is a protein that regulates bone growth. In humans, mutations in the gene that codes for Rab23 can cause Carpenter syndrome, which is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities such as polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. To better understand how Rab23 regulates bone growth, the authors generated Rab23-deficient mice that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. The mice exhibit polysyndactyly and premature fusion of multiple sutures, which is a result of aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. The authors then studied the signaling pathways involved in these processes and found that Rab23 negatively regulates FGFR1 signaling, which is elevated in the sutures of Rab23-deficient mice, and the non-canonical regulation of GLI1 through pERK1/2. The authors suggest that Rab23 is an upstream negative regulator of both FGF10-GLI1 signaling and Hh-GLI1 signaling to coordinate the initiation of osteogenesis.
The study demonstrates that one copy of a gene can be repressed while the other is expressed in the same plant. This "mixed" expression state is inherited through many cell divisions. The study provides evidence that the "memory" of FLC expression is stored in cis, not in trans. The study also challenges the idea that heritable information can be stored in patterns of histone modifications.
The ER helps process proteins that are sent to be used outside the cell. These proteins can get tangled up and need the help of chaperones to be unfolded and reformed. There are different types of chaperones that help in different ways. One type of chaperone, BiP, is important for the ER to work properly. In the ER, there can be a lot of different proteins being processed at the same time. When there are too many proteins, it can cause problems. The cell needs to make sure there are enough chaperones to help with the proteins, but too many chaperones can slow down the process. To make sure there are enough chaperones, the cell can turn on certain genes that make more chaperones. But this takes too long, so the cell can also slow down the process by limiting how many proteins are being made.
Flexible filamentous viruses are common plant pathogens that cause significant damage to agriculture. They have non-enveloped, flexible rod-shaped virions that contain a coat protein (CP) and a single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ssRNA). These viruses belong to four different families: Alphaflexiviridae, Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae, and Potyviridae. Structural studies have revealed that the CPs of these viruses have a common architecture, despite differences in their genomic organization and superfamilies. The CPs are arranged in a helical fashion with slightly less than 9 subunits per turn, and the filaments are approximately 120-130 Å in diameter. However, the flexibility of these virions has limited high-resolution structural studies, and most of the previous data were at moderate resolution. Recently, the cryoEM structure of Bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV), another potexvirus, was determined at 5.6 Å resolution, and the CP was modeled based on the atomic structure of a truncated version of the CP from Papaya mosaic virus (PapMV CP). The work revealed that N- and C-terminal extensions of the CP mediate viral polymerization and allow for the flexuous nature of the virions. In this study, the cryoEM structure of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) was determined at 3.9 Å resolution. The near-atomic three-dimensional (3D) map allowed for accurate modeling of the CP, the viral RNA, and their interaction. In-vivo functional studies of several CP mutants confirmed the role of several residues in RNA binding and polymerization. Surprisingly, the CP of flexuous viruses showed a clear structural homology with the nucleoprotein (NP) of the genus Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped viruses with a segmented negative-sense RNA genome. The NPs from phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) protected inside an envelope, in which inserted glycoproteins construct an icosahedral shell. Despite the divergence of both viral groups, the CP from potexviruses and NP from phleboviruses have the same all alpha-helix fold, and their high similarity suggests a horizontal gene transfer event between these evolutionarily distant groups of eukaryotic RNA viruses.
In this study, the authors introduce a new method for determining the location of binding sites on the surface of cells. The method uses a type of microscopy called structured illumination microscopy (SIM) to create a detailed image of the cell surface. The authors then use a special type of image analysis called topological image averaging to determine the distance between a bound ligand and a reference signal channel, which allows them to estimate the location of the binding site on the surface of the cell. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by analyzing simulated images, measuring the height of DNA probes on erythrocyte surfaces, and determining the location of known binding sites on the bacterial surface of Streptococcus pyogenes. They conclude that their method is fast, efficient, and accurate, and can be used to screen for highly conserved and functional epitopes for the development of therapeutic mAbs and vaccines.
Skin is one of the most complex organs in mammals and it reacts differently to environmental changes. Hypoxia (low oxygen supply) in mammalian skin causes an increase in blood flow to improve perfusion. The skin also has constitutive stabilization of hypoxia inducible transcription factor- (HIF) α proteins, which initiate the transcription of multiple genes involved in oxygen homeostasis. Now, we know that in murine skin, cutaneous nitric oxide (NO) levels are determined by differential HIFα isoform expression. This affects both local vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure. We have found that systemic hypoxia induces a tri-modal response: with an initial tachycardia and hypertensive phase that lasts approximately 10 minutes, followed by an immediate and profound drop in heart rate and blood pressure that can last as long as 24 hours, followed by a recovery to close to a normoxic state. Peripheral tissues, in this case the skin, play an essential role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia. This means that peripheral tissues can affect the cardiovascular system in important ways.
Optogenetic methods for circuit mapping have allowed researchers to measure functional synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution. However, there are issues that limit their effectiveness. Two-photon excitation of ChR2 is complicated by its kinetics and low single-channel conductance. To address this issue, researchers have implemented several solutions, including rapid scanning of a diffraction-limited two-photon excitation spot across an opsin-expressing cell and scanless two-photon excitation by temporal focusing, which increases the number of simultaneously excited opsin molecules. These methods have made it possible to provide sufficient two-photon illumination to reliably drive action potentials. However, optogenetic stimulation to selectively target single neurons remains challenging because opsins are expressed throughout the dendritic and axon terminal fields. To overcome this limitation, researchers have combined temporal focusing with spatial confinement of ChR2 expression to the neuronal cell body and proximal dendrites. This has allowed robust and precise activation of neurons in brain slices for the construction of functional synaptic connectivity maps with single-cell resolution without loss of information about local connections in the region of the dendritic arbor of the recorded neuron or inadvertent activation of axons.
Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences to control the transcription of genes. Chen et al. previously undertook a single-molecule analysis of the interactions between the TFs Sox2 and Oct4 in living cells. They used their single-molecule data to determine the binding order of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA. Chen et al. asserted that Sox2 binds first, in approximately 75% of instances, based on the ratio R=K1⁢K3K2⁢K4 , where K1 is the rate of Sox2 binding to DNA, K3 is the rate of Oct4 binding to DNA, K2 is the rate of Oct4 unbinding from DNA, and K4 is the rate of Sox2 unbinding from DNA. Here, we reanalyze Chen et al.'s data using a rigorous biophysical approach. We show that R does not determine the binding order of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA and that R=3.05 implies the presence of energy-expending mechanisms. We introduce the concept of reciprocity to describe how two TFs influence each other's genomic binding. We show that the data of Chen et al. provide evidence for negative reciprocity, which implies energy expenditure, and that the single-molecule methods of Chen et al. offer exciting capabilities for unravelling the mechanisms of gene regulation. We also highlight the importance of the biophysical foundations of gene regulation and discuss the implications of this work for the broader context of understanding the mechanisms of life.
The ability of animals to detect pathogens and mount immune responses upon infection is essential for their health, but this can come at a high metabolic cost. It may therefore be advantageous for animals to detect and avoid pathogens before they are even infected. The bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are important infection cues for the immune system, but it remains unknown whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect LPS before infection. In this study, we found that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, displays strong aversive responses to LPS, and that these responses are mediated by gustatory neurons expressing the Gr66a bitter receptors. We also found that the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance in feeding and egg-laying assays. Our findings suggest that flies detect LPS through a gustatory pathway via TRPA1 activation, which may be a conserved molecular mechanism.
The generation of T cells, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections, is a complex process that involves multiple stages of selection and maturation. One of the key steps in this process is the maturation of SP thymocytes, which occurs in the thymus and prepares them to become fully functional T cells once they leave the thymus. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this step of maturation are not well understood. In this study, the authors identify a protein called Zfp335 as a key regulator of SP thymocyte maturation. They found that a mutation in Zfp335 leads to a deficiency in naïve T cells, which are a type of T cell that has just left the thymus and is ready to fight infections. The authors determined that this deficiency is due to an intrinsic developmental defect that affects SP thymocytes and RTEs. They also identified a set of target genes that are regulated by Zfp335 and found that decreased expression of these genes in mutant thymocytes leads to an impaired maturation process. Overall, the authors' findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate T cell maturation.
There has long been a mystery why the amount of protein in an organism does not always match the amount of its corresponding mRNA. Scientists have been studying this mismatch and have identified three factors that contribute to it: mRNA structure, codon usage (the order of specific codons in mRNA), and mRNA degradation rates. These factors only account for about 40% of the variation, and in some cases, they explain very little of it. In this study, the scientists looked at interactions between ncRNAs (non-coding RNAs) and mRNAs, and they found that these interactions also affect protein abundance. The scientists looked at these interactions by using a computer model to predict which interactions are most likely to occur. They found that in most species, there is less potential for these interactions to occur than there is for controls (which are random). The scientists then designed a way to test how these interactions affect protein abundance. They designed several versions of a protein (green fluorescent protein) that differed in how likely they were to interact with these ncRNAs. They found that the version of the protein that was least likely to interact with the ncRNAs was expressed at the lowest level. This finding shows that avoiding these interactions can help control protein abundance. The scientists suggest that this knowledge could be used to design mRNA in a way that avoids these interactions, which would allow for precise control of protein abundance.
ALS is a disease that causes the death of motor neurons, which communicate with muscle fibers to control movement. In ALS, motor neurons start to die before any symptoms are noticeable. One of the early signs of ALS is a loss of contact between motor neurons and the muscles they control. This loss of contact is called denervation. It is not clear if the denervation is caused by the death of the motor neurons or if it is due to other reasons. To answer this question, researchers used a special camera to watch the contact between motor neurons and muscles over time. They found that the loss of contact happens slowly and that some parts of the contact are lost before others. This suggests that the loss of contact may be due to problems with the communication between motor neurons and muscles, not just the death of motor neurons. This is important because it means that there may be a way to stop the loss of contact before the motor neurons die. This could be a possible target for treatment in ALS.
Tamoxifen is a drug used to treat hormone-sensitive breast cancer. While tamoxifen can effectively reduce the risk of breast cancer recurrence, it has also been associated with various negative side effects, including hot flashes, bone loss, and increased risk of blood clots. These side effects can significantly impact the quality of life of patients who take tamoxifen. The tissues and cells responsible for these negative side effects are not well understood. A study by the authors has found that tamoxifen can cause changes in body temperature, bone density, and movement in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze gene expression changes in the hypothalamus-POA (a part of the brain) after tamoxifen treatment in mice. The study found that tamoxifen treatment can induce widespread changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus-POA. The study also found that tamoxifen treatment can cause changes in estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression in the hypothalamus-POA. Finally, the study showed that ERα expression in the hypothalamus-POA is necessary for tamoxifen-induced changes in gene expression in this part of the brain and for tamoxifen-induced effects on thermoregulation, bone density, and movement. The study provides important insight into the mechanisms underlying the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and suggests that tamoxifen may modulate ERα signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology and health. This knowledge could help researchers develop new or adjuvant therapies that circumvent the side effects of tamoxifen, improve patient quality of life, and potentially enhance survival via increased patient compliance.
Listeria is a type of bacteria that can cause severe infection and even death. There are several ways that Listeria can survive and reproduce in cells, such as in macrophages and epithelial cells. To defend against Listeria infection, the body produces a variety of proteins, known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). One of these ISGs is called ISG15. In this study, researchers discovered that ISG15 is important for protecting cells from Listeria infection. They found that ISG15 expression increased significantly in nonphagocytic cells after Listeria infection. Interestingly, this increase in ISG15 expression did not require type I interferon, which is usually responsible for triggering ISG expression. Instead, it was dependent on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which detects bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7. The researchers also found that ISG15 expression restricted Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo. They used stable isotope labeling to identify ISGylated proteins that could be responsible for this protective effect. They found that ISG15 was conjugated to several proteins, including those located in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which is associated with increased cytokine secretion. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the role of ISG15 in the innate immune response to Listeria infection.
DeepFRET is a new software that can automatically analyze data from single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments. It uses a deep learning algorithm to classify the data into different categories based on the information provided by the smFRET traces. The software is user-friendly and can be used by researchers, medical professionals, journalists, and the general public to analyze smFRET data. It is an important tool for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules.
Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is a protein complex that helps regulate gene expression. SCML2 is a protein that works with PRC1. Scientists found that SCML2 has an RNA-binding region that helps it bind to non-coding RNAs. They also found that SCML2 helps recruit PRC1 to certain genes that it needs to regulate. Deleting this RNA-binding region causes problems with gene regulation and PRC1 recruitment.
This study reports two cryo-EM structures of SecM-stalled ribosomes at 3.3-3.7 Å resolution. These structures reveal two different stalling mechanisms at distinct elongation steps of the translation cycle: one is due to the inactivation of the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center which inhibits peptide bond formation with the incoming prolyl-tRNA; the other is the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site which inhibits the full-scale tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate an elegant control of translation cycle by regulatory peptides through a continuous, dynamic reshaping of the functional center of the ribosome.
The article you are referring to is titled "Foveal Cone Density as a Function of Axial Length in Living Eyes" by Wright et al. . In this article, the authors use an advanced Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. They find that foveal cone density is higher in longer eyes compared to shorter eyes, which challenges the idea that longer eyes have coarser cone mosaics. The authors believe that this result may have implications for the visual acuity of myopes and the development of visual deficits in myopic eyes.
Pneumococcus is a bacterium that causes serious diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media. These diseases are more common in children. Pneumococcus lives in the nasopharynx of people before causing disease. Scientists have found that the duration of carriage (i.e., the time that pneumococcus spends in the nasopharynx) is affected by many factors, including serotype, host immune defense, competition with other bacteria, and host age. However, the overall and relative contributions of these genetic variations to the carriage rate are not yet known. To address this, scientists have developed a model that can calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. The scientists found that the pneumococcus genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, while the host traits considered in the study (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. They further partitioned the heritability into both lineage and locus effects, which quantified the sources of variation in carriage duration. The findings suggest that serotype, drug-resistance, and other significant locus effects are responsible for decreasing the carriage duration. The results support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.
Kv7.1 (KCNQ1) is a type of potassium ion channel that is important for heart function. It is made up of four subunits and can be modified by a beta-subunit called KCNE1. Scientists have been studying the ratio of KCNE1 to KCNQ1 subunits in the channel complex. Using fusion channels, they found that the ratio of subunits can be flexible, with up to four KCNE1 subunits per KCNQ1 tetramer. This supports the variable stoichiometry model for channel complex assembly. The single channel analysis also suggests that a 4:4 ratio of KCNQ1 to KCNE1 maximizes channel conductance.
The zebrafish is a great model for studying how we can heal from injuries. A group of researchers recently discovered that a certain mutant fish called "clo" cannot properly heal from injuries. It turns out that this is because of a problem with the "inflammatory response," which happens when the fish gets hurt. The inflammatory response is supposed to help the fish heal, but something is not working right. The researchers found that the fish are expressing a gene called "il1b" in response to the injury, and this is causing the problem with the inflammatory response. They also found that a type of white blood cell called "macrophages" are responsible for making sure that the inflammatory response is balanced so that it can help the fish heal. When these macrophages are not working properly, the inflammatory response becomes too strong and kills off the fish's ability to heal. The researchers then discovered that the "tal1/scl" mutant fish also has a problem with its inflammatory response, but for a different reason. It turns out that the "tal1/scl" mutant fish does not have enough of the "il1b" gene, which causes the inflammatory response to not be strong enough. This also causes the fish to not be able to heal properly. The researchers then showed that "il1b" is important for the normal healing process. They found that this gene is turned on in response to an injury, and it helps the fish heal by turning on other genes that are needed for healing. Overall, this study shows how important the inflammatory response is for healing, and how "macrophages" help make sure that response is balanced so that it can help the fish heal. It also shows how "il1b" is a key player in the healing process and how it helps turn on other genes that are needed for healing.
The study investigates the impact of protein surface properties and ionic strength on the mobility of proteins in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Haloferax volcanii. Fluorescent protein variants with varying surface charge and distribution were used, and diffusion coefficients were determined by fluorescence recovery after photo-bleaching. The results show that in E. coli, the mobility of proteins is dependent on their net charge and its distribution, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative proteins. This effect is weaker in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The authors suggest that the difference in mobility may be caused by interaction of positive fluorescent proteins with ribosomes. Ribosome surface properties may thus limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. The study adds to our quantitative understanding of diffusion and complements previous studies on the relation between diffusion coefficients and protein size, macromolecular crowding, and dynamic structure of the cytoplasm.
Planarians are animals that can regenerate their entire body from a small fragment. They have a unique ability to create new tissues from a special type of stem cells called neoblasts. However, the signals that activate this regeneration process are not well understood. In this study, scientists discovered that a protein called Smed-follistatin is required for planarian regeneration. They also found that Smed-follistatin only activates regeneration when a large amount of tissue is missing. This protein blocks the effects of other proteins called Activin, which are needed to regenerate tissue when only a small amount of tissue is missing. Additionally, the scientists found that Smed-follistatin is produced in response to injuries that cause tissue to be missing. These results suggest that Smed-follistatin is an important part of the process of initiating regeneration.
Researchers have used advanced sequencing technology to identify mutations that occur in tumors due to a lack of a protein called mismatch repair (MMR). These mutations are different from other tumor mutations and are similar to genetic variations that occur naturally in humans. They have also developed a new test to detect these mutations and found that they are enriched for a certain type of DNA repair pathway. Furthermore, they showed that MMR-deficient tumors are resistant to certain chemotherapies, targeted therapies, and standard treatments. They suggest that identifying the specific mutations that occur in MMR-deficient tumors could help to develop more effective treatments for this type of cancer.
Magnets is a pair of engineered photoreceptor proteins that are small and allow for precise spatiotemporal control of protein-protein interactions in a non-invasive way. However, Magnets have limitations such as needing to be concatenated and needing to be preincubated at 28°C to function. Here, the authors engineered an improved version of Magnets, called eMags, which can function without concatenation and without preincubation. The authors validated eMags by using them to recruit proteins to organelles, to induce organelle contacts, and to reconstitute VAP-dependent inter-organelle tethers. eMags are a very effective tool for optogenetic manipulation of physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes.
Protein translation is a process in which the information contained in a gene is used to make a protein. This process involves several steps, including initiation, elongation, termination, and ribosome recycling. The protein initiation factor eIF2α plays a key role in regulating translation. When activated, eIF2α inhibits the initiation of translation by preventing the formation of the ternary complex, which is necessary for the ribosome to start translation. Recent studies suggest that ribosome stalling, or slowing down during translation, can lead to neuron death. In this study, the authors investigated the signaling pathways that are activated by ribosome stalling. They found that eIF2α is phosphorylated in a tRNA-independent manner in the mouse brain prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. This leads to the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, which functions to attenuate neurodegeneration. The authors also found that the GCN2 protein is a key kinase in the ISR pathway. These results suggest that ribosome stalling activates the ISR pathway through GCN2 to protect neurons from death.
The study found that being taller is associated with increased longevity, better education, and higher earnings. It also found that height is influenced by environmental factors such as nutrition and infections during childhood and adolescence. The study also found that in the past century, the tallest people in the world are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, and the shortest are women born in Guatemala in 1896. The study also found that despite the substantial changes in the ranking of countries over the century of analysis, the height differential between the tallest and shortest populations remained the same for women and increased for men a century later.
The opioid crisis in the United States has reached an alarming level, with 130 people dying each day from opioid overdose . Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is a major cause of death in opioid overdose. Researchers have found that 70-140 neurons in the preBötzinger Complex in the brainstem are responsible for OIRD. This discovery could lead to the development of safer opioids or rescue strategies for opioid overdose.
Scientists have discovered a specific protein called sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) that is responsible for allowing hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) to enter human liver cells. The study involved using a combination of advanced techniques to identify and confirm the interaction between NTCP and the L protein of HBV and HDV. The results of the study suggest that NTCP is a common receptor for both viruses, and that it can be targeted to create new treatments for HBV-related diseases. The discovery of NTCP as a receptor for HBV and HDV is significant because it provides a potential target for new therapies and drugs.
This paper describes how sepsis can cause changes in the number and function of a type of white blood cell called CD8 T cells. These changes can last for a long time and may impair the body's ability to fight off infections. The authors used data from humans and mice to study these changes and found that after sepsis, there is an increase in the proliferation (growth and division) of CD8 T cells, particularly a type of CD8 T cell called central memory cells (TCM). This increase in proliferation results in changes in the composition of the CD8 T cell pool, leading to altered localization (where the cells are found), function (what the cells can do), and protective capacity (the cells' ability to fight off infections). These changes can last for a long time and may impair the body's ability to fight off infections. The authors conclude that sepsis can cause long-term changes in the number and function of CD8 T cells, which may impair the body's ability to fight off infections.
LINE-1 elements are a type of DNA that make up about 17% of the human genome. However, most of these elements are inactive and can't move to new locations in the genome. There are still about 80 to 100 active LINE-1 elements in the human genome. The APOBEC3A (A3A) protein is a human protein that can inhibit the movement of active LINE-1 elements. However, it was previously unknown how A3A does this. In this study, the researchers used an in vitro assay to show that A3A can deaminate the DNA of active LINE-1 elements. Deamination is the process of changing a cytosine (C) to a uracil (U) in DNA. The researchers found that this deamination happens when the DNA of active LINE-1 elements is exposed as single-stranded DNA during the process of integration into the genome. This finding provides a mechanism for how A3A can inhibit the movement of active LINE-1 elements in the human genome.
Sensory experience helps shape our brain by affecting how our neurons work together. Researchers discovered that a molecule called Rem2 is important for experience-dependent plasticity and how our brain functions. They found that mice without Rem2 have problems with late-phase plasticity, meaning they don't adapt to a new sensory experience as well as they should. They also found that neurons without Rem2 have increased activity and a higher rate of spontaneous firing. These findings suggest that Rem2 is a key molecule for regulating neuronal activity and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience.
This paper discusses the potential impact of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells. The paper was motivated by recent reports suggesting that magnetism plays a role in biological systems. These reports include claims of a protein complex that acts like a compass needle, guiding magnetic orientation in animals (Qin et al., 2016), as well as magnetic control of membrane conductance through attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin or heating it with a magnetic field (Stanley et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2016). However, the author argues that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics. The discrepancies are significant, ranging from 5 to 10 log units. If these phenomena are real, they must have causes that are different from those proposed by the authors. The author also found that the paramagnetic nature of protein complexes limits their usefulness for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. The paper provides an introduction to the physical laws by which magnetic fields act on matter and highlights the importance of these laws when considering biological mechanisms in this domain.
Drosophila neural stem cells, also known as neuroblasts, have been used to study self-renewal and differentiation. However, less is known about how these cells switch between self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence states. In this study, researchers found that when neuroblasts enter quiescence, they have low levels of a differentiation factor called Prospero. The authors propose that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation. The study provides a better understanding of how stem cells switch between different states, which can help in designing clinical approaches to aid in quiescence, and therefore in preventing recurrence and activation of cancer stem cells.
HIV-1 is a virus that infects cells by fusing its membrane with the cell membrane and releasing its genetic material into the cell's cytoplasm. Before the genetic material can be used to create new viruses, it needs to be transcribed into DNA. However, this cannot happen while it is still inside the virus, so it must first be released from the virus. This process is called uncoating, and it involves the virus breaking down and releasing its genetic material. Scientists have now developed a way to watch this process happen in real time using fluorescence microscopy. They have found that the first step in uncoating is the opening of a small hole in the virus, which allows the genetic material to be released. This process is controlled by a protein called PF74, which can speed up or slow down the opening of the hole. The second step in uncoating is the rapid collapse of the virus. A polyanion can delay this collapse by binding to a specific part of the virus. By studying the different stages of uncoating and how they are controlled, scientists hope to better understand how to prevent or treat HIV infections.
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women and is caused by genetic mutations. These mutations include "driver" mutations, which promote cancer development, and "passenger" mutations, which do not functionally contribute to the tumor phenotype. Computational methods and functional siRNA screens have been used to identify "driver" mutations in human cancer, and some well-established "driver" mutations in breast cancer include TP53, PIK3CA, and PTEN. The JNK signaling pathway is a three-tiered cascade that includes a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) and two MAP kinase kinases (MAP2Ks). MAP2K4 and MAP2K7 phosphorylate and activate JNK. Sequencing of breast tumor genomic DNA has revealed mutations in genes that encode members of this pathway, including MAP3K1, MAP2K4, and MAP2K7. Loss-of-function JNK pathway mutations are frequently observed in breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to test the role of JNK signaling in breast cancer development. The researchers found that loss of JNK signaling caused breast cancer in mammary epithelial cells, accelerated tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer, and was associated with widespread presence of early neoplasia and genomic instability. JNK plays a key role in the initiation of tumor development, making loss-of-function JNK pathway mutations "driver" mutations that promote breast cancer development.
Cilia are microtubule-based organelles found in many cell types, including bacteria, algae, and mammals. These organelles are involved in many important functions, such as propulsion, sensing, and signaling. However, the process of cilium biogenesis, or how cilia are made, is not completely understood. A new study found that a secretory pathway-localized enzyme called peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) is involved in cilium biogenesis. PAM is responsible for adding a chemical group called an amidine to proteins, which helps them to function properly. This study found that PAM is required for normal cilium assembly in several different cell types, including algae, planaria, and mice. In addition, the study showed that PAM plays a key role in the early steps of cilium assembly. These findings suggest that PAM has a conserved role in cilium biogenesis, and that it is essential for the proper functioning of these important organelles.
In this study, the authors discover that the class III myosin, Myo3, interacts with Espin1, a protein that helps to build and maintain the stereocilia of hair cells, through its tail homology I (THDI) domain. The authors find that THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences, ARB1 and ARB2, which can independently bind to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1 with strong affinities. Using biochemical methods, they show that Myo3 and Espin1 form a 1:2 complex and that the Myo3-Espin1 interaction can release the auto-inhibition of Espin1. Additionally, the authors provide evidence that Myo3-mediated cross-linking of Espin1 can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1. They conclude that Myo3 plays a critical role in regulating the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells by cross-linking Espin1 and promoting actin bundle assembly and stabilization.
Voltage-gated calcium channels, found in muscles and neurons, control important cell functions by opening and allowing calcium to enter. These channels have four repeats, each containing a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and a pore-forming domain. The VSDs are crucial to the channel's function and determine its voltage dependence and kinetics. In this study, researchers used structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of two VSDs of CaV1.1. They discovered that the stabilization of the activated state enhances the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of the resting state slows the kinetics. This finding helps explain how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.
The study aimed to understand the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the adult brain's ability to undergo plastic changes, which is crucial for recovery from injuries or improving learning and cognition. The researchers examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected adult mice. They found that in healthy animals, 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity, while treatment with the inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity, normally lost under these conditions. This suggests that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur.
The extracellular layers of AMPA receptors, which are ion channels found at excitatory synapses in the brain, can move apart from each other during gating. This movement can be measured using cross-linkers, which are chemical compounds that bind to cysteine residues in specific regions of the receptor. This movement can be influenced by the presence of auxiliary subunits, which are proteins that can interact with the receptor and affect its structure and function. The kinetics of this movement can also affect how the receptor interacts with other proteins at the synapse.
Intestinal immune cells are difficult to obtain from mice infected with helminths. This is due to strong anti-parasite immune responses that cause mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration. However, a team of researchers was able to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from the duodenum of infected mice by optimizing a standard intestinal digestion protocol. Using high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, the researchers validated their findings and proved that their cells provided an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses. Their optimized cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed the researchers to identify many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection. This has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that were previously unfeasible.
The human body is made up of many different types of cells, each with its own specific functions. These cells are made up of many different types of molecules, which work together to make the cell function properly. Some of these molecules are proteins, which play many important roles in the cell. Proteasomes are a type of protein that help the cell break down and recycle other proteins when they are no longer needed. These proteasomes have been shown to be important in many different processes, including gene expression, cell division, and protein production. Scientists are interested in learning more about how these proteasomes work and how they can be controlled to help treat diseases. To study these proteasomes, scientists need to understand the dynamics of the peptide-hydrolysis process, which is the process by which the proteasomes break down the proteins. They are also interested in understanding how the activity of these proteasomes varies over time and how it can be affected by different substances. To study these dynamics, scientists have used a combination of experimental and modeling techniques. They have used fluorogenic peptides, which are short proteins that are designed to be broken down by the proteasomes. They have also used other types of proteins to study the effects of different substances on proteasome activity. By combining these experimental data with mathematical models, scientists have been able to gain a better understanding of how proteasomes work and how they can be controlled to help treat diseases.
The article describes how a chemical called histamine is recycled in the visual system of fruit flies. The process involves two types of cells: glia and pigment cells. The article identifies a new transporter that helps to move another chemical called beta-alanine between these two types of cells. Beta-alanine is important for recycling histamine in the visual system. The article shows that a mutation in the gene for this new transporter causes problems with visual neurotransmission and phototaxis behavior. The article also shows that pigment cells play a crucial role in this recycling process by storing beta-alanine and delivering it to glia cells. The article suggests that beta-alanine recycling is essential for maintaining visual neurotransmission in the fly visual system.
In this study, researchers have used a yeast model to investigate the precise roles that oxidants play in aging. They discovered that aging yeast cells experience a sudden redox collapse that affects more than 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. This redox collapse is not caused by an increase in endogenous oxidants, as previously thought. Instead, it is triggered by a decrease in NADPH, which is the electron source for maintaining redox homeostasis. This decrease in NADPH occurs very early during the aging process and sets into motion a cascade of events that ultimately down-regulate most cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a near-universal lifespan extending measure, increases NADPH levels and delays each facet of the cascade. The researchers have also identified a time line of events leading up to the system-wide oxidation of the proteome days before cell death. This study provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between oxidants, aging, and NADPH levels.
This study presents the crystal structure of a protein called D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) from Plasmodium falciparum. DTD is an enzyme that removes D-amino acids from tRNA molecules. The study shows that DTD uses an invariant "cross-subunit" Gly-cisPro dipeptide to capture the chiral center of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA molecules, providing a clear explanation for DTD's ability to act on multiple D-amino acids. The study also explains why the enriched pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step. Overall, the study provides insights into a fundamental enantioselection process and elucidates a chiral enforcement mechanism with a crucial role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of the translational apparatus.
This paper is about studying the spontaneous opening of CFTR, a chloride channel that is important for the body's salt balance, in people with cystic fibrosis. The spontaneous opening of CFTR channels has been found to be rare in wild-type channels, but it is the only way that some mutant CFTR channels open. The paper focuses on studying the energy transfer between different parts of the CFTR channel that is required for the channel to open. This energy transfer is thought to be important for understanding how CFTR channels work in general and how different mutations affect the channels. The paper uses a special mutant of CFTR, called P355A-K978C, to study the spontaneous opening of the channel and the energy transfer required for it to open. By studying these processes, the paper hopes to gain a better understanding of how CFTR channels work and how they can be treated.
When two transmembrane proteins are brought close together, a large force acts between them that is driven by the phase transition of a fluid lipid membrane. This force causes the proteins to assemble into a larger cluster. The force is attractive and is a result of the proteins altering the organization of lipids in the membrane, leading to the formation of an order–disorder interface. The strength of the force is greater than the forces that would be caused by thermal fluctuations or by elastic responses of the membrane. The force acts on proteins that are mismatched with the membrane, causing them to be ordered and disrupting the disordered phase of the lipids. The strength of the force decreases as the proteins become more matched with the membrane. The force can also cause proteins to move from an ordered phase to a disordered phase, leading to the formation of large disordered domains. The orderphobic effect is a pre-transition effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases.
Scientists have been using a technique called calcium imaging to study the activity of neurons in the brain. But it's hard to know when a neuron is active just by looking at its fluorescence. Researchers have been using transgenic mice that express a special protein called GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f in certain neurons in the primary visual cortex of the brain. By attaching a small electrode to a single neuron and measuring its electrical activity, the researchers can compare this information to the fluorescence changes in the same neuron. They found that most electrical activity could be detected when the neuron's soma (the part of the neuron where most of its activity happens) filled the field of view of the microscope, but this is not practical for studying many neurons at once. The researchers also tested several different ways to detect electrical activity from the fluorescence changes. Their results will help scientists better understand the relationship between a neuron's electrical activity and its fluorescence signals.
In this study, scientists have discovered a "switching valve" within the genitalia of a female cave insect called Neotrogla. The valve is composed of two parts that work together to allow the female to store and consume semen from multiple males. This is a novel mechanism that has not been seen in any other insect species before. The researchers used microscopy techniques to study the structure and function of the valve. They found that it allows the female to store two seminal capsules at once and to detach them when they are full. This switching valve may have been an important adaptation for the female to store and consume semen efficiently in her nutrient-poor cave environment.
A research team has studied the process of synaptic-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins in neurotransmitter exocytosis. They used optical tweezers to observe four distinct stages of SNARE assembly in N-terminal , middle , C-terminal , and linker domains (or NTD , MD , CTD , and LD , respectively). They found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affected SNARE assembly and exocytosis, revealing that NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, while MD regulates SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures the t-SNARE C-terminus in a NRD-independent manner. The research team's observations demonstrate distinct functions of SNARE domains whose assembly is chaperoned by Munc18-1.
The integrin adhesome is a complex group of proteins that help cells stick to surfaces. Researchers wanted to understand how these proteins are organized to form these connections. They studied the proteins in the cytosol and found that they are pre-assembled as building blocks that can form adhesion sites quickly and efficiently. They also found that adhesion sites exchange these building blocks with the cytosol in a symmetrical way, which helps maintain the correct specifications of the building blocks. Together, these findings suggest that the integrin adhesome follows a modular and self-organizing approach to forming adhesion sites.
In a recent study, researchers examined the relationship between the 1/f spectral slope of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and the level of arousal in humans. The spectral slope is a measure of the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, and reflects the degree of neural inhibition. The researchers found that the spectral slope is able to differentiate between wakefulness, general anesthesia with propofol, and different stages of sleep, including non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This is a significant finding, as it suggests that the spectral slope can serve as an electrophysiological marker of reduced arousal states, including different sleep stages and anesthesia. These findings have important implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying these states and may have practical applications in the medical field.
We have recently shown that stromules, which are like little tubes coming out of chloroplasts, make connections with nuclei during an innate immune response, and that this helps to move chloroplasts to the nuclei. But we didn't know how stromules were able to make these connections. We have found that stromules extend along microtubules (MTs), which are like long, thin, tubes in cells. We also found that stromules make connections with actin filaments (AFs), which are like long, thin, flexible threads in cells. But stromules don't need AFs to extend, they just need them to anchor to. We found that stromules connect chloroplasts to the nuclei by extending along MTs and attaching to AFs around the nuclei. So we think that stromules may help to guide chloroplasts to the nuclei during an immune response.
The article is about how the amino acid sequences of proteins interacting with each other and how these interactions are important for understanding protein complexes. The study found that residues that make contact across protein interfaces in different proteins tend to coevolve, or change together over time. This could be used to predict which residues in different proteins interact with each other. The article also presents models for four protein complexes that were predicted based on their interactions.
The study shows that eye movements made by humans to extract information from a scene are an active sensing process that is optimized to gather information about abstract categories. This study differs from previous research on active sensing by focusing on a visual categorization task that requires multiple fixations to extract information across different locations. The researchers designed an experiment with gaze-contingent apertures to track the eye movements of participants while they categorized patterns. The results showed that participants select their eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require integrating information from multiple locations. The study provides a new understanding of how humans use their eyes to efficiently gather information to make decisions.
The study is about how large cargo can enter the nucleus. The nuclear envelope (NE) is the boundary between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and it has a transport system called the nuclear pore complex (NPC) that helps cargo move in and out of the nucleus. Most of the cargo can fit through the NE as long as it is smaller than 40,000 daltons (Da). However, some cargos, such as viruses and mRNA, are larger than the threshold. These cargos need to bind to transport receptors that have a special sequence called nuclear localisation sequence (NLS) that can recognize the transport system. The study aims to understand the kinetics of nuclear import of large cargo that binds to transport receptors with NLSs. The study uses a set of 30 large cargo models based on capsid-like particles with a size ranging from 17-36 nm. These cargo models have a number of NLSs ranging from 0 to 240. The study measures the kinetics of nuclear import of these cargo models using spectroscopy and semi-automated microscopy assays. The study also uses a two-parameter biophysical model that describes the relationship between the energy gain from binding to transport receptors and the energy cost needed to insert the cargo into the channel of the NPC. The results show that the larger the cargo and the more NLSs it has, the slower it moves into the nucleus. The study provides valuable insights into the quantitative relationship between the size of cargo and its efficiency in entering the nucleus through the NPC.
T cell activation is the process by which our immune cells defend our body against foreign substances or pathogens. During this process, T cells need two signals to be activated: one from a protein on the surface of immune cells called MHC, and one from another protein called CD28. CD28 is important for T cell activation because it helps the cells to proliferate and differentiate. However, it's not known whether CD28 is also important for maintaining activated T cells after they have been formed. To study this, researchers created mice where CD28 is removed from CD4+ T cells after they are activated. They found that continued CD28 expression is important for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells and the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. They also found that CD28 is required for the clearance of Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract. These results suggest that CD28 is important for maintaining effective T cell responses after they have been formed.
The shape of Helicobacter pylori, a bacteria that causes stomach ulcers and cancers, is helical. However, the mechanisms that generate this shape are not well understood. Researchers investigated the role of CcmA and MreB proteins in this process. They found that MreB is enriched at negative curvature and CcmA at positive curvature. CcmA and MreB promote peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis at these locations, which is one mechanism that helps maintain helical cell shape.
Mitochondria are important for many cellular processes and are constantly undergoing changes in shape. The process of these changes in shape is influenced by a protein called ubiquitin. Recently, researchers have discovered that two other proteins called Ubp12 and Ubp2 can control whether or not mitochondria fuse together. In this study, the researchers found that another protein called Cdc48 is involved in the process of mitochondrial fusion. Cdc48 helps to control which Ubp12 or Ubp2 is used to regulate mitochondrial fusion. When Cdc48 is not present, Ubp12 is used and promotes mitochondrial fusion. When Cdc48 is present, Ubp12 is not used, and instead, Ubp2 is used to inhibit mitochondrial fusion. This study provides new information about the role of ubiquitin in mitochondrial dynamics and how Cdc48, Ubp12, and Ubp2 interact to control this process.
Our study investigated how the brain organizes itself to categorize information in people born blind or sighted. We found that the ventral occipito-temporal cortex, which is responsible for categorizing things like faces, bodies, and tools, responds differently to sounds in blind and sighted people. Specifically, the brain regions responsible for categorizing information responded more strongly to sounds in the blind than in the sighted. Additionally, the categorical organization of sound categories in the blind is different from the categorical organization of visual categories in sighted people. Our findings suggest that the brain has a certain level of plasticity that allows it to reorganize itself in response to different sensory experiences.
The behavior of animals infected with certain microorganisms can be manipulated to the advantage of the microorganism, but how this is accomplished at the molecular level is not well understood, especially in the case of lab-infected flies. The behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen, Entomophthora muscae, infects wild Drosophila and induces abnormal behavior in them before their death. The current study is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie behavioral changes in Drosophila caused by E . muscae. The authors discovered a strain of E . muscae that infects D . melanogaster in the lab and established a method to infect flies with this strain. Lab-infected flies manifest the same moribund behaviors as those observed in wild flies infected with E . muscae. The authors also discovered that the fungus invades the nervous system of infected flies, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus may manipulate host behavior. The researchers believe that the new E . muscae-D . melanogaster system will enable rapid progress in understanding how E . muscae manipulates host behavior.
The authors present a new study that uses photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation ( PAR-CLIP ) to systematically generate transcriptome-wide protein binding profiles for 30 general RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S . cerevisiae ). The binding profiles reveal the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes and are consistent with the canonical degradation pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. The modeling suggests that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation. The decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons. Global analysis suggests that the nuclear surveillance machinery targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes snoRNAs. The authors conclude that their dataset provides a rich resource for future studies of eukaryotic RNA degradation pathways, mechanisms, and the integration of mRNA metabolism.
This study found a new type of bivalent chromatin called "kairostat" that controls the timely induction of defense compound biosynthesis in response to a pathogen signal in plants. This bivalent chromatin is formed by two epigenetic marks that play opposite roles in gene expression: trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) (repression) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 (H3K18ac) (activation). The study used a combination of publicly available epigenomic data and in vivo chromatin modification mapping to identify this bivalent chromatin. Mutants defective in H3K27me3 and H3K18ac suggested that both modifications were required to determine the timely induction of camalexin biosynthetic gene expression and camalexin accumulation under FLG22 treatment. This study revealed a new function of bivalent chromatin, which may be to determine the timely induction of defense-compound biosynthesis in response to a pathogen signal in plants.
We have found that a type of cell called astrocytes in the adult mouse brain has a special ability to make new neurons. This ability is controlled by a protein called EZH2. The EZH2 protein helps keep the astrocytes from becoming the wrong type of cell, like a neuron. We also found that EZH2 is important for making new astrocytes, and that it helps the astrocytes divide and make more of themselves. These results are important for understanding how the brain works and how new cells are made. They may also help us understand how to make new cells in the brain to help treat certain brain diseases.
The study aimed to understand the role of viruses in shaping microbial communities and ecosystem functions in oceanic oxygen minimum zones. The researchers used single-cell amplified genomes from uncultivated bacteria, SUP05, isolated from a marine oxygen minimum zone. They identified 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae. The study showed that ∼1/3 of SUP05 bacteria were viral-infected, with higher infection frequency in areas where oxygen deficiency was more severe. The researchers also found that SUP05 viruses had clonality that suggested they were responsible for terminating blooms. The study also revealed that SUP05 viruses were persistent in the environment, but remained endemic to the oxygen minimum zone. Finally, the researchers found that SUP05 viruses were capable of reprogramming their host's energy metabolism. Together, these results demonstrate the close relationship between SUP05 viruses and their hosts, and their potential impact on ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling.
Cilia and flagella are long, hair-like structures that can be found in a wide variety of organisms, including humans. They are important for movement and sensing in these organisms. These structures are made of long tubes of microtubules, which are maintained by a highly conserved process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). IFT is made up of a number of different proteins, but the functions of these proteins are not well understood. In this study, we focused on one protein, TTC26/DYF13, that was found to be involved in IFT. We used live imaging and biochemical approaches to show that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We also found that the function of TTC26/DYF13 is to transport a specific subset of proteins involved in flagellar motility.
A recent study explored the mechanisms behind melanoma cell metastasis and its correlation with lymphatic invasion. The authors found that exposure to lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) facilitated melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from a 3D growth phenotype to an invasively sprouting phenotype. The study used 3D co-cultures to analyze the molecular crosstalk between melanoma cells and LECs, and found that matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), Notch3, and β1-integrin were involved in this process. The authors also demonstrated that the interaction of melanoma cells with LECs led to increased metastasis in vivo, which was dependent on MMP14 and Notch3.
The aim of this study was to determine the role of microRNA 9 (miR-9) in dendritic and spine development in vivo. To do this, researchers developed a new transgenic mouse model that allows conditional inactivation of miR-9 in specific brain regions at different stages of development. Using this model, researchers found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. They also discovered that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth. This study suggests that miR-9 plays an important role in dendritic and spine development in the brain.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by social communication difficulties and restricted interests or behaviors. Social visual engagement difficulties, which are marked by a lack of preference for social stimuli and a strong preference for non-social stimuli, are hallmark early signs of ASD. In this study, the authors used eye tracking methods and resting state fMRI data to examine functional brain organization and social visual engagement difficulties in ASD toddlers and other non-ASD comparison groups. The authors found that ASD-related functional hypoconnectivity between social brain circuitry such as the default mode network (DMN) and visual and attention networks was associated with increased severity of social-communication difficulties. Increased DMN-occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) hypoconnectivity was also related to increased severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in a subtype of ASD with pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties. The authors concluded that early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature describing this ASD subtype and may be critical for future social-communicative development and represent new treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals.
In Drosophila melanogaster , hemocytes are a type of blood cell that play various roles such as phagocytosis, melanization, and extracellular matrix deposition. These cells arise from prohemocytes in the hematopoietic organs, such as the lymph gland, and differentiate into plasmatocytes or crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are mitotically active cells that expand during larval development by self-renewal. Crystal cells, on the other hand, have been shown to be non-dividing cells that increase in number during larval development, but the mechanism of this increase is unknown. In this study, we show that new crystal cells originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation in the sessile hemocyte clusters located in the last two abdominal segments of the larva. We also show that the structure and architecture of these clusters are necessary for this function. Our findings highlight a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems.
Aneuploidy refers to having an extra or missing chromosome. While aneuploidy is often harmful, it can also provide a quick way for cells to evolve new traits. Researchers recently found that in yeast, an extra copy of a gene can lead to increased expression, but this is not always the case. Some genes can actually be downregulated when there are extra copies. The researchers also found that certain genes that are downregulated when there is an extra copy may actually be amplified in nature to help cells evolve faster. This suggests that cells have a way to adapt to aneuploidy, which can lead to rapid evolution.
Photoreceptors are cells that respond to light, and there are two main types: ciliary photoreceptors (CPRs) and rhabdomeric photoreceptors (RPRs). CPRs have a ciliary membrane that protrudes into the outside environment and can detect light. RPRs have a membrane-bound organelle called a rhabdomere that is inside the cell and can detect light. All photopigments are composed of opsins, which are light-sensitive proteins. In vertebrates, there are two main types of opsins: c-opsins and r-opsins. In invertebrates, however, there are many more types of opsins, including xenopsins. Xenopsins have been found in several lophotrochozoan phyla: mollusks, rotifers, brachiopods, flatworms, and an annelid. They share with some c-opsins a characteristic c-terminal sequence motif and were originally classified as part of the c-opsin family. However, recent phylogenies have shown that xenopsins are distinct from c-opsins and that they were likely present in the last common ancestor of bilaterians. Existing data on the expression of xenopsins are limited to the larval stages of a chiton and a brachiopod. In the brachiopod, xenopsin is expressed in cells with elaborated cilia and shading pigment that are probably pigmented eyespots. In the chiton larva, xenopsin is co-expressed with r-opsin in cells containing both cilia and microvilli. Some of these cells are supported by pigmented cells and probably form simple eyes, whereas others lack pigment and cannot act as visual photoreceptors. Some flatworms (platyhelminthes) have eyes that are composed of photoreceptors with rhabdomes of microvilli that are associated with pigmented shading cells. However, the presence and nature of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms is still unclear. In a polyclad flatworm, there are three different types of ciliary photoreceptors: an epidermal eyespot that is a pigmented epidermal cell with elaborated ciliary membranes, a cerebral eye that consists of a ciliary photoreceptor adjacent to rhabdomeric photoreceptors cupped by a supporting pigmented cell, and distinct extraocular cells in the epidermis that possess multiple cilia projecting into an intra-cellular vacuole known as a phaosome.
In this study, the authors used Targeted DamID to identify Hunchback (Hb) genomic binding sites in two embryonic neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4) that make different progeny. They found that Hb targets were different in each neuroblast, which ruled out the independent specification model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. Importantly, the Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. The authors' findings support a sequential specification model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific Hb binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.
P2X receptors are a group of proteins that switch rapidly between open and closed conformations in response to extracellular ATP. The crystal structures of these receptors have been solved in apo and ATP-bound states. However, the mechanism of pore opening is still unclear. In this study, we used photo-switchable cross-linkers to monitor a series of inter-residue distances in the TM domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. These experimentally based structural constraints combined with computational studies provided high-resolution models of the channel in the open and closed states. We found that the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure, and that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer together during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These results provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins.
Scientists have found that cytokinesis, the process by which animal cells divide into two daughter cells, is controlled by an actomyosin ring that constricts around the middle of the cell. However, this ring may not be formed or may not contract properly in all animal cells. This can lead to cytokinesis failure, which can be harmful in some cells and beneficial in others. The scientists used a genetic technique to investigate how cytokinesis works in the four-cell C. elegans embryo. They found that different types of cells, including embryo cells called ABa and ABp, use different mechanisms to constrict the actomyosin ring. The scientists also found that the actomyosin ring in some types of cells, such as EMS and P2 cells, may not need to contract properly for cytokinesis to occur. Overall, the scientists showed that cytokinesis is regulated differently depending on the type of cell, highlighting the importance of understanding how cytokinesis works in each cell type.
This study looks at the sheath that surrounds the flagellum of some bacteria and how it affects their interactions with host cells. The sheathed flagellum of some bacteria is coated in a membranous sheath of unknown function. This study shows that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum promotes the release of a potent bacteria-derived immunogen called LPS. This is important for understanding how bacteria trigger host immune responses, which can help in the development of new treatments for bacterial infections.
Scientists have found a way to study how the genome reorganizes itself when it becomes unstable during a process called genome elimination. This happens when certain types of proteins called histones, which are necessary for keeping the genome organized, become defective. When this happens, it can cause genetic rearrangements that can be harmful or beneficial to the organism. By studying this process in plants, scientists hope to learn more about how genetic rearrangements happen and how they can cause diseases or lead to genetic diversity.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes several types of cancer. EBV makes cells grow faster and makes them resistant to death. It does this by making a protein called LMP1, which makes it harder for cells to die. However, during early infection, cells still grow and divide, even though they don't have much LMP1. This study tried to figure out how this happens. They used a special way of testing called BH3 profiling to find out which proteins are important for the cells to live. They found that two proteins called MCL-1 and BFL-1 are important during early infection, but not later. They also found that a virus protein called EBNA3A helps control these proteins. This study helps us understand how EBV makes cells resistant to death and could help us find ways to treat EBV-related cancers.
The genetic diversity of specialized metabolites in plants is influenced by various factors. Geography, environment, demography, and genetic processes all contribute to the specific blend and distribution of these metabolites, which helps determine the plant's survival and development. The Arabidopsis glucosinolate (GSL) pathway is a model for studying the species-wide processes driving specialized metabolite variation because the identity of the whole biosynthetic pathway and the major causal loci are known. GSLs are aliphatic compounds that are synthesized using the GS-Elong, GS-AOP, and GS-OH loci. These loci produce distinct chemotypes, and each allele at the loci leads to a specific chemotype. Previous research has shown that variation in the GS-AOP locus results in the modification of the methylsulfinyl (MSO) moiety of the GSLs, resulting in alkenyl or hydroxyl chemotypes. In this study, the authors measured the variation of GSLs across a collection of 797 natural A. thaliana accessions. They found that the distribution of chemotypes and their causes were influenced by geography, environmental parameters, demography, and different genetic processes. The study suggests that causal loci in specialized metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles with patterns that may suggest within-species convergence.
In Drosophila, mutations in the proto-oncogene Ras (RasV12) maintain tumorous cells in an "undead"-like condition and transform caspases from tumor suppressors into tumor promotors. Instead of killing cells, caspases now promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells. These immune cells signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling which further promotes and amplifies caspase activity. This constitutes a feedback amplification loop that is necessary for uncontrolled tumor growth and invasive behavior. Inhibition of this loop strongly reduces the neoplastic behavior of these cells and significantly improves organismal survival.
We often communicate with others through body gestures, and our ability to understand and respond to these gestures reflects our social cognitive competency. This competency is manifested as a shortened subjective duration of social interactions. In other words, social interactions are perceived to be shorter in duration compared with non-social interactions. This effect is stronger in individuals with higher autism-like tendencies. Additionally, intranasal oxytocin administration restores the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, while atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminishes the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings suggest that perceived time is highly idiosyncratic and is influenced by personality traits. They also support the role of oxytocin in mediating time perception of social interactions, further supporting the role of oxytocin in human social cognition.
In this article, the authors examine the interaction between the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the ACE2 receptor protein on human cells. They studied five common mutations in the spike protein and two in the ACE2 receptor found in variants of concern that have emerged worldwide. They found that most of these mutations increased the affinity of the spike protein for the ACE2 receptor, which could make the virus more transmissible. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings for the development of new treatments and vaccines.
The article describes a new approach to understanding how different genes work together to affect the behavior of cells. Genetic interactions occur when the presence of one gene can change the effect of another gene on the behavior of the cell. The authors used a combination of genetic manipulation and automated imaging to create a large map of these interactions in fruit flies. They then used this map to understand how different genes work together to control cell processes. They also used this information to understand how genes work together to control development and disease. This information could be useful for developing new treatments for diseases.
Researchers have found a gene that controls the length of the style in Primula (primroses). The gene, named CYP734A50, is a candidate for the G locus that determines style length. The researchers found that CYP734A50 is specifically expressed in the styles of S-morphs and is not present on the recessive allele, which is present on the L-morph haplotype. The loss of this gene in the recessive allele causes long styles, while its presence in the dominant allele causes short styles. The researchers also found that CYP734A50 is a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme that arose through a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage. The study sheds light on the evolution of the S-locus and its role in promoting outbreeding.
A study looked at how kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Kiss1ARH) were synchronized to release neurotransmitters that controlled the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn controlled the release of luteinizing hormone (LH). The study found that Kiss1ARH neurons synchronized their burst firing activity to release neurotransmitters, including NKB and dynorphin, which in turn excited other neurons that controlled the release of GnRH. The study also found that Kiss1ARH neurons co-released glutamate, which excited other neurons that also controlled the release of GnRH. The combination of synchronized and unified excitation of these neurons caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons, which in turn released LH. Overall, the study found that Kiss1ARH neurons played an important role in controlling the release of LH and therefore reproduction.
Bone morphogenic protein (BMP) helps maintain pluripotency in stem cells and controls differentiation into different lineages. BMP regulates the differentiation of pluripotent cells by controlling an event called downregulation, which happens during early stages of neural and mesoderm differentiation. BMP ensures that a protein called E-Cadherin (Cdh1) is not downregulated, which is a requirement for neural differentiation. BMP also uses a different protein called Id1 to control pluripotency and differentiation. BMP helps maintain a special identity in pluripotent cells that is important for mesoderm differentiation. BMP also controls the neural and mesoderm differentiation of pluripotent cells by ensuring that the right cells express the right proteins. In summary, BMP helps maintain pluripotency and ensures that the right differentiation pathways are followed.
This study looked at the role of a protein called Cep120 in the function of centrioles during quiescence. Centrioles are important microtubule-organizing centers (MTOCs) that help regulate the assembly of the interphase microtubule array and mitotic spindle. The centrosome, which consists of two centrioles surrounded by a matrix of proteins, differs between the old and new centrioles. The old centriole (MC) was formed at least two cell cycles ago and is involved in many activities, such as cilium formation. The new centriole (DC) was formed in the previous cell cycle and has less protein on it. The study found that Cep120, which is enriched on the DC in quiescent cells, plays a critical role by inhibiting untimely maturation of the DC. This means that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by preventing the new centriole from acquiring too many of the protein complexes that are present in the old centriole. If Cep120 is depleted, the new centriole will acquire too much PCM, which will lead to increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. The study suggests that Cep120 is an important protein for the proper function of the centrosome in quiescent cells and may be involved in the pathogenesis of ciliopathies.
Retinal waves are spontaneous activities that occur in the developing retina. During these waves, neurotransmitters are released from retinal synapses, which can activate surrounding cells, including glial cells. We found that retinal waves reliably induce calcium transients in Müller glial cells, and the type of neurotransmitter used to support waves affects the calcium transients. The decline in calcium transients is due to a reduction in the amount of neurotransmitter reaching the glial cells. Our findings indicate that neurons and glial cells exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses.
Scientists have developed a new way to estimate the time since someone died using microbes. They collected samples of decomposing mouse corpses over 48 days and found that the microbial community changed in a measurable and repeatable way. They used high-throughput DNA sequencing to identify the bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes in each sample and found that the composition and diversity of these communities changed over time. The researchers also found that the growth rate of certain microbes, such as fungi, was higher in the initial stages of decomposition and slowed down later. These findings suggest that microbial communities may be useful as a tool for estimating the postmortem interval (PMI) and could help forensic science provide more accurate estimates of the time since someone died.
In the 1990s, researchers defined animals as a group that shares a set of embryonic development traits. However, since then, studies have found that many of these traits are not present in all animals. For example, some species have different developmental genes that do not follow the same patterns during embryogenesis. One major class of developmental genes that is highly conserved in animals is the homeobox gene family. Homeobox genes include the Hox genes, which are responsible for providing positional information during embryogenesis. Previous research has shown that Hox genes are present in all bilaterian animals and some cnidarian species, such as jellyfish and sea anemones. However, in other cnidarian species, such as corals, Hox genes are not present. The lack of Hox genes in these species raises the question of how the Hox gene family acquired its crucial axial patterning functions during eukaryote evolution. In this study, the authors used proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages to show that the Hox–TALE interaction network emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. The authors also found that this network experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Overall, the authors' findings highlight how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans.
In this study, we used super-resolution microscopy to investigate the diffusion of AMPARs outside and within PSDs from rats. We found that >90% of AMPARs labeled with fluorophore dyes or sQDs diffused in confined nanodomains within PSDs, with a lifetime of >15 min. However, less than 10% of sQD-AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. In contrast, 5–10% of bQD-AMPARs were in PSDs, and 90–95% were extrasynaptic. These findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable nanodomains within PSDs, and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. This contradicts the previous hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD slots.
Hypoxia, a condition in which tissues do not receive enough oxygen, causes brain damage and has been linked to several conditions such as stroke, heart attack, and head trauma. In humans, decreased cerebral blood flow (ischemia) resulting in acute neuronal hypoxia correlates with pathological changes in electroencephalographic recordings and decreased electrical signaling in less than 150 seconds. At the cellular level, hypoxia causes an increase in sodium current (INa) in neurons, which precedes a series of events leading to cell death. While the downstream effects of hypoxia have been well studied, the early hypoxia-induced change in Na+ flux has received less attention, despite strong evidence to support its critical role in the hypoxic insult. The study found that hypoxia increases the activity of the SUMO pathway, which increases INa. The study also found that hypoxia causes rapid SUMOylation of NaV1 . 2 channels at the neuronal surface, and this is necessary and sufficient to explain the changes in INa induced by hypoxia. These findings suggest that the SUMO pathway and NaV1 . 2 are potential targets for neuroprotective interventions.
Ross River virus (RRV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that is transmitted to humans through bites of mosquitoes. The authors used a model to understand the role of temperature in the transmission of RRV, specifically how it affects the abundance of mosquitoes. They found that RRV transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (around 26.4°C) and that it declines to zero at both low (around 17.0°C) and high temperatures (around 31.5°C). They also found that transmission is seasonal in temperate regions, but endemic in tropical regions. The model accurately predicted that RRV is a year-round threat in the tropics and that it is a seasonal threat in temperate regions. The authors conclude that nonlinear models are important for understanding the relationship between temperature and disease dynamics.
This study investigates how motor cortical beta oscillations are related to behavior and how they reflect underlying neural population computations. To do this, the study recorded multi-scale neural activity from motor cortex while three macaques performed a novel neurofeedback task, which involved using feedback to control their beta oscillations and subsequently executing an arm reach. The study found that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power exhibited faster movement onset times than reaches preceded by an increase in beta power. Furthermore, the study found that population neural activity shifted farther from a movement onset state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching tasks. The findings suggest that beta oscillations reflect a common signature of spiking patterns even in different task contexts.
TRAF2 is a protein that helps the body defend against illness. It works by binding to a protein called TNFR1 and then helps other proteins to send a message to fight the illness. Some researchers have claimed that TRAF2 can help by itself, but other researchers say it needs help from another protein called SPHK1. In this study, scientists found that in certain tissues, such as mouse dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes, TRAF2 is needed for the body to fight illness. They also found that absence of TRAF2 can cause a type of inflammation in the skin that looks like psoriasis. The study shows that TRAF2 is important for the body to fight illness and protect the skin.
This study is about the way that synapses in the brain recycle their components. The main part of the study is done on neurons that don't have the protein dynamin 1 and 3. Researchers wanted to find out how this affects the recycling process. They used electron microscopy to look at the process and found that the recycling process is not affected by the lack of dynamin 1 and 3. They also looked at the conversion of bulk endosomes to SVs and found that it is not affected by the lack of dynamin 1 and 3, but it is affected by the lack of clathrin. This study provides evidence for a new pathway of SV reformation that does not require clathrin mediated budding or dynamin 1 and 3.
Glucocorticoids (GCs) are commonly used to treat many conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and adrenal insufficiency. However, there is no way to measure the effects of GCs on the body. The aim of this study was to find and validate biomarkers that can measure the effects of GCs. In a study with 10 people with adrenal insufficiency, researchers studied the effects of GCs and withdrawal of GCs on the body. They used a combination of gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), gene expression in adipose tissue, microRNAs (miRNAs), and metabolites to identify potential biomarkers. The strongest potential biomarkers were then replicated in independent study groups with different GC exposure. The researchers found a transcriptomic profile and a multi-omic cluster that were predictive of glucocorticoid exposure. They also identified a microRNA (miR-122-5p) that was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoid exposure. These findings provide a basis for the discovery of biomarkers to measure the effects of glucocorticoids, which could help personalize and optimize glucocorticoid therapy, as well as shed light on the etiology of unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure, such as in cardiovascular disease and obesity.
Mammalian cells can sense their environment to respond to amino acid availability and other stimuli. When amino acids are plentiful, the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is active and helps cells grow and make proteins. When amino acids are scarce, mTOR is inactive, leading to a slow-down in protein synthesis and growth and an induction of autophagy. Scientists have discovered that amino acids are sensed by mTOR via a complex of proteins that is present on late endosomal/lysosomal membranes. The active form of mTORC1, which responds positively to amino acid availability, is found on this membrane. Scientists have also discovered that amino acids are sensed by different proteins inside the cell and at the plasma membrane. They have used live imaging to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of mTORC1 translocation from the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane to the cytosol in response to amino acid stimulation. They found that this translocation is a transient event, occurring within 2 min of amino acid addition and peaking within 5 min. This translocation is temporally coupled with the appearance of fluorescent leucine in lysosomes and is sustained compared to amino acid stimulation. They also used a cell permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester to examine whether mTORC1 responds directly to lysosomal amino acids. They found that mTORC1 translocation is a transient event, and that the primary amino acid sensor is inside the cell.
The study aimed to show how changing the glycosylation of antigens presented by dendritic cells (DCs) affects the nature and strength of immune responses. The authors used a carbohydrate structure called LewisX (LeX) to modify the glycosylation of an antigen called ovalbumin (OVA). They found that LeX modification of OVA directed it to a specific receptor called MGL1, which favored the activation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. They also found that the modification reduced the required amount of antigen for cross-presentation, and it did not require TLR signaling. The authors concluded that modifications to the glycosylation of antigens can have a significant impact on the immune responses they elicit, and their findings may have implications for optimizing current vaccination strategies.
This study shows that the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis uses a type VI secretion system (T6SS) to regulate gene expression through a quorum sensing (QS) system. QS is a process that enables bacteria to communicate with each other and coordinate their behavior in groups. The T6SS is a mechanism that allows bacteria to inject toxins into other bacteria. The study found that the T6SS helps to constrain QS mutants by delivering toxins to them. This study demonstrates a new role for T6SS in interspecies control and highlights its importance in regulating QS mutants.
The long-range connection between the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HP) is important for cognitive performance. In the developing brain, these two areas are connected, but how this connection works is not known. In this study, researchers used optogenetics to manipulate the CA1 area of the HP at neonatal age. They found that the CA1 area of the intermediate and ventral HP (i/vHP) is more important for the connection between the PFC and the HP than the CA1 area of the dorsal HP (dHP). This is important because it helps us understand how the brain works when we are young.
Scientists have discovered that a special region of the protein that helps make RNA, called the C-terminal domain (CTD), is methylated at specific amino acids (lysines) in addition to being phosphorylated. Methylation of these amino acids (lysines) occurs early in the transcription process and is involved in regulating the level of gene expression. The scientists also found that there is a balance between methylation and phosphorylation of these amino acids at the CTD. These findings are important because they provide new insights into how the process of making RNA is regulated.
Skeletal muscle is made up of many small units, each of which can repair itself when injured. These units, called satellite cells, stay in a resting state, or quiescent, and do not divide or grow. When muscle is injured, satellite cells are activated and divide to repair the muscle. They then go back to being quiescent. Researchers are trying to understand the mechanisms that keep satellite cells in the resting state. They found that a protein called TTP breaks down MyoD mRNA when satellite cells are activated. TTP is activated by another protein called p38α/β MAPK, which is activated when satellite cells are injured. When TTP is not active, MyoD mRNA is not broken down, and MyoD protein is made, which helps satellite cells activate and divide. The researchers concluded that TTP is an important protein that helps keep satellite cells in the resting state.
In this study, the authors investigated the role of the IL10 receptor (IL10R) in preventing colitis in infant mice. They found that IL10R-deficient mice did not develop colitis in the first two weeks of life, but signs of colitis started appearing around three weeks of age. Interestingly, IL10R did not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development. However, macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis in infant mice. The absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is indispensable for preventing the development of murine colitis.
Researchers in Caenorhabditis elegans have identified a new protein called SIMR-1 that plays a key role in the piRNA pathway, a process that regulates gene expression in germ cells. SIMR-1 works downstream of piRNA production and upstream of mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. The researchers also found that SIMR-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, which are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. These findings suggest a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex.
Purkinje neurons are an important part of the cerebellum and are responsible for many important tasks such as motor control and learning. However, the question of whether Purkinje neurons show membrane bistability in vivo, meaning they can switch between two stable states, has been disputed. In this study, the authors used intracellular recordings from Purkinje neurons in unanesthetized larval zebrafish to show that these neurons do exhibit membrane bistability. The authors also found that activation of AMPARs by climbing fibers was sufficient to trigger bursts in these neurons. Furthermore, they found that the initiation of motor neuron spiking was correlated with increased incidence of climbing fiber EPSPs and membrane depolarization. The authors concluded that their findings have important implications for understanding how Purkinje neurons contribute to motor function and learning in the brain.
A study by a team of researchers used mathematical models and experimental methods to investigate how actin assembles and generates force during clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), a process by which cells take in large molecules from their environment. The study found that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to drive CME, and that this network adapts to changing loads and membrane tension by self-organizing and bending. The researchers hope that their findings will provide insights into the relationship between actin and plasma membrane mechanics, and how branched actin networks organize and generate force during local membrane-bending processes.
Macropinocytosis is a process that allows cells to take in large amounts of liquid from the outside world. In this process, a cup-shaped structure forms on the cell surface and then closes to form an internal vesicle. The authors of the study use a unique microscopy technique to observe this process in detail. They find that the formation of the cup-shaped structure is guided by two signaling molecules, PIP3 and active Ras, which are organized into patches on the cell surface. These patches are surrounded by a ring of a protein called SCAR, which is important for organizing the actin that makes up the cup. The authors propose that the formation of cup-shaped structures is due to the self-organization of these signaling molecules.
In this study, researchers used X-ray technology to take a 3D picture of the structure of a protein called Scc4. Scc4 works together with another protein called Scc2 to form a complex that helps hold sister chromatids together. This process is called sister chromatid cohesion and is important for successful cell division in all living organisms. This complex is also responsible for determining where cohesin will be loaded in the genome. Cohesin is a protein complex that wraps around sister chromatids and helps keep them together. The researchers found that Scc4 is important for cohesin loading at centromeres, which are specific locations in the genome where sister chromatids are linked together. They also found that Scc4 is responsible for determining the location of cohesin loading. Without Scc4, cohesin cannot be loaded at centromeres, leading to problems with cell division. This study provides important information about how cohesin loading is regulated and highlights the importance of Scc4 in this process.
Being born late in the reproductive season may have important effects on growth and fattening for hibernators, which can influence their winter survival and reproductive output. This study investigated differences in growth, fattening, energy use, winter survival and fecundity between juvenile garden dormice born early in the active season and late in the reproductive season. The study showed that late-born dormice grew and gained mass at higher rates, and used daily torpor to sustain and promote growth and pre-hibernation fattening, even though they reached lower fat content prior to hibernation. Late-born dormice also lost more mass during hibernation but showed similar hibernating patterns compared to early-born dormice. The study also found that fasting juvenile garden dormice employed more often and longer torpor bouts than ad libitum-fed individuals to reach similar levels of fat content prior to hibernation. However, late-born dormice showed a lower level of fecundity than early-born dormice at the subsequent reproductive season. Overall, this study provides evidence that being born late in the reproductive season can trigger energy-saving strategies that can promote growth and fattening, but can compromise winter survival and fecundity in juvenile garden dormice.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of ADAR proteins in regulating gene expression in the worm C. elegans. They found that a mutation in the adr-2 gene caused a chemotaxis defect in C. elegans, but the specific targets responsible for this defect were unknown. The authors used a new method to isolate transcripts from the neural cells of C. elegans and used a new tool called SAILOR to identify over 7,000 A-to-I editing events in the neural transcriptome. They found that clec-41 mRNA is edited in neural cells and its expression is differentially regulated in neural cells lacking adr-2. Restoring clec-41 expression in these neural cells was sufficient to rescue the chemotaxis defect caused by the mutation. This study is the first to identify a specific neural target of ADR-2 and to link its edited expression to a neurological consequence caused by a mutation in the adr-2 gene.
The flu virus, like many other viruses, hijacks the host cell's machinery to produce its own proteins. One way viruses do this is by reducing the production of host proteins. This allows the virus to have more resources to make its own proteins. The flu virus has been known to reduce host protein production for a long time, but how it does this is still unclear. In this study, researchers used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to study how the flu virus affects host protein production. They found that the flu virus reduces the production of host proteins by taking over the host's mRNA pool. They also found that the flu virus affects different types of mRNAs differently. Transcripts that are shorter and have less GC content are affected more by the flu virus. Interestingly, transcripts that encode for proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are not affected as much by the flu virus. This is important because these proteins are needed to make energy for the virus to replicate.
Scientists have discovered a new way that a signaling protein moves from its source to its target cells to create a tissue morphogenesis gradient. Previously, it was thought that signaling proteins like FGF and FGFR spread through passive diffusion in the extracellular space to form gradients. However, the scientists found that the protein FGF is transported directly from producing cells to target cells through cytonemes, which are actin-based specialized filopodia or cytoneme-like projections. They also found that the FGF protein functions as a morphogen, meaning that it induces tissue morphogenesis through concentration-dependent gene expression. This is the first time that cytoneme-dependent signaling has been shown to create a long-range concentration gradient to regulate tissue morphogenesis. The scientists believe that these findings provide an example of morphogenesis in which cytoneme-dependent signaling can provide precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.
Coiled coils are a common protein domain found in many different contexts. They consist of at least two α-helices wound around each other to form a supercoiled bundle. Coiled coils are well understood and their backbone structure can be described using equations. Researchers have discovered a new type of fiber formed by inserting two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. This causes the supercoil to break and the formation of short β-strands that move the path of the chain around by 120 degrees. The result is an α/β coiled coil that has only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. The researchers' findings suggest that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold.
The paper is about a study that used embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple KO mice to understand the function of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The study found that the triple KO cells had a defect in cell division and clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This defect correlated with a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which was confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. The authors conclude that epsin helps generate the force that leads to invagination and then fission of clathrin-coated pits, and that it also has a low affinity interaction with synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2, which may help ensure the presence of a vesicular SNARE in the budding vesicle.
Asthma affects more than 235 million people worldwide, and it is becoming more common in Africa. However, researchers don't fully understand why it's increasing. Previous studies have shown that living in an urban area is associated with a higher risk of asthma in Africa. We conducted a case-control study in urban Uganda among 555 cases and 1115 controls to investigate the risk factors for asthma in schoolchildren (5-17 years). We found that children with asthma had a higher risk of living in urban areas, having parents with higher education, and having allergic conditions. We also found that children born in a small town or city had a higher risk of asthma compared to children born in rural areas. These findings provide the basis for future studies to identify specific environmental and lifestyle factors responsible for increasing asthma risk among children in urban areas in low- and middle-income countries.
In a study of zebrafish, it was found that the pigment cell pattern is caused by a combination of different signals, including long and short-range signals. These signals are secreted by different types of pigment cells, melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. It was found that there are two types of gap junctions between the three types of pigment cells, and these gap junctions are necessary for the pigment cell pattern to be formed. The study showed that a dominant allele of a connexin gene, Cx41 . 8, causes the loss of the pigment cell pattern and that another gene, Cx39 . 4, is required for the pattern to be formed in the trunk of the fish.
The study examines the olfactory systems of three different insect species: the jumping bristletail, the firebrat, and the leaf insect. The olfactory systems of these species were found to have evolved differently. The jumping bristletail appears to lack olfactory receptors, while the firebrat and the leaf insect have olfactory systems with different receptor types. The results suggest that the olfactory system of the jumping bristletail evolved differently than the systems of the firebrat and the leaf insect. This has implications for understanding the evolution of olfactory systems in insects and other animals.
The study investigates the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) on malaria elimination efforts. It uses data from four villages in Myanmar that received MDA and found that people living in low adherence areas had a higher risk of having a malaria episode post-MDA compared to those from high adherence areas. The study also found that spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, may frustrate elimination efforts. The study recommends improving public health infrastructure, including easy access to diagnosis and treatment, an up-to-date and responsive surveillance system, and effective community engagement, before implementing MDA.
This study aimed to compare DNA binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs with human and mouse data. The analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies. This study suggests that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.
In this study, the researchers developed a new strategy for creating a 3D suspension culture of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) that could be used to study the development of both the heart and lungs simultaneously. They used a stepwise approach to induce mesoderm and endoderm progenitor cells, followed by cardiac and pulmonary lineages. They were able to engineer a cardiopulmonary micro-tissue that showed enhanced alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. The researchers expect that their multilineage differentiation model will be a valuable tool for studying cardiopulmonary development during human embryogenesis.
In this study, the authors explored how mutation rates in cells change in response to changes in selective pressure. They found that cells with higher mutation rates have a better chance of adapting to new environments. They also found that changes in mutation rates are driven by cellular mortality and that cells have a limited window of time in which to maintain high mutation rates. This helps to explain why mutation rates are usually low in organisms and why hypermutation is rare.
Plants, animals, and fungi have a protein kinase called SnRK1 that helps them manage their energy levels. SnRK1 can control which enzymes are active and it can also change the activity of genes involved in metabolism. Researchers have found that bZIP63 is a protein in plants that helps control the activity of genes in plants. bZIP63 is regulated by SnRK1, and this regulation can change the activity of bZIP63. The researchers have found that when bZIP63 is phosphorylated by SnRK1, it changes its ability to form dimers with other proteins. This change in dimerization can affect the target genes that bZIP63 regulates. The researchers have identified the specific sites on bZIP63 that are phosphorylated by SnRK1. They have also found that when these sites are mutated, the phosphorylation by SnRK1 does not occur and the dimerization of bZIP63 is affected.
Researchers have discovered a new protein called RNF10 that moves between the synapse and the nucleus in response to signals from glutamate receptors called NMDARs. RNF10 is associated with the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs and moves to the nucleus when activated by synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs. Researchers have also found that RNF10 regulates gene expression and that this gene expression feeds back to the synapse. The discovery of RNF10 as a synaptonuclear messenger protein highlights the complex communication between synapses and nuclei and the potential role of synaptic protein messengers in regulating gene expression and synaptic function.
This study reveals how the ATP-dependent remodeler Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1) interacts with its substrate DNA and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). The structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP (TATA-binding protein), DNA, and NC2 was solved using x-ray crystallography. The results show that Mot1 reduces the interaction between NC2 and DNA and unbends DNA, suggesting that it primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. The structure also reveals that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, paralleling some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a framework for understanding how Swi2/Snf2 ATPases interact with their substrate DNA:protein complex.
Cyclic peptide natural products are a diverse group of molecules that have evolved to target many important cellular processes. A recent study used a series of cyclic peptides with partially elucidated structures to design synthetic variants of ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product. These new ternatin variants are even more potent than ternatin itself, with some having up to 500-fold greater potency. Using a ternatin photo-affinity probe, researchers identified the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex ( eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ) as a specific target of the ternatin variants. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevented ternatin binding and conferred resistance to its cytotoxic effects. The researchers concluded that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products.
Inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL plays a role in endocytosis, which is the process by which cells take in material from outside of the cell. Without OCRL, the endocytosis process does not work properly, and cells accumulate more material than they should. This could be the cause of some of the symptoms of Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease.
Wnt is a protein that is important for the development of many cancers, especially those in the digestive tract. When Wnt is active, a protein called β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus and causes cancer cells to divide more quickly. However, scientists do not know how Wnt is regulated. In this study, the authors found that the proteins FAK, PYK2, and GSK3β work together to control the amount of β-catenin in the nucleus. They also found that a specific part of GSK3β, called Y216, is very important for this process. The authors believe that this discovery will help scientists find new ways to treat colon cancer.
The neural control of moving from one position to another requires the brain to make a transition from reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to another motor control policy. This process is studied using optimal feedback control theory (OFC), which suggests that one control policy must be disengaged before another is engaged. To investigate this idea, researchers used electrical stimulation to study the relationship between ground reaction forces and vestibular signals during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion, and between two standing postures. The results show that discontinuities in vestibular control of balance occur during these transitions, suggesting that there is a discrete change in motor control policies during these transitions.
The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has a circadian clock that regulates the timing of gene expression. This clock is controlled by the protein RpaA, which is the master regulator of circadian transcription. When the clock is free-running in the absence of changes in external light, RpaA schedules the timing of gene expression for when the clock is in its subjective dawn-like state. However, when light and dark periods alternate, the clock's output is used to coordinate the timing of gene expression with the unique metabolic demands of alternating light/dark cycles. In particular, the rpaA- strain is unable to accumulate and utilize carbon reserves during the day and cannot generate energy during periods of darkness. This results in defects in cell growth and viability in cycling, but not constant light conditions. Our results show how the circadian output pathway is used to coordinate the timing of gene expression with the metabolic demands of alternating light/dark cycles to maximize the fitness of cyanobacteria.
Transition metals such as zinc are essential micronutrients in all living things but can be toxic at high levels. Heavy-metal transporting P-type ATPases are crucial for cellular detoxification and redistribution through transport of these ions across cellular membranes. There is little known about the architecture and function of PIB-4-ATPases, which have the broadest cargo scope among the PIB-ATPases. We present the structure and function of an archetypal PIB-4-ATPase, sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1. Our results reveal that the PIB-4-ATPases do not have classical heavy-metal-binding domains and that they have a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine. We also show that the turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium independent. Our results provide new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transporters and open up for efforts in drug discovery, since PIB-4-ATPases function as virulence factors in many pathogens.
In some mammalian genes, only one of the two copies is expressed while the other is not expressed at all. This phenomenon is called monoallelic expression (MAE). MAE is observed in many important human genes that play critical roles in a variety of diseases. However, very little is known about the regulation of MAE. In this study, the researchers found a chromatin signature that can distinguish MAE genes from other genes. This signature is present in about 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes. The signature is enriched among developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure. This study provides a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggests that MAE is linked to cell differentiation.
Scientists have discovered a new way that bacteria control the activity of a protein that breaks down harmful proteins inside cells. The protein, called ClpC, is part of a larger complex that helps bacteria survive under stress. In its inactive state, ClpC is organized into two long chains that are held together by coiled-coil structures. To become active, ClpC needs to switch from its long chains to a ring shape, which is helped along by an adaptor protein called MecA. This discovery could lead to new ways to target and treat bacterial infections.
Researchers in Drosophila have found that stem cells in the fruit fly muscle called AMPs have long cellular processes that connect them to other AMPs. The researchers also found that AMPs connect to neighboring muscles, which act as their niche and provide signals to switch the insulin pathway ON in AMPs. This leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of stem cell behavior and homing in a niche.
The neurons in the basal ganglia of the brain, specifically those found in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, continuously fire action potentials even when there is no input from other neurons. This is achieved by a current that is carried by a specific type of sodium leak channel called NALCN. Scientists discovered this by using single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the genes expressed by individual neurons. They found that NALCN is the highest expressed sodium leak channel in these neurons. They then used electrophysiological experiments to show that when they blocked the activity of NALCN, the neurons stopped firing continuously. They also found that NALCN is involved in the regulation of the excitability of these neurons by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic receptors. These findings could help in understanding the functions of the basal ganglia and in developing treatments for people with genetic mutations in NALCN that cause severe motor and cognitive deficits.
Antibiotics from certain bacteria have saved millions of lives since the 20th century, but resistance to these antibiotics has formed, making them less effective. Scientists have been searching for new ways to grow bacteria that produce new antibiotics. A new method for growing bacteria has been developed using droplet-based microscale cultivation system, which is directly coupled to a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation. This method allows for the cultivation of bacteria that cannot be grown in conventional methods and leads to a significantly higher bacterial diversity than standard agar plate cultivation. Strains that inhibit intact reporter strains were isolated from this system. Various antimicrobial compounds were detected for a selected potent antibiotic producer. This new method for growing bacteria provides a powerful tool for discovering new antibiotics.
Tuberculosis of the brain (TBM) is a serious disease with high mortality rates. Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, are used to treat TBM, but they only have a modest impact on survival. In some studies, patients with a certain genetic variation of a gene that codes for an enzyme called leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) seem to benefit from corticosteroid treatment more than others. However, a study done in Indonesia did not find this benefit, which is why researchers wanted to re-analyze the data from both the Vietnam and Indonesia studies using a different statistical method. Using Bayesian analysis, the researchers found that LTA4H TT genotype is associated with survival in both cohorts, with a significant benefit beginning early in the disease and continuing long-term. The benefit is only seen in patients with a milder form of TBM. This means that patients with the TT genotype are more likely to benefit from corticosteroid treatment, but it is not clear if treatment will harm patients with a different genotype.
The article explains how a protein called Shootin1 helps axons navigate towards a specific location. Shootin1 helps to convert a spatial cue (netrin-1) into a force that drives the growth cone towards the desired location. The article provides evidence that Shootin1 is important for axon guidance, and that it is a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients that result in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance. The article also describes the specific mechanisms through which Shootin1 helps to convert netrin-1 into a force, including its interaction with F-actin and L1-CAM. Overall, the article suggests that Shootin1 is a critical component of the mechano-effector machinery for netrin-1 signaling.
We studied hummingbirds to understand how their unique hum is created. We recorded the sound of their wings flapping and measured the forces on their wings using a new platform. Our research shows that the timbre of the hum comes from the way their wings move and the forces they apply to the air. We compared the hum of hummingbirds to that of insects and found that larger birds produce quieter sounds while elongated flies make louder sounds. Our work provides a new model that explains how hummingbirds and insects create their distinctive sounds.
Scientists have studied how chance, necessity, and contingency impact evolution, but they have never done so in a single system or on timescales relevant to historical evolution. To address this, the authors combined ancestral protein reconstruction and a new continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family to acquire protein–protein interaction (PPI) specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from multiple ancestral proteins, the researchers found that chance played a small role, contingency steadily erased necessity, and contingency arose because historical substitutions changed the sets of possible mutations at any time point.
Scientists have been studying how different people's genes have mixed together over time to create the diversity we see in the world today. They looked at the genetic makeup of 48 different groups of people from Africa and compared them to each other. They found that people from different parts of Africa share a lot of similarities in their genetic makeup, which is likely due to the movement of people over time. They also found that people from Africa share genetic material with people from outside of Africa, which is likely due to the movement of people over time. These genetic similarities and differences between different groups of people can help scientists better understand the history and movements of people in different parts of the world. This information can be very important for studying the causes of different diseases and how they affect different people.
Embryogenesis, or early development, is the process of cell division that leads to the formation of an organism. During this process, the size of the embryo decreases rapidly, and the size of the cells also decreases. The mitotic spindle, a structure that helps segregate the chromosomes during cell division, must adapt to these changes in cell size. Scientists have studied how the spindle adapts to changing cell dimensions during embryogenesis in Xenopus laevis. They have found that spindle size is regulated through a ratiometric mechanism that controls microtubule destabilization. The microtubule-destabilizing kinesin-13 kif2a is a driver of developmental spindle scaling, and its activity is inhibited in small spindles. The inhibition is released when importin α, which is a transport receptor, partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. The results of this study suggest that the changing physical features of the cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and steady-state redistribution of activities.
The study reports the discovery of riboswitch aptamers that naturally exist in either singlet arrangements or in tandem with guanine aptamers. These tandem guanine-PRPP aptamers can bind the target ligands, either independently or in combination, to approximate the function expected for an IMPLY Boolean logic gate to regulate transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis in bacteria. The existence of sophisticated all-RNA regulatory systems that sense two ancient ribonucleotide derivatives to control synthesis of RNA molecules supports the hypothesis that RNA World organisms could have managed a complex metabolic state without the assistance of protein regulatory factors.
Excitatory synapses are responsible for the majority of communication between neurons in the brain. These synapses release neurotransmitters in response to an action potential, and the number of vesicles released varies between synapses. Some synapses release a single vesicle per action potential, while others release multiple vesicles. This study has found that the number of vesicles released per synapse is determined by the size of the pool of vesicles that are ready to be released. This finding suggests a new mechanism for regulating the release of multiple vesicles from synapses.
Scientists have discovered how the HIV-1 virus selectively packages its RNA into virions. They used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag protein, and giant unilamellar vesicles to recreate the selective packaging of the HIV-1 5’ untranslated region (UTR). They found that Gag membrane binding less when it has bound viral RNA. They also discovered that membrane recruitment of the HIV-1 5’UTR by Gag does not lead to drastic changes in its secondary structure and that the association of soluble Gag with tRNA confers additional RNA packaging selectivity. Overall, the researchers have provided important insights into the selective packaging of HIV-1 RNA into virions.
