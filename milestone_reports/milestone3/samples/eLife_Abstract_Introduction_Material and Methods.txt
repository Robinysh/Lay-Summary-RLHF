In this study, we investigate the role of the conserved PRC2 complex in germline stem cell (GSC) regulation in C. elegans. We find that GSCs in Notch ON mutants are able to differentiate into germline tumors. We then show that this phenotype is dependent on the PRC2 complex, as it can be rescued by expressing a functional version of the PRC2 subunit. We then investigate the mechanism by which the PRC2 complex is able to regulate GSC differentiation. We find that the PRC2 complex is able to repress the expression of a specific set of genes, which are required for germline tumor differentiation. Finally, we show that the PRC2 complex is able to repress this set of genes by binding to their promoters and preventing their transcription. These findings suggest that the PRC2 complex plays a crucial role in GSC regulation and that it does so by repressing the expression of specific target genes.
We investigate the role of neutrophils in the pathogenesis of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) infection. We show that neutrophils contribute to the control of bacterial infection in the lungs of mice infected with K. pneumoniae. The data indicate that neutrophils are recruited to the lungs of mice following infection with K. pneumoniae and that neutrophils can kill the bacteria through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We also demonstrate that the Skap2-/- mutation enhances the ability of neutrophils to kill K. pneumoniae in the lungs of mice. Our data suggest that Skap2 is a negative regulator of neutrophil function during infection with K. pneumoniae.
Malaria is a serious disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum and transmitted through the bites of infected mosquitoes. In this article, we will discuss the epidemiology of malaria and how it can be controlled.
The article by Chave et al. (2014) introduced a new method to model forest carbon dynamics based on Bayesian hierarchical models. This method uses satellite data to quantify the impact of logging on forest carbon stocks and provides estimates of long-term forest carbon dynamics. The article has been well-received and has been cited over 200 times.
SVZ cells contain two distinct NIC subpopulations that differ in their self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation potential. We refer to the first NIC population as pre-GEPCOT, and the second as GEPCOT. Pre-GEPCOT cells are mostly quiescent, have low levels of EGFR and GLAST, and low frequency of colony formation. GEPCOT cells are mostly proliferative, have high levels of EGFR and GLAST, and a higher frequency of colony formation. We identified Ascl1 and Nes as markers for NICs. Using these markers, we found that GEPCOT cells are mostly Ascl1+/Nes+, while pre-GEPCOT cells are mostly Ascl1-/Nes+. We also found that pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent, while GEPCOT cells are mostly proliferating. We showed that pre-GEPCOT cells are long-lived, while GEPCOT cells are short-lived. We also showed that pre-GEPCOT cells are capable of self-renewal, while GEPCOT cells are not. Our findings suggest that NICs are heterogeneous and contain distinct subpopulations with different properties.
The current study shows that Piezo1 channels, a type of mechanotransducer that can detect mechanical forces and convert them into electrical signals, behave as independent units. The study used electrophysiology and large numbers of independent measurements to quantify channel number and function, including single-channel current, open probability, and pressure sensitivity. The study also used stochastic simulations to show that Piezo1 ion channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently function as independent mechanotransducers. The study proposes that this property enables cells to transduce forces with high spatial homogeneity across the entire cell membrane.
In the PDW task, monkeys had to choose between two options based on uncertain, fluctuating probabilities. We modeled their behavior using a bounded diffusion model, which allowed us to test whether high volatility leads to faster reactions. We found that volatility did not affect reaction times, but that the monkeys were more accurate when the sure bet was offered. We also found that the monkeys’ accuracy decreased when the sure bet was offered and the stimulus duration was short.
Calcineurin, a phosphatase, plays a role in the regulation of longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 by AKT-like kinases was found to be dependent on calcineurin activity. Calcineurin was also shown to promote the phosphorylation of FOXO3 by CAMKII in mammalian cells. These findings suggest that calcineurin may play a role in the regulation of longevity in a variety of organisms, including humans.
Flies groom themselves by performing a set of movements that target specific parts of their bodies. These movements are defined by different cleaning modules, and the initiation of cleaning movements is based on sensory input and a hierarchy of competing cleaning modules. The hierarchy ensures that flies do not perform too many cleaning movements at once, but instead alternate between different parts of their bodies. In addition, flies can also perform leg rubbing movements to clean dust off their legs.
The study is about how cells coordinate the movements of their chromosomes during meiosis. The authors showed that the protein shugoshin 2 (Sgol2) helps coordinate these movements by protecting chromosomes from being pulled apart, a process that could lead to errors in the formation of chromosomes after fertilization. The authors used mouse oocytes and a variety of techniques to determine that Sgol2 works with several other proteins to coordinate these movements.
We set out to determine whether, in addition to regulating local translation, synaptic stimulation also regulates RNA trafficking from the soma to specific subcellular sites. To examine synapse formation, we cultured a single bifurcated SN with a target (L7) MN, with which it formed glutamatergic synapses, and a non-target (L11) MN, with which it fasciculated but did not form chemical synapses. To study RNA localization during synapse-specific plasticity, we cultured bifurcated SNs with two target MNs and locally perfused 5HT onto the connection with one MN to produce synapse-specific LTF. We found that rRNA, three specific mRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered throughout the SN, to both synaptic and non-synaptic sites, but that translation was significantly enriched at sites of synaptic contact and at sites of synaptic stimulation. These results indicate that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is mediated primarily at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. These results, together with our previous study (Wang et al.,, 2009), suggest the existence of a trans-synaptic signal that promotes translation of localized mRNAs. Our findings are thus consistent with neurons delivering transcripts throughout the neuron, but with a synaptically restricted signal triggering localized translation at synapses.
Morphogenesis is a process that occurs in all multicellular organisms, and is essential for the proper development of tissues and organs. This process is driven by the interaction of cells within a tissue and involves cell-cell adhesion, polarity, and migration. In order to understand the mechanisms that govern morphogenesis, researchers use in vitro models of cell culture, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which are pluripotent cells that can be grown in a laboratory and differentiated into any cell type. However, ESCs are difficult to manipulate, and it is often difficult to control cell-cell interactions and directionality. To address this issue, researchers have developed in vitro models of cell culture using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which are generated from adult cells that have been reprogrammed into a pluripotent state. These cells are easier to manipulate and can be differentiated into any cell type, but they are also prone to epigenetic changes and have lower differentiation efficiency than ESCs. Researchers have been working to develop methods to overcome these challenges, such as using microwells to control cell-cell interactions and using small molecules to induce differentiation. In addition, researchers have developed methods to selectively knock down specific genes in order to study their role in differentiation and morphogenesis. However, these methods are often inefficient and can affect other genes and pathways, making it difficult to interpret the results. To address these challenges, researchers are using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to precisely and efficiently knock down specific genes in human iPSCs, allowing them to study their role in morphogenesis without affecting other genes or pathways.
This study proposes a normative theory that explains how the number of items a person can remember at once affects their memory performance. The theory suggests that the brain tries to minimize two costs: the cost of making errors in recalling the items, and the cost of encoding the items in memory. The study presents a model that uses this theory, and finds that it can accurately predict how performance changes as the number of items to remember increases. The study also explains why the brain might sometimes encode fewer items than it could, and suggests that it might do this to minimize the total cost of recalling the items. The study used data from nine different experiments to test its model, and found that it was able to accurately predict memory performance in all of them.
In this article, the authors investigate the role of the P. infestans effector PexRD54 in the manipulation of host plant defense responses. They first describe the identification of PexRD54 as a P. infestans virulence factor that interacts with ATG8CL and ATG8IL proteins involved in autophagosome formation. They then show that PexRD54 can inhibit autophagosome formation and stimulate autophagosome degradation. The authors also demonstrate that PexRD54 promotes the accumulation of ATG8CL and ATG8IL in the cytoplasm, and that it can block the transport of these proteins to the chloroplast. Finally, the authors show that PexRD54 can block the interaction between ATG8CL and Joka2, a protein involved in the regulation of host plant defense responses. These findings suggest that PexRD54 may play an important role in the manipulation of host plant defense responses by P. infestans.
This study is focused on identifying the initial molecular responses that govern CFs responses to mechanical and oxygen stimuli. A microfluidic platform is used to expose CFs to different combinations of mechanical stimulation (2% or 8% strain at 1 Hz) and oxygen stimulation (PX or HX). The responses of CFs are assessed by analyzing their behavior, including their proliferation, secretion of inflammatory cytokines, and myofibroblast differentiation. The results show that the combination of mechanical stimulation and HX can induce a more significant CF response than mechanical stimulation alone or HX alone. The study highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of mechanical and oxygen stimuli to gain a better understanding of the early molecular responses that govern CFs responses to cardiac injury.
To investigate the dynamic changes in the distribution of histone modifications across the genome during development, we used a novel ChIP-seq method called "scaling chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing" (scaled-ChIP-seq) to measure the relative abundance of specific histone modifications in a population of cells. We applied this method to the Drosophila model organism, where we took advantage of the presence of two closely related species, D. melanogaster and D. virilis, to compare changes in the epigenome during development in two distinct species.
This review article aims to discuss the molecular mechanisms of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development and maintenance, focusing on the function of muscle-specific Ctnnb1. It starts with a brief overview of the importance of NMJ and the molecular basis of NMJ formation, then discusses the functions of muscle-specific Ctnnb1 in NMJ formation and maintenance. It then describes the in vivo and in vitro studies that have been conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of Ctnnb1 function in NMJ. Finally, it concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings and future directions of research.
The paper describes the development of a novel method for quantifying cell-cell forces and E-cadherin recruitment in living epithelial cell clusters. The method combines traction force microscopy with finite element modeling and image analysis to determine both cell-cell and E-cadherin forces in a single measurement. The method is applied to quantify cell-cell forces and E-cadherin recruitment in response to growth factor stimulation and mechanical strain in living MCF10A epithelial cell clusters. The results show that E-cadherin recruitment is tightly correlated with cell-cell forces and that mechanical strain induces the formation of cell-cell stress fibers that recruit E-cadherin. The method provides a powerful new tool for studying cell-cell mechanical interactions and mechanotransduction in living cells.
Huntingtin is a protein that plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the brain and nervous system. It is composed of a long chain of amino acids that can form various structures, including loops and α-helices. The polyglutamine (Q) tract in the amino-terminal region of huntingtin is a hallmark of Huntington's disease. The present study used several methods to analyze the structure of full-length huntingtin containing different Q lengths. The results indicate that huntingtin adopts a 3D structure of a solenoid, consisting of five to six α-helical domains. The Q expansion in the amino-terminal region of huntingtin causes a conformational change in the protein, leading to an increase in α-helical properties. The Q expansion also affects the interactions between the different domains of huntingtin, leading to an overall increase in flexibility of the protein. The present study provides insight into the structure of huntingtin with different Q lengths, which can be useful for developing therapeutic strategies for Huntington's disease.
Iron is a critical element for life that is essential for cellular respiration and other biological processes. It is often stored in the cell as ferritin, a protein complex that sequesters iron and protects it from the Fenton reaction, which can lead to the formation of free radicals and cellular damage. NCOA4 (nuclear receptor coactivator 4) is a recently discovered protein that is required for ferritin biogenesis. It has been shown to be a selective cargo receptor for ferritin, and to bind directly to the FTH1 subunit of the ferritin complex. The HERC2 protein, which contains a HECT domain, has been implicated in the ubiquitination of NCOA4, leading to its degradation. The authors now report that NCOA4 is also degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner, through autophagy. The authors further report that HERC2 is not required for NCOA4 degradation in this manner. The authors also report that the HERC2 protein interacts with NCOA4 through a conserved region of NCOA4 that is required for both ferritin biogenesis and autophagic degradation of NCOA4.
This study explores the neural basis of hierarchical control in working memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM). The study demonstrates that higher-order cognitive control is represented in the left posterior lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC). This control is modulated by the combination of spatial and verbal information, and the order in which that information is presented. The results suggest that the LPFC integrates information from different sensory modalities in a top-down manner and that it may play a key role in hierarchical organization of information. The study also shows that the rostro-caudal axis of the LPFC is organized hierarchically, with rostral regions being more sensitive to incoming information and caudal regions exerting more top-down control. Finally, the study suggests that hierarchical control in the LPFC may be related to cognitive abilities such as working memory capacity and intelligence.
Our research provides evidence that TBC1D3, a protein in the HOPX complex that has been implicated in RG differentiation, promotes RG expansion in the developing cortex. We find that TBC1D3 is highly expressed in RG and a TBC1D3 transgenic mouse has an expanded cortex and more RG cells, while knockdown of TBC1D3 in the developing cortex leads to a reduction in RG cells. We also find that TBC1D3 is required for the expansion of the NRG population and that TBC1D3 may regulate the migration of NRG cells. Our results suggest that TBC1D3 plays an important role in the development of the cortex and may be a potential therapeutic target for neurodevelopmental disorders.
The current study reports the transcriptional reprogramming of NPR1-dependent genes in response to SA treatment in Arabidopsis. The study used genome-wide RNA-Seq analysis to identify genes differentially expressed in npr1-3 and ube4-10 compared to Col-0. The analysis revealed that NPR1-dependent genes were down-regulated in npr1-3 and up-regulated in ube4-10 plants. Furthermore, the study identified a set of NPR1-dependent genes that were up-regulated in response to SA treatment in Col-0 plants. These genes were also up-regulated in npr1-3 plants, but to a lesser extent. The study further showed that UBE4 was required for NPR1-dependent gene expression in response to SA treatment. Finally, the study identified a set of NPR1-dependent genes that were up-regulated in response to SA treatment in ube4-10 plants. These genes were also up-regulated in Col-0 plants, but to a lesser extent.
This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of 24-nt small RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) in Arabidopsis thaliana. The authors used RNA sequencing and in vitro transcription assays to investigate the genomic distribution and transcriptional regulation of P4R2 RNAs. They found that P4R2 RNAs are transcribed by nuclear RNA polymerase IV (NRPD1) and polymerase II (NRPB2) and are primarily located in introns of protein-coding genes. Furthermore, the authors showed that P4R2 RNA transcripts are produced from both ends of the coding sequence, suggesting that P4R2 RNAs are transcribed from bidirectional promoters. The authors also demonstrated that P4R2 RNA processing occurs co-transcriptionally, with the majority of P4R2 RNAs being produced as 21-nt products. Finally, the authors used in vitro transcription assays to show that P4R2 RNA processing is dependent on RDR2, the primary RNA-dependent RNA polymerase involved in small RNA biogenesis.
In this paper, the authors develop a new method to measure the connection strength between fast and slow oscillations in the developing brain. They use a mouse model to show that these connections are important for cognitive development, and that they can be measured using a novel electrophysiological technique. The authors also use human EEG data to show that these connections are important for cognitive development in humans, and that they can be measured using a new signal processing technique. Overall, this work provides important new insights into how the developing brain processes information, and how these processes may be disrupted in neurological disorders.
The spread of pathogens in a population is influenced by factors such as the interactions between different parasites and the immune status of the host. Mathematical models can help us understand these complex interactions and make predictions about how populations of parasites evolve over time. In this study, we developed an agent-based model to understand how different subpopulations of parasites might persist in a population with a high degree of genetic diversity. We used the var gene family of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of malaria, as a model organism, because these genes are very diverse and undergo recombination during transmission. Our model showed that, despite the high genetic diversity of the parasite population, parasites with distinct combinations of genes can be transmitted more efficiently than those with very similar combinations. This is because the immune response of the host is specific to particular combinations of genes, and therefore, parasites with different combinations of genes may evade the immune response of different hosts. Our model also showed that when parasites with distinct gene combinations infect the same host sequentially, they can effectively compete with one another for the available resources, leading to the evolution of distinct subpopulations of parasites with different gene combinations. These results suggest that, despite the high degree of genetic diversity in the parasite population, parasites with distinct combinations of genes can persist and evolve in a host population.
This study investigates the effect of mutations in the UBC13-dUBC13 dimer interface on its interaction with TRAF6RING. The authors used a combination of NMR titration, molecular dynamics simulations, and X-ray crystallography to study the interaction of UBC13 with TRAF6RING in the presence and absence of salt and ATP. They found that the interaction of UBC13 with TRAF6RING is driven by electrostatic interactions, and that the dimer interface of UBC13 is critical for its interaction with TRAF6RING. The authors also found that the mutation of K63 to A in the UBC13 dimer interface disrupts the interaction of UBC13 with TRAF6RING. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into the interaction of UBC13 with TRAF6RING, and identifies key residues that are critical for the interaction.
The present study reveals that divisive inhibition of a single interneuron subpopulation can selectively enhance or suppress the response of a single downstream neuron in the primary auditory cortex. This selective effect is dependent on the tuning of the downstream neuron and the center frequency of the inhibitory interneuron subpopulation. Our findings highlight the potential for diverse computational mechanisms to be implemented through the selective manipulation of subpopulations of interneurons, which is a novel strategy for selectively modulating cortical responses.
This paper reports a study that tested the effects of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) on cognitive performance. The study used two different tACS conditions: synchronous and desynchronous. The results showed that the synchronous condition improved performance on a working memory task, while the desynchronous condition had no effect. The study also used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying these effects. The results showed that the synchronous tACS condition increased activity in the parietal cortex, which is known to be important for working memory. The study also used a novel stimulation paradigm that used short trains of tACS to avoid aftereffects. This paradigm was effective in producing neural and behavioral effects, and is a promising approach for future research. Overall, this study provides evidence that tACS can improve cognitive performance and suggests that the parietal cortex may be a key target for this type of stimulation.
Explaining embryonic development is difficult because it involves complicated and abstract concepts. However, by understanding the basic principles of development, we can begin to understand how different traits arise in living organisms. In this article, we will explore the basic principles of development in chickens and how they have been studied over the years.
In this study, the authors developed a precise and versatile odor delivery system and used it to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of odor stimuli in Drosophila melanogaster. They recorded the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs) and found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns. They also constructed a two-dimensional linear-nonlinear (LN) model that admits the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs and closely predicts the PN output. Their findings suggest that early olfactory circuits primarily signal the acceleration and rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.
The article "Defining a seed coat initiation signal" presents the findings of a study on the initiation of seed coat formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. The authors propose that auxin production in the fertilized central cell of the ovule and subsequent transport to the sporophytic tissues drives seed coat formation. They show that auxin is necessary for seed coat formation and that AGL62, a transcription factor, regulates auxin transport to the sporophytic tissues. The authors also present data on the expression of genes involved in seed coat formation and discuss their findings in the context of previous research. Overall, the article presents important new insights into the initiation of seed coat formation and will be of interest to plant biologists and those interested in the development of agricultural crops.
Phages are viruses that infect bacteria and have been widely used as tools in genetic engineering. In this study, we have described an optimized method to create large libraries of phages with mutations in a specific region of the genome, using the powerful technique of targeted deep sequencing. The method, called ORACLE (Optimized Random Assembly of Constant-length Linkers with Enrichment), involves assembling a large number of fragments of the desired region, each with a unique pair of constant regions on either end, into a circularized DNA molecule. This circular DNA is then used to generate a large number of individual phages, each carrying a different combination of mutations in the region of interest. The resulting phage population is then subjected to selection by growing it on a series of bacteria hosts. We found that ORACLE allowed us to generate large libraries of phages with high enrichment for desired mutations, even on bacteria hosts that are very resistant to phage infection. Our method is a significant improvement over previous methods for generating large libraries of phages with specific mutations, and should be useful for a variety of genetic engineering applications.
The amygdala is a brain region that plays a crucial role in the processing of emotional information. Recent evidence suggests that the amygdala may also be involved in the processing of certain sounds, such as speech sounds. This study aimed to investigate the neural processing of speech sounds in individuals with amusia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by an inability to perceive and process music. The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activity while participants listened to spoken sentences that were either semantically informative or not. The results showed that individuals with amusia had reduced activity in the right auditory cortex and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) in response to semantically informative sentences compared to controls. The authors suggest that the L-DLPFC may play a compensatory role in processing speech sounds in individuals with amusia, while the right auditory cortex may be particularly important for processing music.
Scientists have identified a second contagious cancer in the Tasmanian devil that expresses MHC class I molecules. DFT2 cells express MHC class I molecules, which suggests that the loss of MHC class I expression is not necessary for the emergence of contagious cancers. The researchers also identified the specific MHC class I alleles expressed in DFT2 cells, which will aid in understanding the immune response to this cancer and potentially informing immunotherapies.
Using optogenetic circuit mapping in mice, we reveal a double dissociation in the organization of afferent axons and principal cell dendrites that allows for parallel processing of disparate inputs. Anterior thalamic and dorsal subiculum inputs selectively control low-rheobase (LR) pyramidal cells, while claustral and anterior cingulate inputs selectively control regular-spiking (RS) cells. This precise subtype-specific organization of inputs allows for robust encoding of angular speed by LR cell models, even though these inputs only explicitly encode head direction. Our results suggest that LR neurons are positioned to contribute to initial spatial orientation computations performed in the retrosplenial granular cortex.
We present a novel method for screening zebrafish models of neurodegenerative diseases and seizure-like activity using transgenic zebrafish expressing a tau biosensor. We utilize a modified version of the zebrafish traumatic brain injury (TBI) model, which induces seizure-like activity in a subset of zebrafish. We injected brain homogenate from zebrafish expressing human Tau into the brain ventricles of Tg[elavl3:CaMPARI (W391F+V398L) ]ua3144 zebrafish, which express a calcium sensor in the brain. We found that zebrafish injected with brain homogenate had increased seizure-like activity and that this activity was dependent on tau aggregation. We used a dynamin inhibitor to determine that the endocytosis of tau seeds was required for the observed increase in seizure-like activity. We also found that kainic acid and retigabine reduced seizure-like activity in zebrafish injected with brain homogenate, suggesting that this model can be used to screen compounds for their effects on seizures. Finally, we determined that the tau biosensor can be used to screen for genetic mutations that affect tau seeding and the resulting seizure-like activity. These findings provide a new method for screening zebrafish models of neurodegenerative diseases and seizure-like activity that can be used to identify potential drug targets and disease modifiers.
This article is about using a novel method to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The article describes how the authors collected and processed fMRI data, and then used the method to identify patterns of brain activity that relate to behavior. The method involves first creating a set of different maps of brain activity, and then using these maps to identify patterns in the fMRI data. The article provides a detailed description of the method, and also includes some examples of the results that were obtained using the method. Overall, the article provides a useful overview of the methods that are commonly used to analyze fMRI data, and also introduces a new method that may be useful for future research.
The current study provides a comprehensive characterization of the role of the TBP protein in skeletal muscle regeneration after acute injury in adult mice. The authors demonstrate that the TBP protein is required for optimal acute skeletal muscle regeneration in adult mice. The authors use a TBP-deficient mouse model and demonstrate that TBP-deficient mice have impaired muscle regeneration after acute injury. The authors also show that TBP is required for optimal proliferation of satellite cells, which are responsible for skeletal muscle regeneration. The authors used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to demonstrate the role of TBP in skeletal muscle regeneration. They used RNA-sequencing to identify TBP-dependent gene expression changes in C2C12 myoblasts and found that many of the genes identified are involved in DNA replication and repair. They also showed that TBP is required for optimal differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes. Together, these findings provide a detailed characterization of the role of TBP in skeletal muscle regeneration and highlight the importance of TBP in maintaining proper gene expression programs during skeletal muscle regeneration.
Brain stimulation can be used to treat neurological disorders by inducing changes in neural networks. In this study, we used optogenetics to stimulate neurons in the somatosensory and motor cortices and record the neural responses. We found that stimulation led to changes in network connectivity between the stimulated areas and within the network. These changes were consistent with Hebbian plasticity, a model of how neurons in the brain change their connections in response to experience. These findings have implications for using brain stimulation to treat neurological disorders.
This study presents functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a ventral surface-lesioned macaque (monkey S) to assess the impact of the lesion on brain function. The fMRI data was acquired while the monkey was presented with checkerboard, visual motion, and face stimuli. The results show that while monkey S did not show an in-group behavioral phenotype, the fMRI data revealed significant visual responses in the LGN and V5/MT of monkey S, and a significant pattern of visual responses in the pulvinar of monkey S. The study provides insights into the neural mechanisms of ventral surface lesions in macaques.
This work provides a new mechanistic understanding of how IFI16, a key innate immune sensor, specifically recognizes and distinguishes between self and non-self DNA. The authors found that IFI16 binds dsDNA and forms oligomers on longer dsDNA fragments, but not on shorter fragments. They propose that IFI16 uses a "1D-diffusion assisted assembly" mechanism, where individual IFI16 molecules diffuse along the dsDNA, searching for other protomers to form an oligomer. This mechanism explains why IFI16 preferentially assembles on longer dsDNA fragments. The authors also show that IFI16 assembly on dsDNA is inhibited on host dsDNA, providing a molecular explanation for how IFI16 selectively targets foreign dsDNA.
This article describes a new technique called Spatially Targeted Optical Microproteomics (STOMP) that can identify specific proteins within microscopic regions of brain tissue. The technique uses two-photon fluorescence microscopy to target specific regions of interest in tissue sections, followed by the addition of a chemical label to any proteins present within that region. The labeled proteins are then extracted and analyzed using mass spectrometry. This method has the potential to reveal new information about the composition and structure of brain tissue, which could lead to better understanding of diseases such as Alzheimer's.
The present work reveals a novel role for the protein Frizzled in motor axon growth. Frizzled is a member of the Frizzled family of proteins, which are important for a wide variety of developmental processes involving tissue polarity and directional information. Frizzled is a key player in the guidance of sensory axons, but its role in motor axon guidance was previously unknown. The authors show that Frizzled is required for the development of motor axons in the VIIth cranial nerve, which controls facial movements, and the spinal cord, which controls limb movements. They also show that Frizzled is required for the survival of motor neurons. The findings of this work provide new insights into the role of Frizzled in motor axon guidance and survival.
The authors tested a set of long terminal repeat TE families for roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. Epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggested that a large number of TEs helped to establish tissue-specific gene expression programmes. Genetic editing of individual TEs confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships. However, a wider survey via CRISPR interference of RLTR13D6 elements in embryonic stem cells revealed that only a minority play significant roles in gene regulation. The results suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development, and highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene regulatory roles of TEs.
The evolution of photosynthesis from C3 to C4 plants is a complex process that involves multiple genetic and environmental factors. This study uses Bayesian inference to investigate the evolutionary trajectories that may have led to C4 photosynthesis. The authors first identify 16 traits that distinguish C3 and C4 plants, and then use these traits to create a transition network that describes all possible evolutionary trajectories. They then simulate an ensemble of evolutionary trajectories from the transition network, and calculate the likelihood of observing known C3 and C4 intermediates. The authors find that the most likely evolutionary trajectories involve multiple steps, and that different lineages of C4 plants may have evolved through different trajectories. They also make predictions about unobserved traits in C3 and C4 intermediates, and use qPCR to test these predictions. Overall, this study provides a new approach to understanding the evolution of photosynthesis, and highlights the complexity of this important process.
The article describes a study on the evolution of SpoIVA, a protein involved in the assembly of the spore coat in Bacillus subtilis, a type of bacteria that can survive for thousands of years in harsh conditions. The study found that SpoIVA evolved from a different protein that was ancestral to B. subtilis and other related bacteria, and that its evolution involved changes in the structure and function of the protein. The study also used computer modeling to identify the amino acid residues that are important for the protein's function and stability. Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolution of proteins and their functions in bacteria.
Leptin is a hormone produced by adipose tissue that regulates energy balance and growth in mice and humans. Leptin receptor (LepR) expression is essential for leptin's function, but its importance during development is not well understood. To investigate the role of leptin during development, a mouse model with LepR expression restored after knockout at early life was generated. The authors found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to leptin signaling deficiency in early life, such as poor development of arcuate nucleus neurons, were rescued by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, the absence of leptin signaling in early life impaired energy homeostasis, the melanocortin system, and reproduction and brain development. These findings suggest that leptin signaling is crucial for normal development and that it has lasting effects on energy balance and growth.
This is an abstract of a scientific article published in the journal "Cell". The article describes the role of a protein called XLG2 in plant immunity. XLG2 is a member of a family of proteins called NPX, which are non-canonical G protein α subunits. XLG2 is expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana and is required for effective immune responses to pathogens. XLG2 interacts with a protein called BIK1, which is a central component of the plant immune response. XLG2 also interacts with another protein called XLG3, which is a related NPX protein. XLG2 and XLG3 function together in plant immune responses, and the loss of either protein leads to a decrease in immune effectiveness. The article provides important insights into the role of XLG2 in plant immunity and highlights the importance of non-canonical G protein α subunits in this process.
This article describes the analysis of the circadian clock in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana at the single-cell level. The authors used a novel approach to analyze the bioluminescence data collected from Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grown under constant light conditions. The authors used the R-package “Cosinefit” to analyze the period of the bioluminescence data and found that the period of the whole plant was similar to the period of the individual cells. However, the authors also found that the period of the individual cells varied widely, ranging from 22 to 29 hours. This variation in the period of individual cells suggests that the cells are not completely synchronized, which is consistent with previous studies. The authors also analyzed the amplitude of the bioluminescence data and found that the amplitude of the individual cells also varied widely. The authors also analyzed the spatial patterns of the bioluminescence data and found that there were two waves of bioluminescence, one up and one down the plant. The authors also used a mathematical model to simulate the behavior of the circadian clock and found that the model was able to reproduce the experimental data. Overall, this article provides a detailed analysis of the circadian clock at the single-cell level and sheds light on the mechanisms that regulate the circadian clock in plants.
The study aimed to identify neural biomarkers of poor multi-talker speech intelligibility. The authors tested the hearing of 27 adults with clinically normal hearing and found that their hearing thresholds and speech reception thresholds varied greatly. They also found that the amplitude and phase of the frequency modulation response to a tone were useful predictors of speech intelligibility. The authors suggest that these findings may be useful for identifying individuals who may benefit from hearing aids or cochlear implants.
The article describes the use of adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to measure the blood flow properties of the retinal vasculature in live mice. The authors used a novel split-detection algorithm to measure the velocity of individual red blood cells (RBCs) in the retinal vessels, allowing them to calculate the flow rate of blood through the vessels. They found that the blood flow rate in arterioles and venules was highly variable, but that the flow rate in arterioles was generally higher than the flow rate in venules. They also found that the blood flow rate was dependent on the vessel diameter and the cardiac cycle. The authors believe that their study provides a novel approach to measuring blood flow in the retina, and that it will be useful for understanding the pathophysiology of various retinal diseases.
In this study, the authors present data suggesting that the receptor-like kinase genes Nod Factor Receptor 1 (NFR1), Nod Factor Receptor 5 (NFR5), and Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase (SYMRK) initiate spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. The authors also report that NFR1 and NFR5 associate with endogenous SYMRK in roots of the legume Lotus japonicus. The authors performed epistasis tests that revealed that SYMRK initiates signalling independently of either NFR1 or NFR5 and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking. The authors note that only SYMRK but not NFR overexpression triggered the expression of AM-related genes, indicating that the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development.

DeepLabCut is designed to be simple to use and includes a user-friendly graphical interface that can be used to annotate data and train models without requiring extensive programming experience. The tool is implemented in Python and can be used with a wide range of deep learning libraries.
Inflammasomes are large protein complexes that are formed in response to various intracellular stressors. The formation of inflammasomes is critical for innate immune responses against pathogens and tissue injury. Recent studies have revealed that inflammasomes are also involved in the process of cell death, including pyroptosis, a type of programmed cell death characterized by the release of inflammatory cytokines. However, the mechanisms that trigger the formation of inflammasomes and the signaling pathways involved in cell death are not well understood. In this study, we have identified a small molecule, GB111, that activates inflammasomes and induces pyroptosis in macrophages. We have shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome is a key mediator of GB111-induced pyroptosis and that the formation of the inflammasome is triggered by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate the formation of inflammasomes and the process of cell death.
PALB2 is a crucial protein in DNA repair and homologous recombination. It binds to and regulates the activities of several proteins involved in these processes. In this study, we identified a new functional domain in PALB2, which we named the PALB2 N-terminal domain (PBD). We found that PBD binds to the DNA damage response protein RAD51 and the recombination protein RAD52. We also found that PBD binds to several other proteins involved in DNA repair, including RECQ4 and RECQ4A. We used fluorescence anisotropy, DNA annealing, and strand exchange assays to study the interactions of PBD with these proteins. Our results suggest that PBD is a new functional domain in PALB2 that is involved in DNA repair and homologous recombination.
In this study, the authors provide a detailed description of the structure of the prokaryotic MreB protein from Caulobacter crescentus. They demonstrate that MreB is a member of a novel family of actin-like proteins that do not polymerize in vitro but still exhibit antiparallel polarity in vivo. By using cryo-electron microscopy, the authors show that MreB from C. crescentus forms long, straight filaments with a pitch of 260 Å, and that these filaments form an antiparallel double helix in vivo. The authors also describe a new view of the structural basis of MreB's antiparallel polarity, which is mediated by a specific arrangement of cysteine residues at the ends of the filaments. These findings provide important insights into the mechanisms of MreB function and may have implications for the design of new drugs to target this protein in pathogenic bacteria.
Influenza A/H1N1 (IAV) is a highly contagious pathogen that causes respiratory illness in humans, pigs, and other animal species. IAV has been continuously evolving since its emergence in 1918, resulting in pandemics in 1957, 1968, and 2009. The emergence of IAV is driven by genetic changes that occur in its hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface proteins. These genetic changes can occur through reassortment or point mutations. Reassortment occurs when different strains of IAV infect the same host cell simultaneously, allowing the exchange of genetic material between the different strains. Point mutations occur when a single nucleotide is changed in the viral genome. Both reassortment and point mutations can result in antigenic changes that make the virus more or less pathogenic or infectious.
Islet cells are fundamental for diabetes research as they produce insulin. This study uses biochemical and genetic methods to investigate the mechanism of islet cell dysfunction in diabetes. The authors find that disulfide-linked misfolded proinsulin forms accumulate in islet cells from humans and mice with diabetes. These misfolded forms are responsible for ER stress and cell death. The authors also identify a critical role for the PERK kinase in mediating ER stress and cell death. These findings suggest that targeting disulfide bond formation in proinsulin could be a new therapeutic approach for diabetes.
In this study, we report that Suv39h1 recognizes H3K9me3 in the context of a nucleosome, but not in isolation. Our study also reveals that Suv39h1 is not a histone methyltransferase and does not affect H3K9me3 levels in vivo. Instead, we propose that Suv39h1 functions to recruit HP1 to H3K9me3 marks. Our study suggests that Suv39h1 may play a role in HP1-mediated transcriptional repression.
In this study, the authors investigated the firing properties of neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of monkeys performing a covert attention task. They found that neurons in the EC exhibit spatial firing patterns that reflect the animal's gaze direction. The authors also compared the firing properties of these neurons to those of neurons in the hippocampus and found that they have different firing patterns. The authors suggest that grid cells in the EC may play a role in the cognitive processes associated with attention.
The paper describes a new standardized experimental setup for training mice to perform a decision-making task. The authors found that the task could be successfully trained and performed by mice in seven different laboratories around the world, even though they had not been exposed to the same training procedures. The standardization of the task and the training procedures enabled the authors to compare the performance of the mice across different laboratories and to identify factors that affected their behavior. Overall, the paper provides a valuable resource for researchers who want to study the neural basis of decision-making in behaving mice.
The paper reports the identification and characterization of 1844 unique intestinal transcripts in the planarian Dugesia japonica by laser capture microdissection (LCM) of intestinal tissue. The study builds on a previous work (Farnsworth et al., 2014) that identified a subset of intestinal transcripts using RNA-seq analysis of total intestinal RNA. The authors used LCM to capture a more pure sample of intestinal tissue, which was then used for RNA-seq analysis. This allowed them to identify additional intestinal transcripts and to better characterize the intestinal transcriptome. The study also provides a detailed characterization of 391 intestinal phagocyte-enriched transcripts, 21 goblet-enriched transcripts, and 30 basal-enriched transcripts. The authors also compared their results to previously published microarray-based gene expression data for sorted phagocytes (Forsthoefel et al., 2012) and performed gene ontology (GO) analysis to identify biological processes and molecular functions enriched in the intestinal transcriptome. The study provides valuable information on the intestinal transcriptome of the planarian Dugesia japonica, which can be used as a reference for future studies on the biology of the intestine in planarians and other animals.
Understanding how evolutionary changes in sensory systems affect how animals process information from their environment is a key question in evolutionary biology. Here, we provide an overview of how evolutionary changes in spiking and oscillatory receptors in electric fish can affect their ability to encode information about the timing and amplitude of electric pulses in communication signals. We also discuss how evolutionary changes in these receptors can affect their ability to respond to individual pulses in paired pulses, which are commonly used in mormyrids to convey information about group membership. These changes are important because they provide insights into how evolutionary processes shape the neural mechanisms underlying animal behavior. In particular, they suggest that changes in sensory receptors can have important consequences for how animals communicate with each other and how they perceive their environment.
The authors present a high resolution cryoEM structure of the BPP-1 head. They found that the MCP and CP proteins of BPP-1 are a member of a new structural family of viral proteins. The new structural family has a jelly roll topology and a disulfide-stabilized β-hairpin cement protein. The BPP-1 MCP and CP are similar to their HK97 counterparts in the order of secondary elements, but the CP has a different topology. The authors suggest that the structure of BPP-1 MCP and CP makes them suitable for phage display and protein engineering applications.
In this study, researchers adapted Dengue virus from a human host to a mosquito host using serial passages in vitro. The researchers used a technique called Circular Sequencing (CirSeq) to determine the fitness of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the virus genome at each passage. They found that the fitness of some SNVs in mosquitoes differed from that in humans, indicating that there is selection for different mutations in different hosts. Additionally, the researchers identified SNVs that were lethal in mosquitoes but not in humans, indicating that there is strong selection against these mutations in mosquitoes. They also found that there was strong selection for SNVs that disrupted linear motifs in the virus polyprotein, indicating that these motifs are important for virus replication in mosquitoes. Overall, this study provides important insights into how Dengue virus evolves in different hosts.
Ras is a protein that plays an important role in cell signaling and cancer progression. In this study, the authors used single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) to investigate the diffusion behavior of Ras on the cell membrane. They found that Ras diffused in three distinct states, a fast state, an intermediate state, and an immobile state. They also found that Ras diffusion followed a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) model, with net mass flow from the fast state to the immobile state. These findings provide new insights into the role of Ras in cell signaling and cancer progression.
The development of animal organs requires precise spatial patterning of cells, and this patterning is often regulated by the activity of morphogens. Morphogens are molecules that are produced at specific locations in the embryo and then move through the tissue to regulate gene expression in other cells. The movement of morphogens can be either active or passive, with active movement driven by motor proteins and passive movement resulting from physical forces such as diffusion. The precise movement of morphogens is important for proper development, and is often achieved through a delicate balance of these two mechanisms. However, the rules that govern the movement of morphogens are not well understood, and this is particularly true for passive movement driven by diffusion. In this study, the authors use zebrafish embryos as a model to study the movement of morphogens during organ patterning. By analyzing the movement of a morphogen called BMP, the authors show that passive movement driven by diffusion can be much more complex than previously thought. Specifically, they show that diffusion can be influenced by the physical properties of the tissue, such as the shape and density of cells, and that these effects can be important for organ patterning. The study provides important insights into how morphogens move and how these movements contribute to organ development.
We report the development of a novel mouse model of lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) that exhibits defective lysosome biogenesis. We characterized this model using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches. We found that Lsd1 is required for the differentiation of LSC-like cells into functional lysosomes. Our data also suggest that Lsd1 is required for the degradation of the lysosomal membrane protein Lamp1. Using primary LSCs derived from this mouse model, we identified that Lsd1 is required for the processing of a subset of endolysosomal proteases and lipases. We also demonstrated that Lsd1 is required for the degradation of endolysosomal cargo by autophagy. Finally, we found that Lsd1 regulates the endolysosomal pH, which is critical for the function of many endolysosomal enzymes.
Kinesin is a motor protein that walks along microtubules. The conformation of kinesin changes when it binds a nucleotide, allowing it to move along the microtubule. The conformation of kinesin is influenced by a helix at the beginning of its neck region, which is influenced by the conformation of the microtubule. The conformation of this helix is not well resolved in cryo-electron microscopy maps of the kinesin-microtubule complex. To investigate the conformation of this helix, we performed a molecular dynamics simulation using a cryo-electron microscopy map of the complex as a starting structure. We used a modified molecular dynamics force field to guide the simulation towards the structure of the complex observed in the map. The conformation of kinesin was affected by the conformation of microtubule, and the conformation of the helix in the neck region of kinesin was poorly resolved in the cryo-electron microscopy map. However, the simulation revealed the conformation of this helix to be influenced by the microtubule, consistent with previous studies.
This study identifies novel quality control mechanisms for mitochondrial proteins in yeast. The authors identified two novel substrates for mitochondrial degradation, Sam35 and Sen2, which are involved in mitochondrial fusion and protein import, respectively. They also identified a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase, Ubx2, which is required for the degradation of these substrates. The authors demonstrate that the ubiquitination of Sam35 and Sen2 occurs in the mitochondria and is dependent on Ubx2. They also show that the degradation of these substrates is dependent on the mitochondrial proteasome and is important for mitochondrial function and cell viability. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial protein quality control and degradation in yeast.
This study visualizes the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in living mouse epidermis using a fluorescent biosensor. Under steady-state conditions, the authors found that ERK activity propagated in waves from cell to cell, with the frequency of these waves correlating with the rate of epidermal cell division. This propagation of ERK activity was stimulated by growth factor receptors and was blocked by the inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. The authors also visualized the cell cycle in living mouse skin and found that the propagation of ERK activity was associated with the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. These findings provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronized in a living tissue.
Circadian rhythms are biological oscillations that occur approximately every 24 hours and help regulate many aspects of daily life, including sleep, eating, and hormone levels. The circadian rhythm is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus, which is sensitive to light-dark cycles. When light is present, the SCN is activated and sends signals to other parts of the body to reset their rhythms to the external light-dark cycle. In contrast, when there is no light, the SCN is inhibited and other internal cues, such as hormones, take over. This summary explains the basic principles of circadian rhythms and how they are regulated by light. It also describes the role of the SCN in controlling the circadian rhythm and how internal cues take over when there is no light.
Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) have found that a protein called Meis1 plays a crucial role in sympathetic nerve development. Meis1 belongs to a family of proteins known as Meis homeobox (HOX) transcription factors, which are involved in regulating gene expression during development. In previous studies, Meis1 has been shown to be important for the development of other types of neurons, including sensory neurons and motor neurons. However, its role in sympathetic nerve development has not been well understood.     The researchers used a mouse model in which Meis1 was selectively deleted from the sympathetic nervous system to study its role in sympathetic nerve development. They found that Meis1 is essential for the survival and proper development of sympathetic neurons in the embryo and in the postnatal period. Without Meis1, sympathetic neurons failed to differentiate properly and some died prematurely. The researchers also found that Meis1 is required for the proper formation of sympathetic nerve endings, including synapses, which are the structures where sympathetic neurons communicate with their target cells. Without Meis1, sympathetic nerves had fewer endings and those endings were often abnormal in shape and size.
Understanding how multi-cellular organisms construct and maintain their complex shapes is a fundamental question in biology. In this study, the authors use a combination of experimental measurements and theoretical modeling to explain the morphogenesis of biofilms, complex communities of microbes that are held together by a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances. The study shows that biofilm morphology is determined by the growth difference between the top and bottom cell layers. When the growth rate of the top and bottom layers is different, mechanical stress builds up in the biofilm, leading to instabilities such as wrinkling or delamination. The authors developed a theoretical model that accurately predicts the wavelength of wrinkles and the critical stress required to induce wrinkling. Their findings provide insights into the fundamental mechanisms of biofilm morphogenesis and may have implications for biofilm-related diseases.
We used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures and rats to investigate the transcriptional changes in neurons and astrocytes following epileptic seizures. We found that seizures caused a significant increase in NRSF mRNA in neurons and astrocytes. We also found that the increase in NRSF mRNA in neurons correlated with a significant decrease in the expression of several neuronal genes involved in synaptic function, neuronal differentiation, and neurotransmitter metabolism. These results suggest that seizures may cause long-lasting changes in neuronal gene expression that contribute to the development of epilepsy.
The study explores how the circuits of the olfactory bulb compute and encode odor information. It focuses on the feature selectivity and contrast enhancement of mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) in the bulb. The authors find that MCs are selective for high concentrations of odors while TCs are selective for low concentrations. This feature selectivity is mediated by differences in lateral inhibition, the mechanism by which a cell is inhibited by its neighboring cells. The study provides insights into how the circuits of the olfactory bulb may be able to extract and process information about different odor concentrations.
The authors present a novel approach to study allosteric effects in GPCRs using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay. They have developed a mutant of human M2 muscarinic receptor that can be used to study allosteric effects in the context of an oligomer. The authors demonstrate that allosteric effects characteristic of M2 receptors arise from interactions between the constituent protomers of an oligomer. They have also used molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions between the constituent protomers of an oligomer and to gain insight into the molecular basis of allosteric effects in M2 receptors.
This study shows that SETD2, a protein that adds a specific chemical modification to histones called H3K36me3, is required for proper DNA repair after damage. The study also shows that SETD2 is involved in homologous recombination, a type of DNA repair that uses a template from another chromosome. The study used a variety of techniques, including Western blotting, immunofluorescence microscopy, and gene editing, to show that SETD2 is required for proper DNA repair and that it plays a role in homologous recombination. The study has implications for understanding how certain types of cancers, such as those that arise from defects in DNA repair, develop.
The genetic variant Rasgrp1Anaef in mice is caused by a missense mutation in the EF hand 2 of Rasgrp1. In contrast to Rasgrp1 deletion, Rasgrp1Anaef mice have normal thymic T cell development, but an excessive accumulation of CD44hi, CD62Llo, T-helper cells in the periphery and an increased production of autoantibodies. This phenotype is associated with increased tonic mTOR signaling in naive CD4+ T cells and is dependent on the presence of both Rasgrp1 and CD44.
The provided content describes a study that investigates the role of the SWI/SNF gene Arid1a in the progression of pancreatic cancer. The study uses genetically engineered mice to investigate the effects of inactivating Arid1a at different developmental stages on the formation of precancerous lesions and the progression of pancreatic cancer. The study also investigates the effects of timing on the reprogramming events that occur during the formation of precancerous lesions. The study uses a variety of techniques, including immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry, to analyze the molecular and cellular characteristics of the lesions. The study also uses transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility sequencing to analyze the molecular changes that occur during the formation of the lesions. The study provides insights into the role of SWI/SNF genes in the development of pancreatic cancer and the effects of timing on the reprogramming events that occur during the formation of precancerous lesions.
Researchers have investigated the effects of social isolation on the neuroendocrine response to stress in mice. They found that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of neuroendocrine neurons in the hypothalamus in a sex-specific fashion. Specifically, isolating female mice from their littermates increased the latency time and decreased the excitability of paraventricular nucleus (PVN) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, whereas isolating male mice did not show these changes. These results suggest that social isolation may have different effects on the stress response in males and females, which may contribute to the emergence of sex-specific psychiatric diseases.
Hemoglobin (Hb) is a protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. The amount of oxygen that Hb can carry depends on its structure, which is made up of four identical subunits. These subunits can change their shape in response to different conditions in the body, such as changes in pH or oxygen concentration. The amount of oxygen that Hb carries changes as a result of these changes in shape. Scientists have found that the amount of oxygen that Hb carries can change in two ways: it can change the amount of oxygen that it carries at half-saturation (p50) or it can change the amount of oxygen that it carries as a result of multiple molecules of Hb working together (cooperativity). Scientists have found that both of these characteristics change depending on the size of the organism that the Hb is found in. This is because different-sized organisms have different needs for oxygen, and the amount of oxygen that Hb carries needs to be adjusted to meet those needs. In this paper, scientists used mathematical models to understand how the amount of oxygen that Hb carries changes depending on its structure, and how that structure changes depending on the organism's size. They found that both p50 and cooperativity change in response to organism size, and that these changes work together to help Hb carry the right amount of oxygen to the different parts of the body.
Sporozoites are parasites that cause malaria in humans and animals. They are injected into the skin of a host by an infected mosquito. Once inside the host, sporozoites need to move to the blood vessels to enter the bloodstream. The study presented here used microscopy to watch sporozoites move in real time. The study found that sporozoites move differently near blood vessels compared to far from them. They also found that proteins on the sporozoite surface are important for it to move and interact with blood vessels. The study provides new insights into how sporozoites move in the skin and interact with blood vessels, which can help us develop new ways to prevent malaria.
In this study, the authors used a genetic engineering approach to evolve a cell line that lacks the Bem1 protein. This protein is necessary for the proper functioning of the polarity machinery in budding yeast. By deleting Bem1, the authors were able to observe how cells adapted to this physiologically destabilizing mutation over many generations. They found that Bem1 could be replaced by other genes that perform similar functions in the polarity machinery. This study provides important insights into the evolution of gene function in eukaryotic cells.
This study presents a task in which participants made decisions about potential future rewards, based on whether to commit to a choice or defer it. The study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural basis of these decisions. The authors found that in one condition, in which participants had to commit to a choice with no opportunity to change it later, the right anterior medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) showed a bias towards committing. In contrast, in another condition, in which participants could defer their decision, the rmPFC showed a bias towards deferring. The authors suggest that the rmPFC plays a role in integrating information about rewards and costs, and that its bias towards one decision or the other reflects the relative costs and benefits of committing versus deferring.
The primary cilia are a highly conserved sensory organelle found in most eukaryotes. The central part of the cilium, the "basal body," is anchored to the cell membrane and is composed of nine pairs of doublet microtubules. In addition, the cilium contains a single 9+0 microtubule, which protrudes from the basal body and is surrounded by a membrane-bound organelle called the cilium membrane. The cilium membrane contains many specialized proteins that are involved in the function of the cilium. One of these proteins, the centriole protein Neat1, is a major component of the basal body.
Our study has found that Munc13, a protein essential for nerve function, also plays a critical role in controlling how nerve terminals release neurotransmitters. We found that Munc13 interacts with voltage-gated calcium channels, changing how these channels work at nerve terminals, and thus affecting how nerve terminals release neurotransmitters. These changes are important for controlling ultra-fast plasticity at nerve terminals. Our study shows that Munc13 has profound effects on information transfer at nerve terminals.
The present study proposes that the complex shape of Arabidopsis leaf epidermal cells is an adaptation to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall. The authors use simulations to show that a mechanism that actively regulates cellular stress can plausibly reproduce the development of epidermal cell shape. They also present data from various plant organs and species that support the relationship between lobes and growth isotropy. They suggest that the intricate shapes of these cells reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall, allowing cells to grow larger without bulging. The authors propose that their findings may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell shape patterning.
The provided content is a research article that describes the use of co-single molecule observational spectroscopy (CoSMoS) to study the interactions between individual spliceosomal subcomplexes and pre-mRNAs in real-time. The authors used a combination of cross-interactions and cross-exactions to analyze the interactions of individual subcomplexes and pre-mRNAs in human HEK293 nuclear extracts. They found that the presence of one subcomplex can influence the binding of another subcomplex to the same pre-mRNA, suggesting a cross-talk between the different subcomplexes. The authors also found that the binding efficiency of individual subcomplexes to pre-mRNA can be influenced by cross-exactions, suggesting a cooperative binding behavior between the subcomplexes. Overall, the results of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing and the interactions between different spliceosomal subcomplexes.
This study is about a new folding system for proteins that is located in the cytosol of a cell. Specifically, this system helps with the folding of proteins that are destined to be part of the cell membrane. These proteins have to fold in a special way because they are embedded in the membrane and can't move around freely. The study finds that this folding system works by attaching a special tag to the protein. This tag tells the cell that the protein needs extra help to fold. Once the protein is properly folded, the tag is removed and the protein can move out of the cytosol and into the membrane. This study shows that this folding system is very important for helping proteins that are destined for the cell membrane to fold correctly. Without this system, these proteins would not be able to function properly and this could lead to serious problems in the cell.
Sex differences have been found in cognitive processes that may contribute to mental health vulnerability and resilience. However, detecting and measuring these differences can be difficult because cognitive task performance can vary significantly. Computational tools can help identify latent variables that define different decision-making approaches, even in animals. In this study, the authors used computational tools to analyze the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision-making task in male and female mice. They found that male and female mice had different patterns of exploration and exploitation, with males making more exploratory choices overall and females exploring less but learning more quickly during exploration. These results suggest that sex differences may contribute to vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses, as exploration during decision-making is altered in people with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities.
The provided content contains a research article titled "Recruitment of a membrane-bound E3 ubiquitin ligase to a protein complex by a transmembrane adapter" by Sobotta et al., published in the journal eLife. The article describes the interaction between a transmembrane adapter and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which are both involved in ubiquitination, a process that plays a crucial role in protein trafficking, quality control, and signaling. The authors propose a model in which a transmembrane adapter recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase to a membrane-bound protein complex to facilitate the ubiquitination of a target protein. The article provides experimental evidence from yeast and mammalian cells to support this model, and also discusses the implications of the findings for understanding protein trafficking and quality control in cells. The article is written in a clear and concise manner and provides a comprehensive overview of the topic.
In this study, the authors have developed genomic transgenes that can be used to study the full range of variant Ci activities under strictly physiological conditions. They have used processing-resistant Ci variants to study the effects of inhibition of processing on Ci-155 activation by Fu and Cos2. They found that, in the absence of Hh, PKA inhibits Ci activity independent of the phosphorylation sites that regulate processing. They also found that Cos2 inhibits Ci-155 activity , most likely by binding to the CORD region on Ci-155. The authors have used these mutants to study the effects of inhibition of processing on Ci-155 activation by Fu and Cos2.
The study aims to identify the functional role of CR neurons in the spinal dorsal horn of neuropathic rats by examining their excitatory synaptic responses to photostimulation. The study uses a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to study these responses in the absence or presence of photo-inhibition. The results show that CR+ neurons are essential for generating spinal hyperexcitability in neuropathic rats, and that these neurons can be targeted by photostimulation to effectively alleviate this hyperexcitability. The study also identifies the specific synaptic pathways involved in these responses, and the role of the TRPV1 channel in mediating these effects. These findings suggest that CR+ neurons are a promising target for developing new therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain.
Rab23 is a protein that plays an important role in intramembranous osteogenesis, which is the process by which bones form directly from mesenchymal cells in the body. Rab23 is involved in multiple stages of bone formation, including osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation. In this study, the authors generated a new mouse model with a mutation in the Rab23 gene. These mice had craniosynostosis, a condition in which the bones of the skull fuse together prematurely. The authors then studied the effects of this mutation on intramembranous osteogenesis. They found that the mutation increased the expression of FGF10 and FGFR1, which are important for bone formation. The mutation also increased the expression of GLI1, which is a regulator of bone formation. The authors then tested the effects of exogenous FGF10 on bone formation in these mice. They found that FGF10 could rescue the osteoprogenitor proliferation and differentiation that was disrupted by the Rab23 mutation. Overall, this study provides important insights into the role of Rab23 in bone formation and the potential for therapeutic interventions.
Epigenetic information is crucial for the maintenance of cellular identity and inheritance during cell division. Polycomb-group proteins (PcGs) are a conserved family of epigenetic regulators that repress gene expression through chromatin modification. In Arabidopsis, PcGs maintain repression of FLC, a floral repressor gene, during vegetative growth, but this repression is lost upon vernalization. We have previously shown that PHD finger protein 1 (PHD1) and FLC are spatially co-localized and interact in vitro and in vivo. Here, we show that PHD1-mediated recruitment of PRC2 is heritable. We find that PHD1-PRC2 association is maintained during cell division, suggesting that PHD1 may be inherited by daughter cells. We also show that PHD1 is required for PRC2 recruitment to FLC in a transient manner. Furthermore, we provide evidence that PHD1-PRC2 recruitment is independent of the PRC2 target gene. Together, these data support the idea that PHD1-mediated recruitment of PRC2 is heritable and independent of the PRC2 target gene.
The current study presents a novel chemical probe that rapidly and specifically inactivates the molecular chaperone BiP. This is achieved by an irreversible modification of a cysteine residue in the BiP substrate-binding domain. The study demonstrates the use of this probe to investigate the role of BiP in regulating protein folding in mammalian cells, with a focus on identifying its physiological substrates. The authors propose that the use of their probe could be extended to other molecular chaperones and used in a variety of cellular contexts to study protein folding in general.
The paper presents a 3.9 angstrom resolution cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM) structure of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) virions, which are flexible plant viruses. The structure reveals that the viral coat protein (CP) resembles nucleoproteins (NPs) from the genus Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped (negative sense) RNA viruses. The homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic (positive sense) and (negative sense) RNA viruses. The paper also describes the functional analysis of several CP mutants, which confirmed the role of several residues in RNA binding and polymerization. The structure provides a platform for understanding the evolutionary relationships between flexible filamentous plant viruses.
The immune system is a powerful tool that recognizes and attacks foreign invaders such as viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells. In order to mount an effective immune response, the immune system must recognize specific molecular markers on these invaders, called epitopes. In this study, researchers have developed a new method for identifying the precise location of these epitopes on the surface of cells using imaging-based molecular localization. This method, called SiteLoc, uses a process called topological image averaging to calculate the average distance from a bound ligand to a reference surface, which can reveal the location of the epitope. The researchers tested this method using various simulations and experiments with bacteria and human red blood cells. Their results show that SiteLoc can accurately estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical cells, even in the presence of heterogeneous expression of surface proteins. The researchers believe that SiteLoc could be a valuable tool for developing new therapies and vaccines, as well as for understanding the immune system's interactions with foreign invaders.
In this study, the authors investigated the role of skin HIF-1α and HIF-2α in the cardiovascular response to hypoxia. The authors used a radio-telemetry device to measure heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature in mice with targeted deletions of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NOS2, or Arg1 in keratinocytes. The results showed that the skin HIF-1α and HIF-2α play an important role in the cardiovascular response to hypoxia. The authors also found that the skin NOS2 and Arg1 are involved in this response. Overall, the study demonstrates the important role of peripheral tissues in the cardiovascular response to hypoxia.
This paper describes a novel approach for performing functional mapping of neural circuitry using two-photon microscopy and optical stimulation. By combining temporal focusing of excitation and spatial restriction of ChR2 expression, the authors were able to reliably evoke action potentials and verify synaptic connectivity with single-cell resolution. This approach has important implications for the study of neural circuits and for the development of optogenetic tools.
This is an article about reciprocity between two transcription factors, Oct4 and Sox2, which bind to DNA. The authors describe a mathematical model to study how the binding of one transcription factor affects the binding of the other, and vice versa. They use this model to analyze data from single-cell experiments. The authors find that the binding of Oct4 helps the binding of Sox2, and the binding of Sox2 helps the binding of Oct4. They also find that the strength of this reciprocity is dependent on the concentration of each transcription factor. The authors conclude that their model provides a framework for studying the interplay between transcription factors in single cells.
The study demonstrates that Drosophila melanogaster have a gustatory system that detects lipopolysaccharides (LPS) through TRPA1 channels. LPS is a bacterial endotoxin that can stimulate an immune response, and the study suggests that the gustatory system may play a role in detecting LPS and avoiding ingesting bacteria before infection. The study used several methods to examine the detection of LPS, including aversive feeding and egg laying assays, in vivo Ca2+ imaging, and patch-clamp recordings. Overall, the results support the idea that TRPA1 channels may play a role in detecting LPS in the gustatory system.
We report a novel point mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp335 that causes a deficiency in mature T cells in mice. Zfp335 is required for the development of mature T cells in the thymus, and its expression is important for maintaining the viability of mature T cells in the periphery. We found that Zfp335 mutant mice have reduced thymic T cell development and exhibit increased sensitivity to antigen-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest that Zfp335 plays a key role in regulating the development and survival of mature T cells.
Protein expression is important to the health of cells, and the proteome determines how a cell responds to different stimuli. A key factor in determining protein levels is the amount of mRNA that is transcribed. However, mRNA expression is not always well correlated with protein levels, suggesting that additional factors may affect protein expression. These additional factors could include post-transcriptional mRNA processing or interactions between mRNAs and other molecules. The authors of this article found that the extent of interactions between mRNAs and ncRNAs can affect the expression of both mRNAs and ncRNAs. They found that interactions between ncRNAs and mRNAs are more prevalent than interactions between ncRNAs themselves, and that ncRNAs interact more with mRNAs that are more similar in sequence. They also found that the extent of interactions between ncRNAs and mRNAs varies widely between different species, suggesting that this phenomenon may be subject to selection pressure. By understanding the mechanisms underlying the interactions between ncRNAs and mRNAs, we can better understand how protein expression is regulated within cells, and how these regulations may be disrupted by disease or other external factors.
Early in the course of ALS, motor neurons begin to die. This can be seen as early as 3 months after symptom onset, long before patients develop muscle weakness. Using in vivo imaging of motor neuron axons in SOD1 mice, we show that axonal arbors dismantle asynchronously, with no single NMJ being lost first. Instead, branches are lost one by one in a stepwise manner. Interestingly, branches that are closer to the initial loss are lost before those that are farther away. This phenomenon is likely due to the release of neuronal extracellular material from denervated axons that can activate neighboring motor neurons and promote sprouting of new axonal branches. This suggests that sprouting may be a compensatory mechanism, helping to maintain motor neuron firing as long as possible. However, motor neuron survival in SOD1 mice is not sufficient to maintain firing, as patients with ALS eventually develop muscle weakness. This study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms by which motor neurons die in ALS, as it may lead to the development of new therapies that can slow the progression of the disease.
Tamoxifen is a commonly used drug to treat breast cancer, but it can have negative side effects on the body, including bone loss, hot flashes, and increased risk of blood clots. In this study, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to better understand the effects of tamoxifen on the body at a cellular level. They found that tamoxifen alters the expression of genes involved in bone and fat metabolism, as well as genes involved in thermoregulation. These findings may help researchers better understand the negative side effects of tamoxifen and develop strategies to mitigate them.
Interferon-induced with ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (ISG15) is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) that is highly induced in response to viral infections. Here, the authors report that ISG15 is induced by bacterial infections in vitro and in vivo. They show that the induction of ISG15 by bacteria is independent of interferon signaling and that ISG15 is induced in response to the cytosolic surveillance pathway. Specifically, the authors show that ISG15 is induced by infections with S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, and B. thuringiensis, and that ISG15 induction is independent of interferon signaling. They also show that ISG15 is induced in response to cyclic di-AMP (CDA), a second messenger that is produced in response to the cytosolic surveillance pathway. These findings suggest that ISG15 plays a role in the innate immune response to bacterial infections and that the cytosolic surveillance pathway is involved in this response.
The article presents a new software program called DeepFRET that automates and improves the process of analyzing single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) data. The software uses deep learning algorithms to classify smFRET data into different categories based on the observed fluorescence patterns. The paper describes the methods used to develop the software, including the generation of ground truth data, the design of the deep learning model, and the evaluation of the model's performance. The authors also provide a brief overview of the biological applications of smFRET and how DeepFRET can be used to analyze these data. The article is written in a clear and concise manner, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.
Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a complex of proteins that plays a crucial role in maintaining gene expression patterns during development and adulthood. The complex is composed of four core proteins: enhancer of zeste homologue 1 (Ezh1), enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (Ezh2), suppressor of zeste 12 homologue (Suz12), and retinoblastoma binding protein (Rbbp4/7). PRC2 catalyzes the addition of di- and trimethyl groups to lysine residues of histone H3, which results in the repression of gene expression. The activity of PRC2 is regulated by the cell cycle, DNA damage, and cell differentiation.
Ribosomes are the molecular machines that translate genetic information into proteins. Their structure and function are regulated by a variety of factors, including ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and ribosomal proteins. Recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies have revealed the structures of ribosomes at high resolution, providing a wealth of information on ribosomal structure and function. In this study, the authors used cryo-EM to analyze the structures of ribosomes stalled on SecM, a bacterial protein that causes ribosome stalling by interacting with the ribosomal exit tunnel. They found two main types of stalled ribosomes, one in which SecM is bound to the ribosome at the hybrid rotated state, and another in which SecM is bound to the ribosome at the post-state. They also found that different SecM variants caused ribosomes to stall at different steps of translation. Their work provides a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying ribosome stalling by SecM, and has implications for ribosome biology and protein synthesis.
In this study, we used an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope to measure the number of cones at the foveal center and around it in 21 eyes of 21 subjects with different axial lengths. We found that the number of cones per unit area at the foveal center decreases with increasing axial length, while the number of cones per unit area at a 1-degree eccentricity from the fovea increases with increasing axial length. Our results suggest that the increased sampling resolution of myopes compared to emmetropes may result from a combination of equatorial stretching and overdevelopment of the foveal photoreceptor mosaic.
In this study, the authors used longitudinal swab data from infants in a longitudinal birth cohort in Thailand, along with whole genome sequence data from 2175 pneumococcal positive swabs, to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data. They then combined these results with whole genome sequence data to estimate the overall and relative contributions of pneumococcal genotype to carriage duration, and to identify and quantify the elements of the genome responsible for the variation in carriage duration. The authors found that 63% of the variance in carriage duration could be attributed to pneumococcal genotype, with serotype, drug-resistance, and other significant locus effects being the largest sources of variation in carriage duration. They also identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance.
In this study, the authors investigate the stoichiometry of the IKs (delayed rectifier potassium current) channel complex by using fusion channels and single-channel recordings. They show that while the best-characterized accessory subunit of IKs is KCNE1, it is possible to construct functional IKs channels with 1, 2, or 4 KCNE1 subunits per KCNQ1 tetramer. They also show that a 4:4 stoichiometry of KCNQ1 to KCNE1 maximizes channel conductance. The study provides important information about the structure and function of IKs channels and will contribute to our understanding of how these channels regulate cellular processes.
This study explored the importance of the inflammatory response and the expression of the IL-1β gene in zebrafish during fin regeneration. The researchers found that loss of the il1b gene in zebrafish results in defective fin regeneration, which is characterized by slower healing, altered morphology, and reduced expression of fin regeneration-related genes. The study provides valuable insights into the role of the inflammatory response and IL-1β expression in fin regeneration in zebrafish.
The article discusses the measurement of diffusion coefficients of green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants in three different organisms using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and the derivation of effective diffusion coefficients. The authors show that for Escherichia coli, the highest diffusion coefficient of all GFP variants reflects the free state of GFP. They also show that the diffusion coefficient decreases with net positive charge for all three organisms, suggesting the same cause for slow diffusion in all three organisms. The authors derive an equation for an effective diffusion coefficient based on the observed diffusion coefficients of all GFP variants in each organism. The authors also discuss six assumptions made during the derivation of the equation.
Researchers have found a protein called follistatin that is important for planarian regeneration. Planarians are flatworms that can regenerate almost all their tissues after being cut into pieces. Follistatin is needed for planarians to properly respond to wounds that cause tissue absence, but it is not needed for wounds that do not require regeneration. The researchers also found that two other proteins called activin-1 and activin-2 are needed for follistatin to work properly. Follistatin inhibits these activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence, which is a process important across the animal kingdom.
We sequenced 59 MMR-deficient tumors and identified 1000 distinct recurrent indels in homopolymer regions of 236 EM tumors and 97 CRC tumors. We then used a targeted Sequenom panel to screen for recurrent indels in 114 EM tumors and 97 CRC tumors, and compared our results to IHC data. We found that our 59-marker panel accurately distinguished MSS from MSI tumors, with a Matthew Correlation Coefficient of 0.99. We also analyzed 11 primary endometrial and ovarian tumor cell cultures and found that they had a high prevalence of γH2AX and RAD51 foci. In addition, we treated MCF7 cells with siRNA against ATM, ATR, BRCA1, and BRCA2 genes and found that BRCA2 knockdown significantly reduced cell viability. We also found that olaparib treatment reduced cell viability and increased γH2AX foci in MCF7 cells.
In this paper, we have described the development and characterization of novel optogenetic systems for the specific recruitment of proteins to mitochondria and to other organelles in mammalian cells. We have used the bacterial photoswitch Vivid as a template for engineering a heterodimeric pair of optogenetic proteins, which we have named Magnets. By combining these proteins with membrane-localized photoswitchable fluorescent proteins, we have created systems that allow for the rapid and specific recruitment of proteins to mitochondria and other organelles with high efficiency and precision. Our results demonstrate that the Magnets can be used to study the recruitment and function of proteins at various organelles and to study the dynamics of organelle contacts.

The paper describes a study that aimed to estimate mean height for adults in the 20th century in 200 countries. To do this, the authors collected data from 1472 population-based studies with measurements on over 18 . 6 million adults born between 1896 and 1996. They used a statistical model to estimate trends for all countries and territories, and their findings show that the global average height for men increased by 18 cm and for women by 15 cm over the past century. They also found that the largest increases in height occurred in South Asia and East Asia. The authors highlight that their findings have important implications for understanding the health impacts of childhood and adolescent nutrition and environment on non-communicable diseases in the next generation.
Opioid overdoses are a major health issue, and it is not fully understood why opioids cause such severe respiratory depression. The study by Bachmutsky et al. seeks to understand why opioids cause such severe respiratory depression by identifying the specific neuronal circuits responsible for opioid-induced respiratory depression. The study uses a combination of in vivo electrophysiology, pharmacology, and single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the neuronal circuits involved in opioid-induced respiratory depression. The authors find that two small brainstem nuclei, the preBoTz and PBN/KF, play a critical role in opioid-induced respiratory depression, and that these nuclei are necessary for the development of tolerance to opioid-induced respiratory depression. The study also identifies a small group of neurons in the preBoTz that are necessary for opioid-induced respiratory depression and are not involved in tolerance to this effect. The findings provide new insights into the neuronal circuits involved in opioid-induced respiratory depression, and may have important implications for the development of new therapies for opioid overdoses.
In this study, the authors have performed a series of experiments to investigate the role of sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. They have used a myristoylated peptide that binds specifically to the C-terminal domain of NTCP to identify the receptor for HBV in Tupaia hepatocytes and human liver cells. The authors have shown that the myristoylated peptide is capable of blocking HBV infection in both Tupaia and human liver cells. They have also demonstrated that NTCP is expressed on the surface of human liver cells and is necessary for HBV infection in these cells. The authors have used mass spectrometry to identify specific proteins that interact with the myristoylated peptide and have shown that the C9 domain of NTCP is required for HBV infection. They have also shown that HBV infection is blocked by mutations in the C9 domain that prevent NTCP binding to HBV. Overall, the study provides important insights into the mechanism of HBV infection in liver cells and identifies a potential target for the development of new antiviral therapies.
The immune system's ability to respond to new antigens is crucial for survival. This ability is dependent on the memory CD8+ T cell population, which persist for years after the initial infection and can respond quickly to a secondary infection. However, the immune system of patients with sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response to infection, appears to be impaired. This impairment is characterized by the inability of CD8+ T cells to proliferate in response to a secondary infection, and an increase in CD8+ T cell apoptosis. This study shows that sepsis also causes changes in the composition of the CD8+ T cell population. These changes include a decrease in the proportion of CD8+ T cells that are cytotoxic, and an increase in the proportion of CD8+ T cells that are regulatory. These changes are associated with an increase in inflammatory markers in the plasma, suggesting that they are related to the sepsis syndrome. These changes also persist after sepsis, and are associated with an increased risk of mortality. These findings suggest that sepsis causes long-lasting changes to the immune system, which may contribute to the increased risk of mortality in patients with sepsis.
We have shown that the APOBEC3A deaminase inhibits the retrotransposition of the human-specific mobile element, L1, by deaminating newly synthesized single-stranded L1 DNA that is transiently exposed during the integration process. We have also shown that the uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor, UGI, can block this deamination and increase the efficiency of L1 retrotransposition. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of L1 retrotransposition by APOBEC3A.
The Rem2 gene plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of cortical neurons, but its function in adult neurons is unknown. Using a conditional allele of Rem2, we have found that Rem2 is required for the proper function of adult neurons in the primary visual cortex of the mouse. Specifically, we have found that Rem2 is required for the proper formation of synaptic connections between neurons, and that Rem2 is required for the proper activity of these neurons. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the function of Rem2 and for the development of therapies for neurological disorders that involve synaptic dysfunction.
Scientists have been investigating the effects of magnetic fields on biological cells and molecules. Some researchers have claimed that certain proteins and molecules can sense and respond to magnetic fields. However, other scientists argue that these claims are not supported by experimental evidence and that the laws of physics do not allow for such phenomena. The author of the article suggests that the claims made in the recent papers are likely due to experimental errors or misinterpretations of the results. The author also suggests that future research should take into account the physical laws that govern how magnetic fields interact with matter, as well as the limitations of using magnetic fields to control the activity of biological cells and molecules. Overall, the article provides an interesting perspective on the ongoing debate about the effects of magnetic fields on biological systems.
Stem cells have the ability to reproduce and create new cells. They can also stay in a dormant state, called quiescence, until they are needed again. This study looks at how stem cells switch between these states. The study uses fruit flies to explore this question. The fruit fly's neuroblast cells are similar to human stem cells in many ways. The study found that when the neuroblast cells enter quiescence, a special protein called Prospero can be detected in the nucleus for a short time. This protein helps mark that the cells are preparing to enter quiescence. If Prospero is taken away, the cells cannot enter quiescence. If a small amount of Prospero is added, the cells will enter quiescence. This study suggests that Prospero helps the cells decide whether to enter quiescence or keep dividing. This information could help doctors understand how to make stem cells stay dormant, or how to make them start dividing again.
This manuscript presents an innovative single-molecule fluorescence microscopy (SMFM) assay to investigate the mechanism and kinetics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) uncoating. HIV is a retrovirus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and has remained a major global health threat for decades. The virus enters host cells and integrates its genetic material into the host DNA, where it remains latent and can be reactivated later in the life of the host. HIV uncoating is a critical step in the viral life cycle, as it allows the virus genome to be released into the host cell cytoplasm, where it can then integrate into the host DNA. The SMFM assay allows researchers to investigate the uncoating process in real-time, providing insights into the mechanism of uncoating and the kinetics of the process. This information could have implications for the development of new drugs or therapies that target the uncoating process.
The loss of JNK or MEK in mammary epithelial cells leads to widespread genomic instability and tumorigenesis.
The provided content discusses the role of amidation in ciliogenesis. It describes the identification of a novel and highly conserved signaling or sensory function in eukaryotic cilia, which involves the enzyme peptidyl-aspartate amidotransferase (PAAT). This enzyme is present in the Golgi apparatus and cilia of multiple cell types, and is important for proper ciliary function and structure.
The Myo3 family of proteins are important for the structure of hair cells in the inner ear. These proteins are involved in the formation of stereocilia, which are tiny hair-like structures that help the cell detect sound vibrations. The proteins Myo3 and Espin1 are especially important for stereocilia development. Myo3 proteins are thought to help Espin1 proteins form bundles of actin filaments, which provide the structural support for stereocilia. The authors of this study have found that Myo3 proteins bind to Espin1 proteins in a way that has not been previously described. They have also shown that this binding is important for the development of stereocilia. Overall, this study provides important new insights into the process of stereocilia development.
This article presents a theoretical and computational investigation of the activation and deactivation of the human voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV1.1) based on crystal structures of the channel from bacterial homologs. Using a combination of structural modeling, thermodynamic analysis, and Markov state modeling, the authors explore the mechanisms of channel activation and deactivation, focusing on the role of the gating charge movement in the S4 transmembrane helix and the role of ionic interactions in the voltage sensor domain (VSD). The study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of CaV1.1 activation and deactivation, which can inform future research and the development of therapeutic interventions for various diseases.
The study investigates the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the ability of the adult brain to undergo plastic changes following an injury or learning. The authors found that while MMP inhibition reduced visual plasticity in the healthy brain, it rescued plasticity following a stroke-induced lesion. These findings suggest that an optimal level of MMP activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity and that MMP-inhibition may be beneficial in stroke-induced brain injuries.
AMPA receptors are ion channels found in excitatory synapses in the brain that mediate fast excitatory neurotransmission. These receptors are composed of four subunits that form a tetramer. In the current study, the authors examined the conformation of the extracellular layer of the AMPA receptor, which contains the ligand-binding domains (LBDs). They used a combination of electrophysiological recordings and structural techniques to investigate the dynamics of the LBD layer. The authors found that the open conformation of the LBD layer is favored in desensitized states and that auxiliary subunits restrict the conformational ensemble. These findings provide insights into the conformation of AMPA receptors in synapses.
The authors present a protocol for isolating immune cells from the duodenum of mice with a helminth infection. The authors describe how they improved the standard intestinal digestion protocol to achieve a higher yield of immune cells from infected tissue. They also describe the use of high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry to analyze the cells and validate the success of the isolation protocol. The authors suggest that their new method could be used to study the immune response to helminth infections in more detail.
This study uses mathematical modeling to understand the mechanism of peptide hydrolysis by the 20S proteasome, which is involved in cellular processes such as metabolism, gene expression, protein production and degradation, energy production, DNA replication, and cell division. The authors propose a model that includes five key steps in the proteasomal hydrolysis process: (1) transport of substrates into the proteasome, (2) binding of substrates to active sites, (3) peptide bond hydrolysis, (4) product release from the active site, and (5) product release from the proteasome. The model is based on experimental data obtained using fluorogenic peptides and is validated using additional experimental data. The authors also use the model to identify potential sites of regulation in the proteasome and to suggest potential therapeutic targets.
The recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for maintaining the levels of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, which is important for efficient transmission of signals between neurons. In Drosophila, histamine is a neurotransmitter that is primarily used in the visual system. The study by Xu et al. (2015) identified a new member of the sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter (SNAT) family, BalaT, which is responsible for the transport of β-alanine into photoreceptor cells in the Drosophila visual system. Mutations in BalaT caused a severe deficit in photoreceptor synaptic transmission, phototaxis behavior, and content and retinal distribution of β-alanine. Further studies showed that BalaT is specifically expressed in retinal pigment cells and is required for visual transmission. The authors also identified a new role for retinal pigment cells in the β-alanine recycling pathway. In summary, the study by Xu et al. (2015) provides important insights into the mechanisms of neurotransmitter recycling in the Drosophila visual system, and highlights the role of retinal pigment cells in this process.
This study shows that chronologically aging yeast cells go through a sudden redox collapse that affects over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. The redox collapse is not caused by an increase in endogenous oxidants as previously thought. Instead, it seems to be initiated by a decrease in cellular NADPH, which normally provides the electron source for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. The decrease in NADPH levels occurs very early during lifespan and sets into motion a cascade that eventually leads to the down-regulation of most cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a near-universal lifespan extending measure, increases NADPH levels and delays the onset of the cascade. This study reveals a time line of events leading up to the system-wide oxidation of the proteome days before cell death.
DTD is an enzyme that removes D-amino acids from tRNAs, ensuring that only L-amino acids are incorporated into proteins. In this study, the authors solved the crystal structure of DTD from Plasmodium falciparum (PfDTD) in complex with a non-hydrolyzable analog of D-tyrosine (D-Tyr3AA). The structure revealed that the Gly-cisPro motif is responsible for the enantioselectivity of the enzyme, as it binds the D-amino acid in a chiral conformation. The authors also performed biochemical assays and NMR binding studies to validate the proposed mechanism. This study provides insight into the mechanism of DTD, which is crucial for maintaining homochirality during translation.
The mechanisms of spontaneous gating and ATP-dependent gating of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channels are investigated. It is shown that spontaneous gating of CFTR channels involves NBD dimerization. It is also shown that ATP-dependent gating is due to changes in the strength of interactions between NBDs. The results provide insight into the fundamental mechanism of gating in CFTR channels.
Transmembrane proteins, embedded in a hydrophobic lipid bilayer, often form disordered domains that can interact and affect each other. In this paper, we explored this phenomenon in detail using molecular dynamics simulations. We found that the hydrophobic mismatch between the protein and the lipid bilayer determines the size and shape of these disordered domains. Additionally, the strength of the order-disorder interface between these domains and the surrounding lipid bilayer depends on the hydrophobic mismatch as well. We demonstrated this using two computational tools: (1) a coarse-grained model of the membrane-protein system and (2) a molecular dynamics simulation with explicit water molecules. Our findings have important implications for understanding the behavior of membrane-protein systems in cells, and for the development of new therapeutic approaches that target these systems.
Fluorescence Calcium Imaging and Two-Photon Targeted Electrophysiology in GCaMP6+ and GCaMP6f Neurons.  We analyzed the relationship between AP firing and fluorescence in GCaMP6+ and GCaMP6f neurons. We performed two-photon targeted electrophysiology to record APs and calcium imaging to record fluorescence in GCaMP6+ and GCaMP6f neurons in the visual cortex of transgenic mice. We constructed an AP-calcium fluorescence response curve for individual neurons under conditions with high spike rates and low photon counts. We developed a numerical routine to quality control both electrophysiological and fluorescence movies. Finally, we applied a median filter to the fluorescence traces to smooth them out and made a statistical comparison between the AP firing rate and fluorescence traces.
Researchers from Japan have discovered a complex structure in the female genitalia of a Brazilian cave insect named Neotrogla. The structure is a switching valve that allows the female to switch between two seminal insemination slots while still having a penis-like intromittent organ. This allows the female to compete for seminal gifts from males in their nutrient-poor cave habitats. The researchers used a combination of confocal laser scanning microscopy and synchrotron microcomputed tomography to study the structure and function of the switching valve. They found that the valve has two slots for insemination, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. The researchers also discovered that the semen is consumed by the female as nutrition, and that the switching valve is a morphological novelty that allows the females to compete for seminal gifts. They believe that the evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla. The researchers hope that their findings can help inspire new engineering solutions in fields such as robotics and transportation.
In this study, the authors used single-molecule assays to investigate the stage-wise folding of synaptosomal SNARE complexes and the effects of Munc18-1 on SNARE assembly and membrane fusion. They used an optical tweezers technique to pull single SNARE complexes and measured the extension, force, and trap separation. The authors found that SNARE complexes undergo four distinct stages of folding that can be reversed. They also found that Munc18-1 regulates SNARE assembly by initiating and stabilizing the t-SNARE-VAMP2 complex. Overall, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms of SNARE-mediated membrane fusion.
The integrin adhesome is a complex network of proteins that is assembled at the cell surface when an integrin receptor binds to its extracellular ligand. To understand how diverse cell types can assemble such diverse adhesomes, we need to understand the cytosolic pre-assembly of the integrin adhesome. Here, we report that the integrin adhesome is pre-assembled in a modular fashion in the cytosol. This is done by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) techniques to study the mobility of tagged proteins within the adhesome in real-time. We found that the mobility of proteins within the adhesome is highly restricted, suggesting that they are pre-assembled into complexes. We further showed that integrin adhesomes are assembled in a modular fashion, with each module being composed of a distinct set of proteins. This modular assembly allows for rapid and diverse responses to different cellular signaling cues, and is essential for the function of the integrin adhesome.
This study uses EEG recordings to investigate the relationship between spectral slope, slow wave activity and arousal states. The spectral slope is defined as the logarithmic decrease in power with increasing frequency, and it was found to be higher during anesthesia and sleep compared to wakefulness. The study also found that slow wave activity was lower during anesthesia and wakefulness compared to sleep. These results suggest that the spectral slope and slow wave activity may reflect different aspects of arousal states and that both should be considered when analyzing EEG data.
The paper "Dynamic tubular structures (stromules) in plant epidermal cells" by Caplan et al. presents a comprehensive study of dynamic structures called stromules in plant epidermal cells. The study uses live-cell imaging to characterize these structures and their behavior in response to various treatments and immune responses. The authors observe that stromules are tubular structures extending from chloroplasts and that their organization is affected by microtubule organization. They also find that stromules are important for chloroplast movement during an immune response. The study provides a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of plant cells and the role of stromules in plant physiology.
The study proposes a novel method to predict if two proteins interact. The authors use a pseudo-likelihood approach to identify amino acid residues that are likely to be in contact. They apply this method to a large dataset of known protein complexes and find that residue pairs that are in contact in the three-dimensional structure are highly likely to have covarying residue sequences. They also find that residue pairs that are likely to be in contact are rarely in contact if the proteins do not interact. The authors then use this method to predict if two proteins in an unknown complex interact. They find that the predicted complexes are highly likely to be correct if there are enough aligned sequences and that the accuracy of the predictions increases with the GREMLIN score of the top contact in the complex. They also find that the accuracy of the predictions is more reliable when the top contact is more frequently in contact than the average for a given coupling strength. The authors then use this method to build models of several previously unknown complexes. The authors present the method as a useful tool for predicting if two proteins interact and for building models of previously unknown complexes.
Here we present the full results of a Bayesian active sensor algorithm applied to natural image categorization. The algorithm is based on a probabilistic generative model of natural images and uses a Bayesian inference scheme to select the next fixation that is most likely to provide new information for categorization. The results show that the algorithm is able to capture the complex scanpaths observed in human visual search and that the scanpaths are influenced by the prior knowledge that the human observer has about the world. The algorithm also shows that it is able to provide a good explanation for the variability in scanpaths observed across human observers.
This study aimed to investigate the nuclear transport of large cargoes using a set of capsid-derived model cargoes. The authors designed capsids with varying sizes and number of NLSs and used them as large cargoes to study the size and NLS number dependence of nuclear transport. They found that the nuclear transport of large cargoes is much slower than that of small cargoes and that the number of NLSs needed to achieve efficient transport increases with cargo size. The authors propose a simple physical model to rationalize their results, which predicts that the diffusion of large cargoes through the NPC will be rate-limiting. The study provides new insights into the nuclear transport of large cargoes and can be used as a starting point for understanding the physical constraints of this process.
In this study, the authors show that CD28 expression is required for effector CD4+ T cell responses following infection. They generated a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. They show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4+ T cells following infection; maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract. Together, these findings demonstrate that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming.
Here we present an analysis of the shapes of Helicobacter pylori cells using both light and electron microscopy. We find that cell shapes are consistent with a spherocylinder wrapped around a helical centerline. Using a combination of shape descriptors and geometric enrichment analysis, we identify a subset of cells that have shapes that are consistent with a single helix. We show that the observed helical centerlines are consistent with the centerlines predicted by our model, and that the average major and minor axes of these cells are consistent with the expected dimensions of a single helix. We also observe that the overall shape of the cells is not strongly affected by the mutations I55A or L110S in CcmA, a protein that is essential for helical assembly. Overall, our results provide additional evidence that helical assembly is important for the shape of H. pylori cells.
We have identified a role of Cdc48 in mitochondrial dynamics. Cdc48 negatively regulates Ubp12, which in turn negatively regulates Ubp2, explaining why these two DUBs exert opposite effects on their targets and on ubiquitin homeostasis. We also identify a role for Cdc48 in mitochondrial fusion by controlling the turnover of the Fzo1 protein.
This study compared the visual and auditory processing of sighted and blind individuals by comparing the neural representations of auditory and visual stimuli in the visual cortex of sighted individuals and the auditory cortex of blind individuals. The results showed that the neural representations of visual and auditory stimuli in the visual cortex of sighted individuals were similar to those in the auditory cortex of blind individuals, but the neural representations of visual and auditory stimuli in the auditory cortex of blind individuals were different from those in the visual cortex of sighted individuals. These findings suggest that the auditory cortex of blind individuals may serve as a visual cortex, and that the visual cortex of sighted individuals may serve as an auditory cortex.
The article describes the creation of a draft genome assembly of the fly Musca domestica, also known as the housefly. The assembly is based on Illumina sequencing data and was performed using a variety of bioinformatics tools. The article also describes the process of annotating the genome and assigning genes to it. In addition, the article provides information on the quality of the assembly and some of its potential uses.
RNA processing factors bind to RNA in order to process them. The RNA processing factors do not bind to RNA randomly, but they bind to specific regions or sequences of RNA. The preferences of these RNA processing factors are different and can be measured using cross-linking RNA immunoprecipitation (CLIP) experiments. We used CLIP experiments to measure the preferences of 34 RNA processing factors for RNA binding regions. We used CLIP-Seq data for 11 factors and generated CLIP-Seq data for 23 other factors. We analyzed the binding regions for these 34 factors and classified them into six categories: coding sequence, 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions, introns, snRNAs, snoRNAs, and rRNAs. We found that the factors prefer to bind to specific regions or sequences of RNA, and that their preferences are different for different types of RNA. This information can be used to better understand RNA processing and to identify the function of new RNA processing factors.
This paper proposes a new concept, "kairostatin," which represents a bivalent chromatin formed by H3K27me3 and H3K18ac. The authors found that H3K27me3 and H3K18ac are both enriched in camalexin biosynthesis genes, and mutants defective in H3K27me3 or H3K18ac impair the timely induction of camalexin biosynthetic genes and accumulation of camalexin under FLG22 treatment. The authors propose that kairostatin may be a novel epigenetic mechanism that rapidly activates defense compound biosynthesis in response to a pathogen signal.
In this study, the authors used the brain of a mouse to investigate a type of stem cell called neurogenic astrocytes. These cells are capable of differentiating into neurons and are important for the maintenance of the brain's neural circuits. The authors found that a protein called EZH2 is expressed in neurogenic astrocytes and that it regulates their ability to differentiate into neurons. They also found that EZH2 is important for maintaining the proliferation of these stem cells. The authors used a variety of techniques, including gene knockout and immunohistochemistry, to investigate the function of EZH2 in neurogenic astrocytes. Overall, their findings suggest that EZH2 is an important regulator of the neural stem cell niche in the brain.
Marine viruses are essential for the regulation of oceanic ecosystems and the cycling of nutrients. However, the diversity and abundance of marine viruses are poorly understood, especially in oxygen-depleted environments such as the oxygen minimum zone. In this study, the authors used single-cell genomics to identify viruses that infect SUP05 bacteria, a major denitrifier and sulfate reducer in oxygen-depleted environments. They used a new assembly algorithm called IDBA-UD to assemble 138 SUP05 single-cell genomes and found 36 new viruses belonging to two families, Caudovirales and Microviridae. These viruses are highly abundant in the oxygen minimum zone and have been detected in both freshwater and deep-sea environments. The authors also performed phylogenetic analysis and found that these viruses are closely related to previously sequenced viruses. Finally, they compared the viral and microbial metagenomes and found that viruses are highly abundant in the oceanic virome. This study provides valuable insights into the diversity and abundance of marine viruses in oxygen-depleted environments.
In this article, the authors investigate the role of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein TTC26/DYF13 in the transport of ciliary proteins. IFT proteins are involved in the transport of ciliary proteins and organelles along the length of the cilium. The authors found that TTC26/DYF13 is a bona fide IFT protein that is involved in the transport of specific ciliary proteins. They used a variety of techniques such as confocal microscopy and mass spectrometry to investigate the function of TTC26/DYF13. Overall, the authors provide important insights into the role of IFT proteins in ciliogenesis and maintenance.
Melanoma is a cancer that arises from the pigment-producing cells called melanocytes in the skin. It is the most aggressive form of skin cancer, and its metastatic potential is very high. In the current study, the authors have investigated the role of the MMP14 and NOTCH3 genes in melanoma metastasis using in vitro and in vivo models. The authors have used a novel approach to investigate the role of the MMP14 and NOTCH3 genes by exposing melanoma cells to a layer of LECs in a 3D fibrin matrix. This approach has allowed the authors to investigate the effects of LECs on melanoma cells in a more physiologically relevant way, and to investigate the role of MMP14 and NOTCH3 in this process. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that the MMP14 and NOTCH3 genes play a crucial role in melanoma metastasis, and that they are potential targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies.
This article provides a comprehensive review of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the brain, with a focus on their function in dendritic and synaptic development. The authors discuss the importance of miRNAs in regulating gene expression during these processes, and highlight the various methods used to study miRNA function. They also describe the potential therapeutic applications of miRNAs, including their use in treating neurological disorders. Overall, this article provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in understanding the role of miRNAs in the brain.
This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to examine the relationship between social-communication difficulties and functional brain connectivity in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study found that young children with ASD had weaker connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN) compared to typically developing children. In addition, the study found that children with ASD had weaker connectivity within the DMN and within the DAN compared to typically developing children. These findings suggest that the weaker connectivity between the DMN and the DAN may be related to social-communication difficulties in children with ASD. The study also found that children with ASD who had lower levels of fixation on a geometric stimulus during eye tracking had weaker connectivity between the DMN and the DAN compared to children with ASD who had higher levels of fixation. This finding suggests that social-communication difficulties may be related to reduced fixation on social stimuli during eye tracking. Overall, these findings provide insights into the neural basis of social-communication difficulties in children with ASD.
This study investigates the differentiation of crystal cells in the larva of Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for the study of hematopoiesis. Crystal cells are a type of immune cell that are unique to insects and are thought to have evolved in response to the high levels of parasitism and pathogen exposure in insect environments. This study shows that crystal cells differentiate from prohemocytes in the lymph gland, a hematopoietic organ that produces all types of blood cells. The study also shows that crystal cell differentiation is regulated by the Notch pathway, which is a conserved signaling pathway that regulates cell fate and differentiation in many organisms. The study also shows that crystal cell differentiation is regulated by contact between hemocytes, which is required for Notch activation. The study provides insight into the mechanisms of crystal cell differentiation and suggests that crystal cell differentiation may be regulated by both intracellular and extracellular cues.

We have identified a new group of opsins, the xenopsins, in flatworms and have found that they are expressed in extraocular, ciliary photoreceptors. We have also characterized the phototransduction pathway of one of these xenopsins in vitro, and found that it couples to the Gαi family of G proteins. These findings provide a new perspective on the evolution of animal photoreceptors and the phototransduction pathways that they use.
I was born in the UK and grew up in Canada. I have a PhD in Human Genetics from the University of Toronto, where I studied the evolution of microRNAs and their targets in mammals. I then completed postdoctoral fellowships at the National Institutes of Health, where I worked on developing the Targeted DamID (TaDa) method to identify genomic binding sites of transcription factors, and at the University of California, Berkeley, where I studied the role of Hunchback in neuroblast diversity in Drosophila. I am currently an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Davis, where I have a lab that focuses on the integration of spatial and temporal cues in Drosophila neuroblast lineages. My research aims to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie neuroblast diversity and how this diversity is influenced by spatial and temporal cues. I am particularly interested in how the Hunchback transcription factor is used in Drosophila to integrate these cues.
The study explores the function of the P2X receptor, a protein that binds ATP and forms channels. The researchers used the structures of P2X receptors to create molecular models of the receptor with or without attached MAM molecules. They also used microscopy to observe the effects of MAM on P2X receptor function. The study found that MAM molecules can control the opening and closing of the channels formed by the P2X receptor. The researchers also found that the MAM molecules can affect the sensitivity of the P2X receptor to ATP. Overall, the study suggests that MAM molecules may be useful in controlling P2X receptor function.
The authors conducted a study to investigate the role of formin-1 in regulating the contractile ring during cytokinesis in C. elegans embryos. They found that formin-1 is required for the contraction of the ring, but not for its formation. They also observed that the ring constricts more slowly in embryos that lack formin-1 than in wild-type embryos. The authors suggest that formin-1 plays a role in the coordination of cytokinesis with cell division, and that it may be important for maintaining the shape and size of the ring.
The bacterial species Vibrio fischeri produces a flagellin sheath that contains a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer. This LPS layer is thought to protect the flagellin from the host immune system. However, a recent study has shown that V. fischeri flagellar LPS can trigger apoptosis in the host ciliated cells. This study shows that mutations in the V. fischeri flagellar LPS biosynthesis gene, motB1, reduce the induction of apoptosis in the host ciliated cells. These results suggest that the LPS layer of the flagellar sheath may have a dual role in colonization and immune modulation.
Genome elimination, which occurs in Arabidopsis plants that express different centromere histones H3, is a process that results in extreme chromosomal restructuring. Shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, and analysis of breakpoint junctions suggests that breaks are followed by repair through non-homologous end joining or stalled fork repair. The mutation of required NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery, suggesting that the process is not random but rather the result of certain mechanisms. Furthermore, the heritability and stability of a rearranged chromosome suggest that it may contribute to enduring genomic novelty. These findings provide a previously lacking organismal system to investigate genome instability during mitotic catastrophes and suggest that human diseases resulting from chromosomal rearrangements may be connected to common mechanisms.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human herpesvirus that can cause a range of diseases, including Burkitt lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The EBV-encoded BHRF3 protein is essential for the survival of infected cells. The EBV-encoded BHRF3 protein uses a mitochondrial survival pathway to suppress apoptosis. The EBV-encoded BHRF3 protein also uses a unique mechanism of mitochondrial regulation to maintain survival and proliferation of infected cells.
In this study, the authors analyzed a collection of 797 Arabidopsis (A. thaliana) accessions from Europe to understand the distribution of aliphatic glucosinolate (GSL) chemotypes across the continent. They found that the distribution of chemotypes is influenced by a combination of ecological and demographic factors. Specifically, they found that GSL chemotypes varied depending on the geographical location of the accession, with accessions from the south having higher levels of alkenyl GSLs, while accessions from the north had higher levels of 3-butenyl GSLs. They also found that GSL chemotypes varied depending on the genetic background of the accession, with some accessions having multiple mutations in the same gene, resulting in chemotypes that appear to be independently evolved. These results suggest that GSL chemotypes are influenced by both ecological and genetic factors.
In this study, the authors investigate the role of caspases in the tumor growth of scrib−/− RasV12 cells in Drosophila. They found that oncogenic Ras switches the pro-apoptotic activity of caspases into a tumor-promoting one. They also showed that caspase-induced ROS are essential for the recruitment and activation of hemocytes, which in turn signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to stimulate JNK signaling. These events constitute a feedback amplification loop, which is necessary for neoplastic activity of scrib−/− RasV12 cells. The authors suggest that caspases may be a potential target for cancer therapy.
The study investigates the relationship between social proficiency, oxytocin, and time perception of social interactions. In a series of experiments, the authors manipulated point-light displays of agents interacting with each other to dissociate the perception of social interaction and that of biological motion. They assessed temporal perception of such displays in individuals with varying social proficiency and critically examined the role of oxytocin in this process. The results showed that social proficiency influenced the temporal perception of social interactions and that exogenous manipulations of oxytocin level modulated the effect. These findings suggest that social proficiency, oxytocin, and neural processing of social stimuli are closely linked and that oxytocin plays a crucial role in mediating time perception of social interaction.
The study presented here is focused on understanding the effects of different variants of concern of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, on its interaction with human cells, specifically with the receptor-binding domain of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein. The study used a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the interaction between the Spike RBD of the virus and the ACE2 protein. The study found that the N501Y, E484K, and S477N mutations of the Spike RBD all enhance the binding to ACE2, with N501Y increasing affinity by about 10-fold. On the other hand, the K417N/T mutations, which are present in the South African and Brazilian variants, decrease the affinity. The study also found that mutations of the ACE2 protein, such as S19P and K26R, enhance the interaction with the Spike RBD. The study suggests that mutations of the Spike RBD and ACE2 that enhance their interaction may increase the transmissibility of the virus, while those that decrease the interaction may facilitate immune escape.
In this study, the authors present a large-scale analysis of genetic interactions in Drosophila melanogaster. Using RNA interference (RNAi) screening and automated cell imaging, the authors generate a large dataset of phenotypic features that are used to compute directional genetic interactions, which reveal the logical and temporal dependencies between functional modules. They apply this approach to reveal an epistatic relationship between Ras/MAPK signaling and SWI/SNF regulators of chromatin remodeling. The study provides a new method for large-scale mapping of regulatory relationships in animal cells and demonstrates the power of combinatorial RNAi and automated cell imaging for this purpose. The study also provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in the mechanisms of signaling and chromatin regulation in Drosophila.
The article provides a detailed description of a method used to identify the functional genes involved in S-locus heterostyly in Primula vulgaris. The authors first sequenced and assembled the transcriptome of P . vulgaris flowers, followed by differential gene expression analysis to identify genes differentially expressed in S- and L-morph styles. They then used RT-PCR to confirm the differentially expressed genes, and performed phylogenetic analysis to identify homologs of these genes in other species. Finally, they used RNAi and brassinolide treatment to show that one of the identified genes, CYP734A50, plays a role in style length regulation. The article provides a detailed description of the methods used, making it accessible to researchers in the field who are interested in using similar methods for their own studies.
This article describes a new technique called optogenetics that uses light to control the activity of neurons in the hypothalamus, a region of the brain involved in reproduction. The authors used this technique to study the activity of neurons in the hypothalamus that are responsible for controlling the secretion of hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle. They also studied the effects of different drugs on the activity of these neurons. The authors provide detailed descriptions of the methods they used and the results they obtained. Overall, this article provides important new information about the hypothalamus and its role in regulating the menstrual cycle.
In this manuscript, the authors investigate the role of BMP signaling in the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into neural and mesodermal cell types. The authors show that BMP favors mesodermal differentiation by maintaining high levels of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. The authors also show that BMP prevents differentiation into neural cell types by maintaining E-cadherin levels. The authors provide detailed descriptions of the experiments and methods used in their study.
The mammalian centrosome is a complex microtubule-based organelle that serves as the primary microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) during cell division. This study identifies a new player in the regulation of centrosome assembly and function. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that Cep120, a protein that was previously identified as a cilia-associated protein, is required to maintain the asymmetry of the centrosome. They show that depletion of Cep120 disrupts the localization of pericentrin and Cdk5Rap2, two key centrosomal proteins, leading to the loss of the proximal ends of the centrioles and the formation of aberrant centrioles. They also show that Cep120 plays a role in the recruitment of ninein, a key protein involved in the regulation of centriolar satellite localization. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying centrosome function and suggest that Cep120 may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ciliopathies.
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) integrate into neuronal circuits during the first two postnatal weeks when the inner retina is undergoing robust synaptogenesis. Retinal waves are mediated by cholinergic circuits prior to eye opening and then by glutamatergic signaling. MCs express a complement of receptors that allow detection of neurotransmitters released during retinal waves, resulting in parallel activation of this glial network.
The paper presents a study that used high-throughput DNA sequencing to track changes in microbial communities associated with decomposition of mouse corpses over time. The authors sampled skin sites, the abdominal cavity, and soil from 40 mice that were allowed to decompose on soil for 48 days. They used culture-independent sequencing approaches to identify microbial communities, including bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes. The authors found that microbial community composition and diversity change significantly over time, with distinct communities present at each stage of decomposition. They also observed differences in the microbial communities of skin sites and the abdominal cavity, as well as differences in soil samples taken from the same mouse. The authors propose that these results suggest that microbial community data could be developed into a forensic tool for estimating postmortem interval.
Here, we provide a brief overview of the Hox/PBC/Meis interaction network.
We report on the design, construction, and application of genetically encoded fluorescent sensors that enable super-resolution microscopy of the AMPA and NMDA receptors in live neurons. We use monomeric streptavidin (mSA) that binds to streptavidin-coated quantum dots (qdots) to label the receptors. We also develop a method for super-resolution microscopy using fluorescence photon counting (fPALM). We use this method to visualize the post-synaptic density (PSD) and AMPA/NMDA receptor super-resolution trajectories in live neurons. Our fPALM method provides a new tool for studying the dynamics of synaptic receptors in living cells.
This is a scientific article about how the first response of neurons to an early nerve stimulus is regulated by the SUMO pathway. It reports that SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels plays a key role in regulating this response, which involves a shift in the activation voltage of the channels from negative to positive. The authors show that this regulation is due to a direct interaction between SUMO1 and NaV1.2 channels at the plasma membrane, which is mediated by a single mono-SUMOylation event on a specific lysine residue of NaV1.2. They provide evidence for this by using various techniques such as electrophysiology, immunofluorescence, and in vitro SUMOylation assays. The article also discusses the potential clinical implications of this regulation, as abnormal SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels has been linked to epilepsy and other neurological disorders.
Ross River virus (RRV) is a mosquito-borne disease that is endemic in Australia and can cause severe symptoms such as fever, rash, arthritis, and fatigue. The full R0 model, which was developed to understand how different factors such as temperature, mosquito population density, and host immunity affect the transmission potential of RRV, was compared with a simpler constant M model that does not consider the effect of temperature on mosquito density. The results showed that temperature plays a crucial role in the transmission potential of RRV, and that factors such as mosquito population density and host immunity also have a significant impact. The model also highlighted the importance of considering the different thermal responses of mosquito life history traits such as biting rate, development rate, and lifespan when predicting RRV transmission. Overall, the study demonstrated the importance of considering multiple factors, including temperature, when predicting mosquito-borne disease transmission.
How can we identify the brain signals associated with the manipulation of a particular behavior? To answer this question, we recorded electrophysiological data from neurons in a macaque monkey's brain while it performed a task that involved reaching for an object. We then analyzed the data to find patterns of activity that were associated with specific stages of the task, such as reaching and grasping. We found that the neural signals associated with different stages of the task were distinct and could be used to predict the performance of the task. These findings provide insights into how the brain controls complex behavior and could be used to develop new interventions for neurological disorders.
The function of TRAF2 in TNF signaling in different tissues has not been well established. This study found that TRAF2 is required for full strength TNF signaling in MDFs, keratinocytes, and some T cells. The study also found that TRAF2 and SPHK1 play different roles in TNF signaling. Specifically, the study found that TRAF2 is required for full strength TNF signaling, while SPHK1 is required for the activation of JNK1/2. The study also found that TRAF2 and SPHK1 play different roles in regulating inflammation in keratinocytes. The study found that TRAF2 is required for the resolution of psoriasis-like inflammation, while SPHK1 is not. The study suggests that TRAF2 and SPHK1 play different roles in TNF signaling and regulating inflammation.
Scientists have found that a protein called dynamin is not needed for the process of recycling damaged vesicles at the synapses of neurons. This discovery challenges previous research, which had suggested that dynamin played a key role in the recycling process.
This study used an integrated multi-omic approach to identify biomarkers of glucocorticoid (GC) action. The authors used a within-individual design to compare physiological GC exposure and GC withdrawal in patients with Addison's disease. The study included gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, circulating miRNAs, and metabolites. The study identified a multi-omic pattern related to GC action in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue. The authors replicated these findings in independent study groups with different GC exposure. This study provides a novel approach to identifying biomarkers of GC action and could potentially inform the development of new GC treatments.
The researchers used fluorescence imaging to monitor the spatial and temporal dynamics of mTORC1 activation. They discovered that the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes is a transient event and occurs within 2 minutes of amino acid addition. The RAGULATOR complex is responsible for sensing amino acids and activating mTORC1 in the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane. The researchers also found that the active form of mTORC1 is present on the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane in response to amino acids. They found that the amino acid-dependent activation of mTORC1 is mediated by RAGULATOR and is sensitive to the vacuolar ATPase. The researchers further demonstrated that the primary amino acid sensors are located inside the cell and suggested a model that combines both internal and external sensing. They concluded that amino acids trigger mTORC1 activation by causing the translocation of the kinase from the cytosol to the late endosomal/lysosomal membrane.
In this study, we investigated the impact of the modification of antigens on the routing of antigens to specific receptors and the subsequent cross-presentation of antigens by dendritic cells. We found that the modification of OVA by conjugating the carbohydrate structure LeX to OVA re-directed the antigen to the CLR MGL1, resulting in an enhanced cross-presentation of antigens by DCs and enhanced CD8+ T cell priming. This was accompanied by a skewing of CD4+ T cells towards a Th1 profile. We also found that the MGL1 pathway of antigen presentation was independent of the presence of TAP1 and TLR signaling, and that the antigen was routed to Rab11+LAMP1+ vesicles, suggesting that the MGL1 pathway of antigen presentation may be responsible for the enhanced cross-presentation of antigens. Overall, our findings suggest that the modification of antigens can have a significant impact on the routing of antigens to specific receptors and the subsequent cross-presentation of antigens by DCs.
This paper is about the role of type six secretion (T6S) systems in regulating quorum sensing (QS) in bacteria. QS is a process by which bacteria coordinate their behavior by responding to chemical signals produced by other bacteria. T6S systems are secretion systems that bacteria use to deliver toxins and other proteins to other cells. This paper shows that T6S systems can be used to regulate QS in bacteria by controlling the production of toxins. The paper also shows that T6S can be used to control the spread of QS mutants in a population. This finding has important implications for understanding how bacteria control their behavior and how they interact with each other in populations.
The brains of newborns have a unique way of communicating with each other. This communication happens through oscillations, which are like rhythmic patterns of electrical activity that happen in the brain. These oscillations have been observed in the brains of newborns, but it is not yet clear what they are for and how they work. One theory is that these oscillations help the different parts of the brain to talk to each other and work together as a team.
This study provides evidence that chromatin remodelling factor RNAPII is highly regulated by multiple modifications at the CTD region and that these modifications have a strong influence on its association with specific genes. The authors used a large RNA-seq dataset of human ES cells to identify four distinct groups of RNAPII-associated genes that are characterized by a particular combination of modifications. These groups are highly correlated with each other and with gene expression levels, and the authors propose a simple model that explains how the different modifications contribute to the binding of RNAPII to specific genes. The study is the first to provide a detailed quantitative characterization of the binding of RNAPII to genes in a large dataset, and it has important implications for the understanding of how chromatin structure influences gene expression.
Skeletal muscle stem cells are activated by injury and are important for muscle repair and regeneration. They are in a quiescent state in their niche, but are activated upon injury. In this study, we identified genes that are up-regulated in activated muscle stem cells and found that the RNA binding protein TTP is one of them. TTP is a post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression that binds to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). TTP promotes the degradation of ARE-containing mRNAs, so its up-regulation in activated muscle stem cells may lead to down-regulation of certain target genes. We found that TTP is phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in activated muscle stem cells and that phosphorylation of TTP regulates its binding to target mRNAs. Therefore, phosphorylation of TTP may regulate the down-regulation of target genes, which is important for the activation of muscle stem cells.
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders that affect the gastrointestinal tract, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both IBDs are associated with genetic mutations, environmental factors, and the microbiome. The microbiome plays a crucial role in IBD development by modulating the immune response. This study investigates the role of IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) in the development of intestinal inflammation in infants with IBD. IL-10R is expressed in immune cells, including macrophages, and plays a crucial role in regulating immune responses. Previous studies have shown that IL-10R is essential for macrophage function and survival. In this study, the authors used Il10rb-/- mice, which lack the IL-10Rβ chain, to investigate the role of IL-10R in the development of colitis. They found that IL-10R deficiency led to colitis development in infancy, and that clodronate-treated mice exhibited a reduction in the accumulation of macrophages in the lamina propria of the colon. The authors also found that mice lacking IL-10R showed a defect in the differentiation of anti-inflammatory macrophages. This study provides important insights into the role of IL-10R in the development of colitis in infants.
This article describes a screen of ~1,000 Tudor domain-containing genes in C. elegans for defects in the piRNA pathway, which is involved in RNA-mediated gene silencing. The authors found that one gene, simr-1, is required for piRNA-dependent gene silencing and is involved in a novel step in the piRNA pathway upstream of piRNA amplification. They also identified several other genes that are required for piRNA amplification and found that the piRNA pathway is required for oogenesis and spermatogenesis in C. elegans.
Purkinje cells in larval zebrafish show bistability in vivo, meaning they can exist in two different states and switch between them spontaneously or in response to electrical stimulation. This behavior is driven by climbing fiber inputs and is not dependent on GABA or NMDA receptor activity. The finding that bistability is present in larval Purkinje cells suggests that this property may be present in mammalian Purkinje cells as well, but further research is needed to confirm this.
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a key cellular process for internalizing nutrients, receptors, and viruses. A minimal branched actin network consisting of ~200 active Arp2/3 complex molecules is sufficient to internalize ~100 nm diameter protein cages. Actin forces are necessary to overcome membrane tension for endocytosis. The actin forces are generated by a small number of Arp2/3 complexes that form near the clathrin coat. The bending and internalization of the clathrin coat is the rate-limiting step for endocytosis.
We found that actin-based macropinocytic cups form from a ring of coincident intense patches of PIP3, active Ras and active Rac at their periphery. These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery. We propose that macropinocytic cups form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3 that recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery.
Scc2 and Scc4 are cohesin loading proteins. Scc4 contacts a conserved patch on Scc2 to determine its localization.
Garden dormice (Eucomys chrysomelas) experience delayed body growth during the first part of the juvenile period, when the season is cold. Juvenile dormice from early-born litters tend to have more fat mass and are less active during the pre-hibernation phase than juveniles from late-born litters. Pre-hibernation activity is a predictor of body mass and fat mass at emergence from hibernation. Juvenile dormice have a strong seasonal rhythm of body growth, activity and hibernation, which is triggered by the shortening of daylight. The body mass gain of juvenile dormice from early-born litters is lower than that of juveniles from late-born litters, but the rate of body mass gain is the same. The activity of juveniles from early-born litters is lower than that of juveniles from late-born litters during the pre-hibernation period. Juvenile dormice from late-born litters have a higher body mass and fat mass at emergence from hibernation than juveniles from early-born litters. The seasonal timing of hibernation depends on the age and body mass of juvenile dormice. The seasonal timing of hibernation in juveniles from late-born litters is delayed compared to juveniles from early-born litters. The late-born juveniles are more active during the pre-hibernation period than the early-born juveniles. The seasonal timing of hibernation is influenced by the day length, but the rate of body mass gain is not affected by day length. Juvenile dormice are capable of compensating for the lack of growth during the cold season by growing more rapidly in the warm season. The seasonal timing of hibernation is predictable for juvenile dormice, and this predictability depends on the age and body mass of juvenile dormice. Juvenile dormice are capable of adjusting their seasonal timing of hibernation to match changes in day length, and the timing of hibernation can be used as an indicator of juvenile age and body mass. The juvenile period of garden dormice lasts from birth to emergence from hibernation. The juvenile period is divided into three phases: early growing period, late growing period, and pre-hibernation phase. The seasonal rhythm of body mass gain, activity, and hibernation is influenced by the seasonal changes in day length. The pre-hibernation period lasts for 4 weeks, and the hibernation period lasts for 8 weeks. The seasonal timing of hibernation depends on the juvenile age and body mass, and the timing of hibernation is predictable for juvenile dormice.
We provide information about the impact of Adeno-Related DNA (ADR) 1 and 2 genes on chemotaxis in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm. ADR-1 and -2 encode enzymes that modify adenosine residues in RNA, and loss of function of these genes results in decreased chemotaxis in worms. The study identifies specific target RNAs that are modified by ADR-1 and -2 and are required for normal chemotaxis, including a novel role for ADR-2 in regulating translation. The study also provides a method for unbiased identification of edited RNA targets in worms, which may be applied to other systems to identify new targets of RNA modification. The findings of this study may have implications for understanding the role of RNA modification in neuronal function and the development of RNA modification-based therapies for neurodegenerative diseases.
In this study, the authors used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the mechanisms that are being utilized by the Influenza A virus (IAV) to induce host shutoff. They show that IAV transcripts are not preferentially translated, and instead the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover on the mRNA pool. Their measurements also uncover strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction, revealing that short transcripts are less affected by IAV. Interestingly, these mRNAs that are refractory to IAV infection are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, they show that the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. Overall, the study advances our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggests a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.
How do cells use signals to communicate with each other and coordinate their activities to form tissues and organs? This study examines the signaling protein FGF and its role in tissue morphogenesis using the example of the Drosophila tracheal system. The authors use genetically encoded versions of the FGF and its receptor to visualize the distribution of the signaling molecule and its response in living cells. They find that FGF moves from its source to its target cells through specialized filopodia-like structures called cytonemes. These structures not only transport the signaling molecule but also help to shape its concentration gradient. The authors also find that FGF signaling is self-regulated by cytoneme-mediated feedback. Together, these findings provide a new understanding of how signaling proteins can be transported and regulated in space and time to mediate tissue morphogenesis.
We have determined the crystal structure of 10 different coiled-coil proteins that contain 2 or 3 residue insertions and/or 1 or 2 residue deletions. The coiled-coil region of all structures adopts a 3/1 helix with a pitch of 1.4 nm and a twist of 60°, corresponding to a typical α-helical conformation. The insertions and/or deletions in the coiled-coil region lead to the formation of additional secondary structure elements, such as β-strands and β-hairpins, that stabilize the assembly. We also report a novel structure of a coiled-coil protein that contains an additional β-sheet and forms a parallel β-sheet dimer. Our results provide insights into the diverse ways in which coiled-coil proteins can be structured and suggest that a wide range of proteins can be modeled as coiled-coil dimers.
The authors investigate the function of the epsin proteins, which are required for clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) formation and for linking the CCVs to the cortical actin network. They generated a mouse line with a null mutation in all three epsin genes. Using this mouse line, they show that epsins are essential for CCV formation in vitro and in vivo, and that they are required for normal actin cortex organization and for correct synaptic vesicle trafficking at neuronal synapses. They also show that the Hip1 and Hip1R proteins, which are required for CCV formation in yeast, are dispensable for this function in mammals. These data suggest that the mechanisms of CCV formation and actin cortex organization are different in yeast and mammals.
Asthma is a common condition that affects children and adults around the world. In Africa, it is not known what causes asthma to develop. In this study, researchers wanted to learn more about the factors that might be associated with asthma in children in Uganda. To do this, they conducted a study among 555 children with asthma and 1115 children who did not have asthma. The children were between 5 and 17 years old and lived in Entebbe, a town in Uganda. The researchers asked parents and children about various factors that might be associated with asthma, including area of residence, parental education, parental history of asthma, allergic conditions, and cooking on gas or electricity. They also tested the children for allergens and performed other medical tests. The researchers found that children born in towns or cities had a higher risk of asthma than children born in rural areas. They also found that children of parents with higher education levels were more likely to have asthma. The researchers concluded that asthma is associated with an increased risk of a rural-town-city gradient, higher parental socioeconomic status, and urbanicity. This information will help researchers identify specific environmental and lifestyle factors that may cause asthma in children in Africa.
The article describes the discovery of a new gene in zebrafish called "luchs" that is responsible for the formation of the alternating light and dark stripes on the fish's body and fins. The authors used genetic and molecular techniques to identify the gene and to show that it codes for a connexin protein that forms gap junctions between cells. They also showed that the luchs gene is required for the communication between melanophores and xanthophores to form the stripe pattern. The article is written in a clear and concise way that is accessible to a general audience.
Scientists have studied the sense of smell in different animals to understand how they detect chemicals in their environment. The sense of smell is very important because it helps animals find food, avoid danger, and find mates. Insects have a special type of receptor called the olfactory receptor (OR) that helps them detect chemicals in their environment. The scientists want to understand more about how ORs evolved in different insects and how they work. They studied different types of insects and found that some insects have a completely different type of receptor called the coreceptor (Orco) that works with ORs. They also found that the receptors in different insects are different, meaning they have different sequences of proteins. This is because the receptors in different insects have evolved differently. The scientists also used images from a microscope to look at the shape of the receptors in different insects. They found that the receptors in different insects have different shapes. They think that this is because the receptors have evolved differently in different insects. Overall, this study shows that insects have a special type of receptor called the olfactory receptor (OR) that helps them detect chemicals in their environment. The scientists want to understand more about how ORs evolved in different insects and how they work. They found that some insects have a completely different type of receptor called the coreceptor (Orco) that works with ORs. They also found that the receptors in different insects are different, meaning they have different sequences of proteins. This is because the receptors in different insects have evolved differently. The scientists also used images from a microscope to look at the shape of the receptors in different insects. They found that the receptors in different insects have different shapes. They think that this is because the receptors have evolved differently in different insects.
The study aimed to examine the effects of mass drug administration (MDA) for malaria elimination in four villages in Myanmar. The study found that low MDA adherence was associated with a 2.85 times higher risk of post-MDA malaria episodes compared to high adherence. Other risk factors for malaria included having a mosquito bite, living in a house with someone who had malaria, and having an asymptomatic malaria infection. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, may frustrate elimination efforts.
In this study, the authors determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs and compared them to human and mouse data. They found that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.
In this article, the authors present a stepwise protocol to differentiate human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into both mesodermal and endodermal progenitors simultaneously. The protocol uses small molecules to regulate the signaling pathways that control lineage specification and differentiation. The authors demonstrate that their protocol can be used to generate both cardiac and lung progenitors from hiPSCs, which can further differentiate into cardiomyocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, respectively. They also show that the cardiac progenitors can support the differentiation of lung progenitors and vice versa, suggesting a possible mechanism for the close relationship between the heart and lungs during development. Overall, the authors' protocol provides a valuable tool for studying the developmental interactions between different lineages of cells in the heart and lungs.
The study aimed to investigate the effect of ethanol on E. coli and its adaptation to near-lethal ethanol concentrations. The authors found that ethanol exposure can lead to mutation accumulation in several genes involved in replication and repair. They also observed that some mutations can confer ethanol resistance and, therefore, contribute to adaptation to ethanol stress. Additionally, the authors found that the evolution of ethanol tolerance can be described by an initial rapid increase in ethanol tolerance followed by a slower increase until a plateau was reached. The study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation to stressful environments.
We generated a tool for performing BiFC-based protein interaction analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana. To this end, we used the N-terminal VENUS and the C-terminal CFP fusion tags, which are required for BiFC analysis. We found that the CFP-tagged bZIP63 efficiently interacts with the N-terminally tagged bZIP1, bZIP11, and AKIN10, but not with AKIN11 or the N-terminally tagged AKIN10.
Synaptic plasticity requires the participation of several proteins. In this study, we identified a novel protein, RNF10, which interacts with GluN2A subunit of NMDARs at the PSD. We demonstrated that RNF10 is involved in LTD by interacting with importin alpha, a protein implicated in the trafficking of proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. We also showed that RNF10 is regulated by LTD, and that its downregulation impairs LTD. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.
This study reports the first crystal structure of Mot1, a member of the Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase (SWR) family of ATPases that modulate chromatin remodeling complexes. The authors used the negative-stain EM to first obtain a low-resolution structure of the Mot1:TBP:DNA:NC2 complex, followed by molecular replacement with the NF-Y complex as a template to obtain a higher resolution structure. The authors then used this high-resolution structure to study the details of the Mot1-TBP interaction, including its C-terminal domain, and the flexibility of the protein. They also used this structure to identify a putative regulatory domain in the C-terminal region of the protein that is conserved in the SWR family of ATPases. Overall, this study provides a significant contribution to our understanding of the SWR family of ATPases and their mechanisms of action.
In this study, the authors designed new synthetic variants of ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product whose molecular mode of action was unknown. The new ternatin variants are cytotoxic toward cancer cells, with up to 500-fold greater potency than ternatin itself. Using a ternatin photo-affinity probe, the authors identified the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex (eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA) as a specific target and demonstrated competitive binding by the unrelated natural products didemnin and cytotrienin. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation. The authors concluded that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products.
This article is a scientific paper that investigates the role of a protein called OCRL in endocytosis and its involvement in Lowe syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. The authors used a combination of imaging and biochemical techniques to analyze the behavior of OCRL in cells, and to examine its interactions with other proteins. They found that OCRL is involved in the formation of endocytic structures, and that it interacts with several other proteins that are also involved in endocytosis. The authors suggest that OCRL plays a key role in the pathogenesis of Lowe syndrome, and that it may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
In colorectal cancer, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is often active, leading to tumor growth. This activation occurs when a protein called APC is missing or not working properly, which means that another protein called GSK3β does not work properly either. This leads to the accumulation of β-catenin, which is a protein that helps tumors grow. Researchers have found that two other proteins called FAK and PYK2 work with GSK3β to help activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. They also found that when FAK and PYK2 are not working, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway does not work properly and there are fewer tumors.
The neural control of transitions between different postures and movements is important for daily life, but the mechanisms underlying this control are not well understood. This study used electrical vestibular stimulation to investigate the neural control of transitions from standing to walking and from one standing posture to another. The results suggest that the vestibular system may play a role in the control of these transitions, and that the control may involve a disengagement of the current control policy and the engagement of a new one. These findings may have implications for the treatment of movement disorders that involve transitions between different postures and movements.
Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria found in various environments, including freshwater systems and soil. They are an important source of biomass and biofuel, as well as a potential source of medicinal compounds. However, cyanobacterial blooms can be harmful to ecosystems and human health, causing eutrophication of water bodies and producing toxins. The transcriptional regulator RpaA controls global mRNA oscillations in cyanobacteria, which is an important process for photoadaptation and acclimation to fluctuating light conditions.
Cobalt is a transition metal that is essential for the functioning of the human body. However, when it is present in high concentrations, it can be toxic. The PIB-ATPase family of proteins are responsible for the transport of cobalt and other metals across cellular membranes. In this study, the authors have solved the crystal structures of two members of this family, E2-AlF4− and E2-BeF3−, from the bacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus. They have used these structures to study the transport mechanism of these proteins and to identify a dual role of the conserved histidine residue H657, which is involved in both the transport of cobalt as a metal ion and its release as a ligand. The authors have also identified a novel role of E2-AlF4− and E2-BeF3− as cobalt-binding proteins.
In mammals, some genes are expressed from only one of the two copies of a particular gene in each cell. This is known as monoallelic expression (MAE) and is observed in a variety of human diseases. In this study, the authors present a new method for detecting MAE in human cells using a unique chromatin signature. The signature involves the co-occurrence of both active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) chromatin marks in the gene body. The authors find that the signature is present in approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Furthermore, they find that the signature is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. This new approach to detecting MAE is independent of polymorphisms and suggests that MAE may be linked to cell differentiation.
The ClpC protein is a bacterial protease that is essential for virulence and stress resistance. It forms a complex with the peptidase ClpP, which degrades proteins and is activated by the adapter protein MecA. However, ClpC is repressed in its ground state and must be activated to degrade proteins. The authors have determined the cryo-EM structures of ClpC in the presence and absence of MecA to understand how ClpC is repressed and activated. They found that ClpC forms large two-helical assemblies that associate via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains (MDs). MecA converts this resting state to an active planar ring structure by binding to MD interaction sites. The authors also found that repression of ClpC in its ground state is crucial to its mode of action. Loss of repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. This regulatory concept executed by coiled-coil MDs is a novel and unexpected mechanism for tightly controlling AAA+ chaperone activity. The authors' findings unravel a new regulatory concept executed by coiled-coil MDs to tightly control AAA+ chaperone activity.
In this study, the authors followed the behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs) in Drosophila melanogaster and found that AMPs make contact with neighboring muscles. The authors then used genetic analyses to show that muscles release dInsulin ligand and activate the Insulin pathway in neighboring AMPs. This leads to Notch pathway activation, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. The authors suggest that muscle cells play a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs, and that this process is conserved in vertebrates.
In this study, the authors used single-cell RNA sequencing to identify ion channels that are consistently expressed in neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). They found that the Nalcn gene, which encodes a voltage-dependent sodium channel, is consistently expressed in SNr neurons. They also found that the Trpm7 gene, which encodes a member of the transient receptor potential melastatin family of ion channels, is consistently expressed in SNr neurons. The authors then used whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology to study the function of Nalcn and Trpm7 in SNr neurons. They found that Nalcn is responsible for the sustained depolarization that SNr neurons exhibit and that Trpm7 is not functional in these neurons. These findings provide new insights into the ionic mechanisms underlying the firing of SNr neurons.
In this work, we explored the use of microfluidic droplets containing surfactant oil for high-throughput screening of antibiotic activity against soil organisms. The droplets were generated by perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsification in a microfluidic chip, where bacteria and other organisms are grown and the antibiotic activity can be assessed. We compared the performance of this droplet-based method to the traditional plate-based method using agar media and found that the droplet-based method is more efficient and allows for higher throughput. We also demonstrated the use of this method for screening of antibiotic activity against complex soil communities, which are difficult to study using traditional methods. Overall, our work highlights the potential of droplet-based microfluidics for high-throughput screening of antibiotic activity against complex microbial communities.
Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, and can be fatal. A genetic test can help doctors determine if a person is more likely to benefit from or be harmed by treatment with steroids. A study found that people with the genetic test positive for a variant in the LTA4H gene had a higher chance of survival if they received steroids. Another study did not find this benefit. However, when both studies were analyzed together using a Bayesian method, the results showed that people with the genetic test positive for the LTA4H variant had a better chance of survival, no matter what severity of the disease they had. The study recommends that the genetic test should be used to guide steroid treatment decisions.
We have shown that shootin1a plays an important role in the guidance of spinal commissural axons during embryonic development. Shootin1a knockout mice exhibit defective spinal commissural axon guidance, which is similar to the phenotypes observed in mice lacking the Netrin1 ligand or its receptor, DCC. Furthermore, we have shown that shootin1a is required for Netrin1-induced turning of growth cones. In addition, we have demonstrated that shootin1a regulates the interaction between L1-CAM and its ligand, Sema3A, which is important for Netrin1-mediated axon guidance. These results indicate that shootin1a is a key player in Netrin1-mediated axon guidance during embryonic development.
Hummingbirds make a distinct humming sound, but how their wings create this sound is not well understood. In this study, researchers used microphones and force sensors to record and analyze the forces and sound created by hummingbirds as they hover. They found that the hummingbirds create sound by producing forces on their wings that oscillate at their wingbeat frequency. They also found that the size and shape of the hummingbirds' wings affect the sound they create. Their results provide insight into how different bird species may produce sound during flight.
This study used phage-assisted evolutionary engineering to evolve the BCL-2 family of apoptotic regulator proteins. The authors first designed a new vector system that allowed for the co-expression of three different genes within a single plasmid. They then used this new system to perform phage-assisted evolution of hsBCL-2, hsMCL-1, and ancestral versions of the protein. The authors found that phage-assisted evolution allowed for the evolution of novel BCL-2 family proteins with increased NOXA and BID binding affinity. These results demonstrate the utility of phage-assisted evolution in evolving apoptotic regulatory proteins.
The study describes a comprehensive analysis of the genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa, based on the comparison of common SNPs across different ethnic groups. The study shows that the continent has experienced a long history of gene flow between different populations, with evidence of both recent and ancient admixture events. The study also highlights the importance of taking into account the fine-scale structure of African populations, which can be differentiated based on their shared ancestry. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding the genetic basis of diseases in Africa and for the development of personalized medicine.
The paper discusses the role of the spindle in dividing cells during embryogenesis. The authors use a new embryo extract system to study the relationship between spindle size and cell size in Xenopus laevis embryos. They found that spindle size is regulated by the microtubule-destabilizing kinesin kif2a, which is inhibited by the transport receptor importin α. They also found that increasing spindle size impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. The authors concluded that spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism that controls microtubule destabilization.
We found that a type of RNA molecule known as a riboswitch that regulates gene expression in response to specific metabolite ligands can recognize and bind to two different kinds of ligands: one that is related to purine metabolism, and another that is related to energy metabolism. We named the type of riboswitch that recognizes the purine ligand PRPP (5-phospho-α-D-ribose 1-diphosphate) and the type that recognizes the energy ligand ppGpp (5-triphosphate) GPRPP (guanosine 5'-phosphate-4-triphosphate). We showed that the GPRPP riboswitch is present in bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes, and that it is associated with genes involved in energy metabolism. We found that the GPRPP riboswitch and the PRPP riboswitch function in concert as a two-input molecular logic gate, where binding of the energy ligand to the GPRPP riboswitch precludes binding of the purine ligand to the PRPP riboswitch, which results in increased expression of genes involved in energy metabolism.
The article provides a detailed explanation of how the release of neurotransmitters from the presynaptic terminal is regulated. The authors explain the concept of multivesicular release, which is the release of multiple vesicles from the same active zone of a presynaptic terminal. They then provide a detailed description of how the release of neurotransmitters is regulated by the phosphorylation of synapsins, which are proteins that are involved in the control of the number of release sites. The article also describes the use of mathematical models to understand the molecular mechanisms that control release. Finally, the article provides a detailed explanation of the methods used to measure the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals.
HIV-1 Gag encapsulates the viral genome while assembling on the plasma membrane. We reconstituted this process in a minimal system using giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), recombinant myristoylated HIV-1 Gag and purified RNAs. Gag assembles on GUV membranes and selectively packages the HIV-1 5’UTR at subnanomolar concentrations in the presence of excess competitor RNA. We find that the RNA selectivity of Gag is abolished by mutations that subtly affect its ability to cluster on a membrane. Using SHAPE analysis, we find that membrane recruitment of the 5’UTR by Gag does not lead to drastic changes in its secondary structure. We further demonstrate that the association of soluble Gag with tRNA confers additional RNA packaging selectivity.
