      "    Lay summary of abstract: [/INST] Acylation of various carbohydrates is a common phenomenon observed across all domains of life and is facilitated by a variety of protein structures. However, the structure and mechanism of such acyltransferases have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly in the case of bacterial O-antigen modifying acetyltransferase, OafB. This study employed evolutionary co-variance analysis to construct a computational model of the structure of OafB, which exhibits a novel fold for the AT3 domain. Molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to demonstrate the stability of the AT3 domain within the membrane. The AT3 domain features ten transmembrane helices, forming a large cytoplasmic cavity, and is proposed to present the acetyl group close to the likely catalytic residues on the extracytoplasmic surface via a pore created by the movement of an important loop capping the inner cavity. Additionally, limited but significant interactions with the fused SGNH domain are identified, and modelling suggests this domain may be mobile and capable of accepting acyl-groups from the AT3 and subsequently reaching acceptor substrates. Consequently, this new general model of AT3 function provides a framework for the development of inhibitors that could abrogate critical functions of bacterial pathogens.</s>\n"

      "    Lay summary of abstract: [/INST] The acetylation of various carbohydrates is a common process observed across all domains of life. This process can be catalyzed by proteins containing a membrane-bound acyltransferase-3 (AT3) domain (PF01757). However, the structure and mechanism of these proteins remain largely unknown, particularly in the context of bacterial O-antigen modifying acetyltransferases such as OafB. To address this gap, a computational model of the structure of OafB was developed using evolutionary co-variance analysis. The resulting structure exhibits a novel fold for the AT3 domain, which was further validated through molecular dynamics simulations demonstrating its stability in the membrane. The AT3 domain contains 10 transmembrane helices arranged to form a large cytoplasmic cavity lined by residues known to be essential for function. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the acyl-CoA donor spans the membrane through accessing a pore created by movement of an important loop capping the inner cavity, enabling OafB to present the acetyl group close to the likely catalytic residues on the extracytoplasmic surface. Limited but important interactions with the fused SGNH domain in OafB were also identified, and modeling suggests this domain is mobile and can both accept acyl-groups from the AT3 and then reach beyond the membrane to reach acceptor substrates.

To learn more about them, researchers used a special computer program to create a model of what the protein might look like based on its genetic code. They then used another computer program to simulate what might happen when the protein interacts with other molecules. The results showed that the protein has a unique shape and that it may work by allowing acyl groups to pass through a hole in the middle of the protein. This allows the protein to add acyl groups to other molecules on the outside of the cell. Researchers also found that the protein works together with another type of protein called SGNH, which helps to find molecules to add acyl groups to. Overall, this research provides a better understanding of how these important proteins work and could help scientists develop new ways to fight bacterial infections.</s>\n",

      "    Lay summary of abstract: [/INST] This study presents a computational model of the structure of a bacterial protein called OafB. OafB is responsible for adding an acetyl group to certain sugars found in the cell wall of bacteria. The researchers used a technique called evolutionary co-variance analysis to create a model of OafB's structure. They also performed molecular dynamics simulations to test the stability of the model in the membrane. The results showed that OafB has a unique fold for its acyltransferase-3 (AT3) domain, which contains 10 transmembrane helices arranged to form a large cytoplasmic cavity. The researchers also discovered that OafB uses a specific loop to allow the acyl-CoA donor to pass through the membrane and present the acetyl group to the catalytic residues on the extracytoplasmic surface. Additionally, they found that OafB interacts with a fused SGNH domain, which may help the protein to reach out and modify other molecules beyond the membrane. Overall, this study provides a new general model of AT3 function that could be useful for developing inhibitors to target critical functions of bacterial pathogens.</s>\n"

These proteins are important for many different processes in bacteria, such as forming relationships with other organisms, protecting against viruses and drugs, and making antibiotics. However, scientists do not know much about how these proteins work or what they look like. To learn more about them, scientists used a computer program to create a model of the structure of one of these proteins, called OafB. They found that this protein has a unique shape and that it works by taking an acyl group from inside the cell and putting it outside the cell near the place where it might be used. Scientists also found that another part of the protein, called the SGNH domain, helps the acyl group get put outside the cell. By understanding how these proteins work, scientists may be able to find ways to stop them from working, which could help fight against harmful bacteria.']\n",

This study employed evolutionary co-variance analysis to construct a computational model of the structure of OafB, which exhibits a novel fold for the AT3 domain. Molecular dynamics simulations were utilized to demonstrate the stability of the AT3 domain within the membrane. The AT3 domain features ten transmembrane helices, forming a large cytoplasmic cavity, and is proposed to present the acetyl group close to the likely catalytic residues on the extracytoplasmic surface via a pore created by the movement of an important loop capping the inner cavity. Additionally, limited but significant interactions with the fused SGNH domain are identified, and modelling suggests this domain may be mobile and capable of accepting acyl-groups from the AT3 and subsequently reaching acceptor substrates.
