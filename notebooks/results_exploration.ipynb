       "      <td>In our bodies, different genes have different amounts of expression, or the amount of protein they make. The reason for this variation is not well understood, and a lot of work has been done to understand how genetic changes affect the amount of protein produced. This work has mostly focused on the regions of DNA that are upstream of the protein-making part of the gene, which are called regulatory regions. These regions are important for controlling the amount of protein that is made from the gene. However, not much is known about how another type of genetic variation, called RNA 3′-end variation, affects gene expression. RNA 3′-end variation refers to changes in the length of the tail-like structure at the end of the RNA molecule that is produced from a gene. The aim of this work was to study how RNA 3′-end variation affects gene expression. The authors used samples of blood cells from different people and compared the length of the tails of RNA molecules that were produced from different genes. They found that the length of the tails varied between people, and that some of these differences were due to changes in the DNA sequence that affect how long the tail is. The authors then studied how the variation in the length of the tails affected gene expression. They found that the length of the tails of RNA molecules can change the amount of protein that is made from the gene, and that some of these differences were due to changes in the DNA sequence. The authors then focused on a specific gene that plays an important role in the immune system, and found that natural variation in the length of the tails of RNA molecules affects how the gene responds to antigen stimulation. This variation is due to differences in the DNA sequence of the gene. The authors conclude that the strategy of comparing the lengths of RNA molecules from different people with the amounts of protein they produce can help us understand how genetic variation affects gene expression.</td>\n",

In this study, the authors use deep sequencing technology and CD8 T cell epitope mapping to analyze the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals. They found that, in the acute phase of infection, the CD8 T cell response is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes. However, as the infection progresses, widespread sequence evolution and viral escape occur. Despite this escape, the authors show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes, a phenomenon called anentropic specificity. This expansion of anentropic specificity and increased response depth correlate with protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. These findings render SIVΔnef as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design.</td>\n",

However, our understanding of how the immune system fights off these infections is incomplete. In this study , we used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) to investigate the role of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling in antifungal immunity. We found that IL-1R is critical for controlling fungal growth during the early stages of infection. IL-1R affects neutrophils, which are important cells of the immune system, in two ways. First, it helps recruit neutrophils to the site of infection. Second, it mobilizes newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. Without IL-1R, mice had defects in chemokine production at the site of infection and in secretion of a factor that helps generate new neutrophils in the bloodstream. We discovered that endothelial cells, which line blood vessels, are the primary source of this factor and that they are influenced by IL-1R. Our findings suggest a new link between IL-1 and the production of new neutrophils during fungal infections, and they highlight two complementary mechanisms that coordinate the neutrophil response to protect the host from disease.</td>\n",

Calculating the resulting economic benefits of this achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to understand the Programme's impact on the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits, the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with disease prevention were then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were used, including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization, International Monetary Fund, and International Labour Organization. An estimated $21.8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF. Of this total, over $2.3 billion is realized by protecting nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of being born into areas freed of LF transmission. Similarly, more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease, resulting in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately $19.5 billion. In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity save the health systems of endemic countries approximately $2.2 billion. MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits, and with favorable program implementation costs, it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high, making it an excellent investment in global health.</td>\n",

To understand how GBA mutations cause Parkinson's disease, scientists created a new fish model of Gaucher disease. This model, called GBA-/-, has no activity of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase. Humans and mice with no glucocerebrosidase activity die at birth, but the GBA-/- fish lived for months. This allowed scientists to study the progression of the disease. The fish had symptoms that resembled Gaucher disease in humans, including infiltration of Gaucher cells into the brain, neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation. Unexpectedly, disrupting a protein called alpha-synuclein did not improve the disease symptoms. This study shows that the GBA-/- fish can be used as a new model of Gaucher disease, and that alpha-synuclein may not play a major role in the development of the disease.</td>\n",

There are different types of glaucoma, but the most common one is called primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). POAG has a complex genetic basis, meaning that it is caused by a combination of different genes. Previous research has identified a gene called SIX6 that may be involved in POAG. Now, researchers have sequenced the SIX6 gene in people with POAG and those without the disease, and they have found six variants, or changes, in the gene that may be linked to POAG. To test whether these variants are harmful or not, the researchers used zebrafish to look at how the variants affected the size of the eye and the structure of the optic nerve. They also found a clinical feature in people with POAG that seems to be linked to the SIX6 gene. This feature is a thinner layer of nerve cells in the back of the eye. Altogether, these findings suggest that the SIX6 gene may be involved in the development of POAG, and that changes to this gene may lead to problems with the optic nerve and vision loss.</td>\n",

It produces flagella, which help it to stick to intestinal cells, and glucosylating toxins, which are harmful to people. Flagellar gene expression also affects the production of these toxins. A \"flagellar switch\" has been identified in C . difficile that determines whether the bacteria produce flagellar genes and toxins. This switch is a region of DNA that can flip back and forth, changing the expression of flagellar genes and toxins. Bacteria that have the switch in one orientation produce flagellar genes, toxins, and flagella, while bacteria with the switch in the opposite orientation do not. The orientation of the switch can be changed during growth in the lab. Gene regulation via the switch happens after the switch has turned on the production of flagellar genes. A specific protein is responsible for turning off gene expression when the switch is in the opposite orientation. The tyrosine recombinase RecV, which is responsible for inverting the switch at another location in the genome, also inverts the switch. The phase variable expression of flagellar genes and toxins suggests that they have both beneficial and harmful effects on the bacteria during infection.</td>\n",

During endosporulation, gene expression is controlled by sigma subunits of RNA polymerase. In the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, sigma subunits such as σF and σE control early stages of development and are replaced later by σG and σK. The activity of these sigma factors is sequential and depends on the previous factor, and involves cell-cell signaling at key stages. In this study, researchers looked at the function and regulation of these sigma subunits in Clostridium difficile, an intestinal pathogen that produces hardy endospores. They found that the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved, but that σE is partially independent of σF, σG activity is not dependent on σE, and σK activity does not require σG. The researchers also found that σK is not strictly required for heat resistant spore formation. Taken together, these results show that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution, but that there are some deviations from the B. subtilis paradigm.</td>\n",

The best way for these proteins to work is if their individual sites become active together and help each other. This makes the model useful for analyzing systems with several multisite proteins that might interact at the same time. For an example, the study looked at a checkpoint signaling pathway in yeast that measures how fast the cells are growing. The pathway includes a signal that is proportional to the size of the bud (a new part of the cell that grows out from the mother cell), a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response that is triggered only when the signal reaches a certain threshold.</td>\n",

QS systems are controlled by molecules called autoinducers , which accumulate as bacteria grow and communicate with one another to initiate group behaviors . However, it has been difficult to understand how QS works at a molecular level . To investigate this, we used mathematical models to analyze the quorum sensing system of Escherichia coli ( E . coli ), which uses a molecule called AI-2 to communicate . We found that this system is controlled by a combination of negative and positive feedback loops, which are a type of regulatory mechanism that allow for communication within a network. These feedback loops help to balance the system by controlling the levels of AI-2 and the activity of other proteins involved in QS. We also found that a previously unknown negative feedback loop plays a key role in the functioning of the E . coli QS system. Finally, we developed a simple mathematical model that helped us to understand how these feedback loops interact and control the overall behavior of the QS system. By studying QS in this way, we can better understand how bacterial groups behave and develop strategies to control or disrupt these behaviors if necessary.</td>\n",

We used thick blood smear light microscopy, urine filtration, and Kato-Katz technique to diagnose malaria and worm infections in school-age children. We found that the overall prevalence of malaria, S. haematobium, and co-infection with both parasites was 30%, 23%, and 9% on enrollment, respectively. Our results showed that schistosomiasis increased the risk of malaria infection, but when combined with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection, the risk was even higher. We also found that the incidence of malaria was higher in children infected with S. haematobium compared to children not infected.

IRF-5 is involved in the production of important inflammatory proteins, such as IL-6 and TNF . We found that the inflammatory response regulated by IRF-5 limits the growth of immune cells called CD8+ T cells and encourages the production of a molecule called HIF-1α in immune cells called dendritic cells (DCs) . When we removed the ability of DCs to produce HIF-1α, we observed that CD8+ T cells grew faster and that IL-12 was produced more by DCs. Furthermore, when we removed the ability of DCs to produce HIF-1α, the parasite burden in the spleen of infected mice was reduced .

However, high levels of drug use may lead to the emergence of chemoresistant parasites. The level of susceptibility to antimony of Leishmania parasites transmitted in Algeria is not well understood. This study aimed to determine the susceptibility of Leishmania parasites in Algeria to antimony, which is critical for the development of effective public health policies. The study analyzed a total of 106 Leishmania isolates, including 88 isolates from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines collected between 1976 and 2013 in 14 endemic localities in Algeria and 18 isolates from dogs in France. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of potassium antimony tartrate (Sb (III)) and sodium stibogluconate (Sb (V)) were determined in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively. The epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) that allowed differentiation between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis that were susceptible (S+) or insusceptible (S-) to the trivalent form of antimony was determined. The computed IC50 cutoff values were 23.83 μg/mL and 15.91 μg/mL for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. The study reports a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis isolates during the 30-year period. In contrast, an increase in the frequency of insusceptible phenotypes in isolates causing cutaneous leishmaniasis was observed during the same period. The emergence of insusceptible phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of L. killicki (syn: L. tropica) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and have emerged in Algeria during the last decade. The study provides insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria. The authors highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Scientists have found that genetically identical cells can exhibit different behaviors even under the same conditions. This \"nongenetic heterogeneity\" has important implications for medicine because it can lead to different growth rates or responses to drugs or stresses in cells such as tumors and bacteria. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, scientists have found that growth rate correlates with susceptibility to heat stress in individual cells. By using genetic and chemical manipulations, combined with high-throughput single-cell assays, they found that heterogeneity in the levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its effects on the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway are the underlying cause of this nongenetic heterogeneity. Lower levels of cAMP in cells correspond to slower growth rates, and a reporter of PKA pathway activity also correlates with growth rates in individual cells. The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 have different roles in nongenetic heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in growth rate requires both paralogs, but only Msn2 is required for heterogeneity in stress tolerance. Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in the cAMP-PKA pathway or by culturing wild-type cells with cAMP analogs or PKA inhibitors affects the survival of acute heat stress. Perturbations that increase cAMP levels reduce the slower-growing subpopulation and increase susceptibility to acute heat stress, whereas PKA inhibition slows growth and increases susceptibility to acute heat stress. Loss of Msn2 reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the correlation in individual cells between growth rate and acute-stress survival, suggesting a major role for the Msn2 pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity but also a residual benefit of slow growth. These results provide insight into the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment.</td>\n",

In the past, CHIKV has only affected tropical and subtropical areas around the world. But now it is spreading quickly in North and South America. To understand how this virus is evolving in this new region, researchers have used advanced technology called deep-sequencing to look at the genetic makeup of CHIKV in people who are infected with the virus. They found that there are many different versions of the virus circulating in people's bodies, each with slight differences in their genetic code. These genetic differences are known as minor variants. The researchers also found that the overall genetic diversity of the virus decreased after it was passed through cells in the lab. This suggests that the virus is adapting to its new environment. Additionally, the researchers discovered a new genetic structure, or UTR ( untranslated region ) in the virus's genome. This new UTR may help the virus to replicate better in cells in the lab. Overall, this study provides important information about how the virus is changing in this new environment. It also highlights the need to continue tracking the evolution of the virus over time to see how it continues to change.</td>\n",

In this study, we found a new gene called UBTOR that regulates cell growth and mTOR signaling. When we reduced UBTOR function in neurons and a type of cancer cell line, cells grew longer neurites and had more cell colonies, respectively. On the other hand, overexpression of UBTOR in cancer cells inhibited colony formation. UBTOR stabilizes a key component of the mTOR complex called DEPTOR, and when UBTOR function is reduced, DEPTOR is lost, leading to increased mTOR signaling. We also found that when the ubtor gene was disrupted, the zebrafish developed faster tumors when a cancer-causing gene (HRAS) was introduced, and this was associated with increased mTOR signaling. Finally, we found that reducing UBTOR function in a mouse model of cancer also promoted tumor growth and increased mTOR signaling. These results show that UBTOR plays a critical role in controlling cell growth and cancer development via the mTOR signaling pathway.</td>\n",

In this report, the authors describe a third form of systemic leishmaniasis that is characterized by atypical symptoms, such as lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) and anemia (low red blood cell count). To identify this new form of leishmaniasis, the authors performed specialized tests on blood and biopsy samples from patients suspected to have a weakened immune system. They found that 19.4% of these patients had normal laboratory test results but were found to have macrophages (a type of immune cell) that were loaded with parasites and were not functioning properly. These findings suggest that systemic leishmaniasis may present with a wider variety of symptoms than previously thought, and it may be more common than currently diagnosed. The authors recommend considering the diagnosis of atypical systemic leishmaniasis in any patient who has a weakened immune system and no clear immunologic defect.</td>\n",

In this study, researchers injected a specific type of antibody (IgG1 form) into rhesus monkeys via a virus-like particle (AAV) . The antibody was able to persist in the monkeys' bloodstream at high concentrations. However, the monkeys' bodies responded to the antibody and produced their own antibodies against the delivered antibody. This response limited how much antibody could be delivered and achieved. Despite the lower levels of delivered antibody, the monkeys showed significant protection against a difficult-to-neutralize virus, including lower levels of viral load at peak height and set point, and a delay in the time to peak viral load. The monkey with the highest level of delivered antibody completely resisted multiple virus challenges.

In this study, researchers set out to investigate the relationship between CIE and caveolins and cavins.

Most oHSVs gain cancer-specificity from deletions or mutations in genes that prevent the virus from being recognized by the immune system, but this also makes them weaker or less active. We developed a new type of oHSV called R-LM113 and R-115, which have no deletions or mutations, gain specificity by binding to tumor cells through a protein called HER2, and are fully-active. In this study, we tested R-LM113 and R-115 in immunocompetent mice with lung cancer. We found that both viruses were safe and effective at shrinking the primary tumor, and R-115 was even more effective. Furthermore, we found that R-115 caused the immune system to be more active against the cancer cells, and this lasted even after the primary tumor was gone. This is known as an \"abscopal\" effect, which means that the immune system is activated not only in the tumor where the virus was injected, but also in a second, untreated tumor. We also found that R-115 caused the immune system to break its \"tolerance\" of the cancer cells, which means that the immune system started to attack the cancer cells even in the absence of the virus. This is a sign that the virus is working as a vaccine to protect against future tumors. In summary, R-LM113 and R-115 are safe and effective at treating cancer, and cause the immune system to be more active against cancer cells even after the primary tumor is gone. This makes them promising candidates for future cancer treatments.</td>\n",

There is concern that the HIV infections in the Ad5 trial were caused by the vaccine vector itself rather than the HIV virus itself. In this study, we examined the HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by a different vaccine vector, ALVAC ( canarypox virus ), which was used in a vaccine trial in Thailand ( RV144 ). We found that CD4 T cells induced by ALVAC were much less susceptible to HIV infection than CD4 T cells induced by Ad5. This lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells was associated with a lack of surface expression of key HIV entry co-receptors, which are important for HIV infection. Interestingly, ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells also had a strong Th1 phenotype, which is associated with protection against HIV infection. On the other hand, Ad5-induced CD4 T cells had a strong Th2 phenotype, which is associated with poor protection against HIV infection. In addition, ALVAC and Ad5 induced distinct profiles of CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses, with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation while Ad5 induced CD4 T-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.</td>\n",

To better understand RVFV pathogenesis and immune response, researchers infected C57BL/6 mice with either a wild-type strain or a vaccine strain. The animals infected with the vaccine strain had little to no evidence of clinical disease or cytokine response. On the other hand, animals infected with the wild-type strain had severe disease characterized by lymphocyte and platelet depletion, a strong cytokine response, high virus titers, and tissue pathology. Lymphocyte and platelet depletion were indicative of disease onset and were correlated with increases in G-CSF production, suggesting that G-CSF may be a potential treatment. RVFV is known to be hepatotropic, and the virus resulted in significant clinical and histological data indicating hepatitis. However, the pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent, and instead, a chemokine response was evident, suggesting infiltration of immunoreactive cells such as neutrophils. In the brains of infected mice, a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, but with little pathology, indicating meningoencephalitis.

Toxoplasma's ability to infect and manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport \"GRA\" proteins, which originate in unique secretory organelles called dense granules into the host cell. These GRA proteins have diverse roles in Toxoplasma's intracellular lifecycle, including co-opting crucial host cell functions and proteins, such as the cell cycle, c-Myc and p38 MAP kinase. Some of these GRA proteins, such as GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within which Toxoplasma replicates and are transported across the PV membrane (PVM) into the host cell. In this study, the authors identified additional proteins necessary for the transport of these GRAs into the host cell by screening Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus. They found that novel proteins MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell. These proteins are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1, which is cleaved by TgASP5 into two fragments. These three proteins are membrane-associated, and MYR3, but not MYR2, stably associates with MYR1. The authors also showed that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. Overall, these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell.</td>\n",

In this study, the authors found that HPV E2 binds to a protein called ORC2, which is a key player in starting the process of DNA replication. However, the authors did not find that ORC2 is important for the process of copying HPV DNA. In fact, the authors found that ORC2 actually suppresses the ability of E2 to start copying the DNA. This result is surprising because ORC2 is usually needed to start the process of copying DNA in cells. The authors also found that when the HPV E2 protein is overexpressed, it restricts the ability of ORC2 to start the process of copying DNA at known locations in the human genome. This result suggests that HPV E2 may be interfering with the process of copying DNA at these locations.

In low-income countries, many people live in urban areas and keep livestock in close proximity to their homes, increasing the risk of zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis spreading to humans. To investigate the prevalence of brucellosis in urban and peri-urban areas of Dushanbe, Tajikistan, researchers collected samples of cow milk from 564 cows and used a real-time PCR test to detect the presence of Brucella DNA. They found that 5.3% of the cows were infected with Brucella, and that the disease was present in both seropositive and seronegative cows. The researchers used DNA sequencing to determine that the two seronegative cows were likely infected with different species of Brucella. These findings highlight the need for developing new diagnostic strategies to identify false seronegative individuals and for further research to understand the spread of brucellosis in this region. The study also suggests that vaccination of cows with S19 and small ruminants with Rev 1 may be necessary to control the disease.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Scientists have known for a long time that many organisms have extra or \"accessory\" chromosomes that differ from the usual set of chromosomes in various ways. These accessory chromosomes can have repetitive elements, be transcriptionally repressed, and have many histone methylation marks, such as methylation of lysine 9 or 27 on histone 3 (H3K9me3 or H3K27me3). To better understand how these marks affect chromosome and genome stability in fungi, scientists deleted the genes responsible for producing these marks in the pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, which has up to eight accessory chromosomes. To investigate this, they used whole genome sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and RNA sequencing to compare the changes in genome and chromatin structure, as well as differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains. They found that the loss of H3K9me3 led to the relocalization of H3K27me3, formation of new chromosomes, and the activation of transposable elements. On the other hand, the loss of H3K27me3 actually increased the stability of accessory chromosomes, but this was not accompanied by large-scale changes in gene activity. The scientists concluded that H3K9me3 helps to maintain genome stability by preventing H3K27me3 from forming in certain regions of the genome. In other words, H3K27me3 helps to create a \"metastable\" state for certain regions of the genome, which are important but not essential for the fungus's survival.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Rabies is a dangerous and often fatal disease . To prevent the onset of rabies in people who have been exposed to it, they need to receive a special kind of vaccination called post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) as soon as possible. Unfortunately , life-saving vaccines and biologicals for rabies are hard to get and expensive, especially for the poorest people who are at the greatest risk of getting rabies . It is important to find ways to make it easier for people who have been exposed to rabies to get the vaccination they need, and to do it at a lower cost. In this study , researchers found that giving people the rabies vaccine through their skin ( intradermal delivery ) instead of through a muscle ( intramuscular delivery ) is just as effective but uses a lot less vaccine. This means that it is possible to treat more people with the same amount of vaccine, which could help solve problems with vaccine shortages. In addition , this study shows that using intradermal delivery is much cheaper than intramuscular delivery. The researchers suggest ways that governments and other organizations can pay for the vaccines so that more people can get them. This would make it easier for people to get the treatment they need to prevent rabies, and it would also be cheaper for organizations to provide this treatment. Overall, this study shows that it is important to use intradermal delivery of PEP to make it more accessible and affordable for people who have been exposed to rabies, and that this could lead to a reduction in human deaths from rabies.</td>\n",

In the current study, the authors looked at how Toxoplasma acquires nutrients from host cells. They found that lipid droplets (LDs) in the host cells are a source of lipids for the parasite, and that parasites are able to access and utilize lipids from LDs to build their own membranes and organelles. The authors also found that Toxoplasma uses an intravacuolar network of membranes to scavenge lipids from host LDs inside the PV. In addition, the authors discovered that when parasites are fed lipids, they create endocytic-like structures to absorb the excess lipids from the PV. The study highlights the importance of host LDs in supporting the growth of Toxoplasma, and the parasite's ability to acquire lipids from these organelles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fasciolosis is a disease of cattle and sheep caused by liver flukes called Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica . There is concern that fasciolosis is becoming more common among humans, making it an emerging zoonotic disease. Currently, chemotherapy is the primary way to control fasciolosis, but it is not always effective due to the presence of resistant parasites. To find new ways to control this disease, scientists have searched for drugs that can kill the juvenile and mature stages of the parasites. In this study, the researchers found chalcones, which are a type of flavonoid, could kill juvenile liver flukes by interacting with key parts of the enzymes that digest proteins. One chalcone, C34, was particularly effective and reduced the ability of the young larvae to penetrate the gut wall and decreased their viability in the laboratory. This is an exciting discovery, as it provides a new potential treatment for fasciolosis. The researchers hope that this finding can lead to the development of new drugs to control fasciolosis and potentially other helminthic diseases.</td>\n",

These cells send the information to the inner retina. Using imaging techniques, we studied how these cells transmit information about fast and slow changes in light intensity. We found that the size of the synaptic terminal is an important property that affects how fast and slow changes in light intensity are transmitted. Each bipolar cell has multiple terminals of different sizes, and smaller terminals transmit faster and more effectively. Modeling the global calcium dynamics shows that the size of the presynaptic compartment is directly linked to the adaptability of these neurons. This suggests that bipolar cells can transmit different components of the visual signal through synaptic terminals with different adaptational properties.</td>\n",

Fluorescence microscopy ( FM ) can detect many different molecules in synapses quickly and cheaply, but it is difficult to distinguish between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals. Electron microscopy ( EM ) is the best tool for seeing individual synapses clearly, but it is slow, expensive, and cannot tell which molecules are in the synapse. To address this issue, researchers have developed a new method for detecting synapses using fluorescence microscopy images and comparing them to electron microscopy images. They found that their new method was just as good as human annotators at detecting synapses and reproducing important features of synapse distributions, such as the types of molecules in the synapse and the number of synapses in a certain region of the brain. This new tool is likely to be useful for analyzing standard fluorescence microscopy images and could help scientists discover new types of synapses.</td>\n",

Zinc moves in and out of cells through two families of transporters, called ZnT and ZIP . One of these transporters, called ZnT2, is responsible for zinc transport during breastfeeding . However, we do not know exactly how ZnT2 works. In this study, we have created a model of how ZnT2 works and have shown that it transports zinc using the proton gradient in acidic vesicles. Using special inhibitors and markers to track the pH inside vesicles, we have shown that when we add zinc to acidic vesicles, the vesicles get less acidic. This happens because ZnT2 takes in protons and gives away zinc. We have also calculated the math behind this process and found that ZnT2 exchanges two protons for every zinc ion. Overall, ZnT2 is an important transporter that helps us maintain our zinc levels and overall health.</td>\n",

During this process, cells use a machinery called the replication fork to move down the DNA strand and make a copy of it . 14-3-3 proteins are able to sense when the replication fork is not working properly and respond by activating special proteins called checkpoints . Exonuclease 1 ( Exo1 ) is a protein that processes stalled replication forks when the checkpoints are not working . We now know that 14-3-3 proteins bind to Exo1 in both yeast and human cells . When 14-3-3 proteins are missing in yeast, the checkpoint does not properly activate Exo1 and more DNA damage occurs at the stalled forks. We have also found that 14-3-3 proteins help to promote the movement of the replication fork under stressful conditions such as low levels of nutrients in the cell. This suggests that 14-3-3 proteins play an important role in making sure that DNA is copied accurately during cell division.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Scientists have been trying to understand the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and the resulting immune response. To help them study this, they developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC from all lymphoid organs. They used this antibody to deplete pDC before HIV-1 infection in a humanized mouse model. During acute HIV-1 infection, they found that the induction of type I interferons (IFN-I) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished in pDC-depleted mice. This was consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, as HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1-induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs, but not the blood, was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication. This was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells. The scientists conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis. These findings suggest that pDC depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retroviral treatment.</td>\n",

However, whether Nrf2 activation affects human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection is unknown. A substance called sulforaphane ( SFN ), found in cruciferous vegetables after injury, activates Nrf2 to reprogram gene expression. We have found that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. This blockade of infection is due to Nrf2 activation, which is mobilized by SFN. We also found that SFN treatment blocks HIV infection after entry but before 2-LTR circles are formed, and that neither SAMHD1 nor MX2 are upregulated. This suggests that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection and highlights a novel way to trigger this inhibition.</td>\n",

During a study in Kenya , researchers found that about 76% of pregnant women had at least one geohelminth infection . Many of these women lived in areas with poor water supply and sanitation . The most common geohelminths found in the study were Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura. Although these infections were common, the researchers did not find any major negative effects on the pregnant women, such as clinical symptoms or weight loss. However, hookworm infections were associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference and lower hemoglobin levels in women with high egg counts. This suggests that hookworm infections may have some negative effects on the health of pregnant women, especially when the infection is severe. The researchers also found that women with Ascaris lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasites in their blood than women without Ascaris lumbricoides. This suggests that geohelminth infections may have some protective effects against malaria parasites. Overall, the study highlights the importance of addressing geohelminth infections in pregnant women in areas with poor water supply and sanitation.</td>\n",

We found that mycolactone inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by these cells within the first 24 hours of exposure, without affecting their viability. Additionally, mycolactone prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia. To investigate whether mycolactone affects neuroinflammation in vivo, we used a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve. Mycolactone was injected daily for three days into the spinal canal, and we found that it decreased the local production of inflammatory cytokines without causing detectable cytotoxicity. In summary, mycolactone suppressed the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia without affecting their viability, which may partially explain the analgesic properties of mycolactone.</td>\n",

In Guinea, researchers collected samples from 425 individuals, including 232 HAT cases, 79 subjects with a long-lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls. They then analyzed the association of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes with HAT outcome. The IL6 gene was found to be associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease (p = 0.0001, OR = 0.39, CI95 = [0.24–0.63], BONF = 0.0034). Similarly, the MIF gene was found to be associated with an increased risk of developing HAT (p = 0.0239, OR = 1.65, CI95 = [1.07–2.53], BONF = 0.6697), although this association did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. The MIF gene was also found to be associated with latent infections (p = 0.0077, OR = 1.86, CI95 = [1.18–2.95], BONF = 0.2157). The APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) was found to be associated with a higher risk of developing HAT (p = 0.0011, OR = 2.70, CI95 = [1.49–4.91], BONF = 0.0301), while the APOL1 G1 polymorphism was found to be associated with a lower risk of developing HAT (p = 0.0005, OR = 0.45, CI95 = [0.29–0.70], BONF = 0.0129). No other associations were found with other candidate genes. Overall, these results suggest that host genetic factors are involved in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea, and may lead to the development of new control tools.</td>\n",

The reason for this variation is not well understood, and a lot of work has been done to understand how genetic changes affect the amount of protein produced. This work has mostly focused on the regions of DNA that are upstream of the protein-making part of the gene, which are called regulatory regions. These regions are important for controlling the amount of protein that is made from the gene. However, not much is known about how another type of genetic variation, called RNA 3′-end variation, affects gene expression. RNA 3′-end variation refers to changes in the length of the tail-like structure at the end of the RNA molecule that is produced from a gene. The aim of this work was to study how RNA 3′-end variation affects gene expression. The authors used samples of blood cells from different people and compared the length of the tails of RNA molecules that were produced from different genes. They found that the length of the tails varied between people, and that some of these differences were due to changes in the DNA sequence that affect how long the tail is. The authors then studied how the variation in the length of the tails affected gene expression. They found that the length of the tails of RNA molecules can change the amount of protein that is made from the gene, and that some of these differences were due to changes in the DNA sequence. The authors then focused on a specific gene that plays an important role in the immune system, and found that natural variation in the length of the tails of RNA molecules affects how the gene responds to antigen stimulation. This variation is due to differences in the DNA sequence of the gene. The authors conclude that the strategy of comparing the lengths of RNA molecules from different people with the amounts of protein they produce can help us understand how genetic variation affects gene expression.  \n",

In this study, the authors use deep sequencing technology and CD8 T cell epitope mapping to analyze the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals. They found that, in the acute phase of infection, the CD8 T cell response is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes. However, as the infection progresses, widespread sequence evolution and viral escape occur. Despite this escape, the authors show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes, a phenomenon called anentropic specificity. This expansion of anentropic specificity and increased response depth correlate with protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. These findings render SIVΔnef as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design.  \n",

However, our understanding of how the immune system fights off these infections is incomplete. In this study , we used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) to investigate the role of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling in antifungal immunity. We found that IL-1R is critical for controlling fungal growth during the early stages of infection. IL-1R affects neutrophils, which are important cells of the immune system, in two ways. First, it helps recruit neutrophils to the site of infection. Second, it mobilizes newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. Without IL-1R, mice had defects in chemokine production at the site of infection and in secretion of a factor that helps generate new neutrophils in the bloodstream. We discovered that endothelial cells, which line blood vessels, are the primary source of this factor and that they are influenced by IL-1R. Our findings suggest a new link between IL-1 and the production of new neutrophils during fungal infections, and they highlight two complementary mechanisms that coordinate the neutrophil response to protect the host from disease.  \n",

Calculating the resulting economic benefits of this achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to understand the Programme's impact on the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits, the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with disease prevention were then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were used, including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization, International Monetary Fund, and International Labour Organization. An estimated $21.8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF. Of this total, over $2.3 billion is realized by protecting nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of being born into areas freed of LF transmission. Similarly, more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease, resulting in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately $19.5 billion. In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity save the health systems of endemic countries approximately $2.2 billion. MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits, and with favorable program implementation costs, it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high, making it an excellent investment in global health.  \n",

These mutations can cause Parkinson's disease too. To understand how GBA mutations cause Parkinson's disease, scientists created a new fish model of Gaucher disease. This model, called GBA-/-, has no activity of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase. Humans and mice with no glucocerebrosidase activity die at birth, but the GBA-/- fish lived for months. This allowed scientists to study the progression of the disease. The fish had symptoms that resembled Gaucher disease in humans, including infiltration of Gaucher cells into the brain, neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation. Unexpectedly, disrupting a protein called alpha-synuclein did not improve the disease symptoms. This study shows that the GBA-/- fish can be used as a new model of Gaucher disease, and that alpha-synuclein may not play a major role in the development of the disease.  \n",

It has a special ability to infect human immune cells and cause an immune response that can protect against future infections. In this study, we found that bacteria that are contained in a special compartment within immune cells ( called phagosomes ) can suppress the immune response to the bacteria in the same compartment as well as the bacteria in the rest of the cell . We also found that the bacteria in the phagosome make a protein that blocks the immune response by interfering with the way that the immune system produces a protein called interleukin-10 . When we blocked the interleukin-10 or used mice that don't have the interleukin-10 protein , the immune response was restored. These results show that the way that bacteria can interfere with the immune system can have important implications for human health.  \n",

It is caused by problems with the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eye to the brain. There are different types of glaucoma, but the most common one is called primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). POAG has a complex genetic basis, meaning that it is caused by a combination of different genes. Previous research has identified a gene called SIX6 that may be involved in POAG. Now, researchers have sequenced the SIX6 gene in people with POAG and those without the disease, and they have found six variants, or changes, in the gene that may be linked to POAG. To test whether these variants are harmful or not, the researchers used zebrafish to look at how the variants affected the size of the eye and the structure of the optic nerve. They also found a clinical feature in people with POAG that seems to be linked to the SIX6 gene. This feature is a thinner layer of nerve cells in the back of the eye. Altogether, these findings suggest that the SIX6 gene may be involved in the development of POAG, and that changes to this gene may lead to problems with the optic nerve and vision loss.  \n",

It produces flagella, which help it to stick to intestinal cells, and glucosylating toxins, which are harmful to people. Flagellar gene expression also affects the production of these toxins. A \"flagellar switch\" has been identified in C . difficile that determines whether the bacteria produce flagellar genes and toxins. This switch is a region of DNA that can flip back and forth, changing the expression of flagellar genes and toxins. Bacteria that have the switch in one orientation produce flagellar genes, toxins, and flagella, while bacteria with the switch in the opposite orientation do not. The orientation of the switch can be changed during growth in the lab. Gene regulation via the switch happens after the switch has turned on the production of flagellar genes. A specific protein is responsible for turning off gene expression when the switch is in the opposite orientation. The tyrosine recombinase RecV, which is responsible for inverting the switch at another location in the genome, also inverts the switch. The phase variable expression of flagellar genes and toxins suggests that they have both beneficial and harmful effects on the bacteria during infection.  \n",

During endosporulation, gene expression is controlled by sigma subunits of RNA polymerase. In the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, sigma subunits such as σF and σE control early stages of development and are replaced later by σG and σK. The activity of these sigma factors is sequential and depends on the previous factor, and involves cell-cell signaling at key stages. In this study, researchers looked at the function and regulation of these sigma subunits in Clostridium difficile, an intestinal pathogen that produces hardy endospores. They found that the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved, but that σE is partially independent of σF, σG activity is not dependent on σE, and σK activity does not require σG. The researchers also found that σK is not strictly required for heat resistant spore formation. Taken together, these results show that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution, but that there are some deviations from the B. subtilis paradigm.  \n",

This reduction can accurately mimic the behavior of more complicated multisite systems, such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model. The best way for these proteins to work is if their individual sites become active together and help each other. This makes the model useful for analyzing systems with several multisite proteins that might interact at the same time. For an example, the study looked at a checkpoint signaling pathway in yeast that measures how fast the cells are growing. The pathway includes a signal that is proportional to the size of the bud (a new part of the cell that grows out from the mother cell), a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response that is triggered only when the signal reaches a certain threshold.  \n",

QS systems are controlled by molecules called autoinducers , which accumulate as bacteria grow and communicate with one another to initiate group behaviors . However, it has been difficult to understand how QS works at a molecular level . To investigate this, we used mathematical models to analyze the quorum sensing system of Escherichia coli ( E . coli ), which uses a molecule called AI-2 to communicate . We found that this system is controlled by a combination of negative and positive feedback loops, which are a type of regulatory mechanism that allow for communication within a network. These feedback loops help to balance the system by controlling the levels of AI-2 and the activity of other proteins involved in QS. We also found that a previously unknown negative feedback loop plays a key role in the functioning of the E . coli QS system. Finally, we developed a simple mathematical model that helped us to understand how these feedback loops interact and control the overall behavior of the QS system. By studying QS in this way, we can better understand how bacterial groups behave and develop strategies to control or disrupt these behaviors if necessary.  \n",

In this study, we looked at how the presence of two parasites, the worm Schistosoma haematobium and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, affect each other in children in Gabon. We used thick blood smear light microscopy, urine filtration, and Kato-Katz technique to diagnose malaria and worm infections in school-age children. We found that the overall prevalence of malaria, S. haematobium, and co-infection with both parasites was 30%, 23%, and 9% on enrollment, respectively. Our results showed that schistosomiasis increased the risk of malaria infection, but when combined with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection, the risk was even higher. We also found that the incidence of malaria was higher in children infected with S. haematobium compared to children not infected. Overall, our findings suggest that worm infections can enhance the risk of malaria infection and that schistosomiasis may increase susceptibility to malaria in young children but not in older children.  \n",

The immune system's response to this infection is essential for fighting off the parasite . In this study, we investigated the role of a transcription factor called IRF-5 in the immune response to Leishmania . IRF-5 is involved in the production of important inflammatory proteins, such as IL-6 and TNF . We found that the inflammatory response regulated by IRF-5 limits the growth of immune cells called CD8+ T cells and encourages the production of a molecule called HIF-1α in immune cells called dendritic cells (DCs) . When we removed the ability of DCs to produce HIF-1α, we observed that CD8+ T cells grew faster and that IL-12 was produced more by DCs. Furthermore, when we removed the ability of DCs to produce HIF-1α, the parasite burden in the spleen of infected mice was reduced . These results suggest that inducing HIF-1α in DCs may be a way for Leishmania parasites to evade the immune system and cause persistent infections.  \n",

To help medical professionals make better clinical decisions, it would be useful to have a way to predict which patients are more likely to have a bad outcome. This study is a review of studies conducted in Latin America to identify which factors are associated with a bad outcome or death from VL. We found that the most important predictors of bad outcomes were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age less than 5 and older than 40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Other factors, such as edema and low hemoglobin concentration, were also associated with bad outcomes. The main limitation of this study was that many of the prognostic models were not validated, meaning that further research needs to be done to confirm the accuracy of these models. Overall, this study has helped identify important predictors of bad outcomes from VL, which may help medical professionals better care for their patients.  \n",
       "14  In Algeria, the treatment of leishmaniasis, a parasitic infection transmitted by sandflies, has mainly relied on antimony-based drugs. However, high levels of drug use may lead to the emergence of chemoresistant parasites. The level of susceptibility to antimony of Leishmania parasites transmitted in Algeria is not well understood. This study aimed to determine the susceptibility of Leishmania parasites in Algeria to antimony, which is critical for the development of effective public health policies. The study analyzed a total of 106 Leishmania isolates, including 88 isolates from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines collected between 1976 and 2013 in 14 endemic localities in Algeria and 18 isolates from dogs in France. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of potassium antimony tartrate (Sb (III)) and sodium stibogluconate (Sb (V)) were determined in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively. The epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) that allowed differentiation between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis that were susceptible (S+) or insusceptible (S-) to the trivalent form of antimony was determined. The computed IC50 cutoff values were 23.83 μg/mL and 15.91 μg/mL for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. The study reports a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis isolates during the 30-year period. In contrast, an increase in the frequency of insusceptible phenotypes in isolates causing cutaneous leishmaniasis was observed during the same period. The emergence of insusceptible phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of L. killicki (syn: L. tropica) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and have emerged in Algeria during the last decade. The study provides insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria. The authors highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains.  \n",

Recent studies have linked CD to foodborne pathogens that cause acute gastroenteritis, but the exact relationship is unknown. Therefore, researchers developed two new models to study the comorbidity of gastroenteritis with the bacterial pathobiont, AIEC (adherent-invasive E.coli), which is associated with CD. The results of this study indicate that the tissue-associated expansion of AIEC is responsible for the ongoing relationship between gastroenteritis and CD. Researchers also found that the immune system, intestinal barrier, and recovery after pathogen clearance are affected. This study suggests that individuals with AIEC at the time of acute gastroenteritis have a higher risk of developing CD. Researchers also found that AIEC can be targeted to develop therapeutic interventions for individuals at risk of developing CD after gastroenteritis.  \n",

The female gametophyte is made up of five specialized cells and one large egg cell . A smaller cell called the central cell is next to the egg cell and helps fertilization happen . It's not completely clear how these specialized cells are made during development. In this study , the authors looked for genes that help make the egg cell in the Arabidopsis plant . They found a mutant that made more egg cells than usual. In this mutant, some of the specialized cells made by the plant changed into egg cells instead of their normal job of supporting fertilization. The authors think that a protein called LIS makes a special cell fate happen in the egg cells.

In a rural highland Ethiopian community where podoconiosis is common, we used this tool to understand why and when children do not wear shoes. We talked to 242 people in the community through focus groups, interviews, and case studies. Many people saw going barefoot as “shameful” and thought that shoes were both protective and dignifying. However, many people could not afford to buy new shoes regularly because they were too expensive or not suitable for daily activities. Additionally, some people were worried that wearing certain types of shoes would label them. We think that by understanding these barriers, we can help people wear shoes more often, which can prevent podoconiosis and other diseases caused by walking barefoot.  \n",

PRV's Us9 protein is important for axonal sorting of viral capsids and glycoproteins in infected cells. However, it is unclear how Us9 directs so many viral proteins to axons. We found that Us9 is associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes. Moreover, we determined that the association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and, as a consequence, for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system. In other words, Us9 plays a crucial role in PRV's ability to target and infect specific cells in the body.  \n",
       "19                                                                                                                                                 Scientists have found that genetically identical cells can exhibit different behaviors even under the same conditions. This \"nongenetic heterogeneity\" has important implications for medicine because it can lead to different growth rates or responses to drugs or stresses in cells such as tumors and bacteria. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, scientists have found that growth rate correlates with susceptibility to heat stress in individual cells. By using genetic and chemical manipulations, combined with high-throughput single-cell assays, they found that heterogeneity in the levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its effects on the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway are the underlying cause of this nongenetic heterogeneity. Lower levels of cAMP in cells correspond to slower growth rates, and a reporter of PKA pathway activity also correlates with growth rates in individual cells. The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 have different roles in nongenetic heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in growth rate requires both paralogs, but only Msn2 is required for heterogeneity in stress tolerance. Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in the cAMP-PKA pathway or by culturing wild-type cells with cAMP analogs or PKA inhibitors affects the survival of acute heat stress. Perturbations that increase cAMP levels reduce the slower-growing subpopulation and increase susceptibility to acute heat stress, whereas PKA inhibition slows growth and increases susceptibility to acute heat stress. Loss of Msn2 reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the correlation in individual cells between growth rate and acute-stress survival, suggesting a major role for the Msn2 pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity but also a residual benefit of slow growth. These results provide insight into the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment.  \n",

This virus is known to cause fever, joint pain and rash in humans. In the past, CHIKV has only affected tropical and subtropical areas around the world. But now it is spreading quickly in North and South America. To understand how this virus is evolving in this new region, researchers have used advanced technology called deep-sequencing to look at the genetic makeup of CHIKV in people who are infected with the virus. They found that there are many different versions of the virus circulating in people's bodies, each with slight differences in their genetic code. These genetic differences are known as minor variants. The researchers also found that the overall genetic diversity of the virus decreased after it was passed through cells in the lab. This suggests that the virus is adapting to its new environment. Additionally, the researchers discovered a new genetic structure, or UTR ( untranslated region ) in the virus's genome. This new UTR may help the virus to replicate better in cells in the lab. Overall, this study provides important information about how the virus is changing in this new environment. It also highlights the need to continue tracking the evolution of the virus over time to see how it continues to change.  \n",

In this study, we found a new gene called UBTOR that regulates cell growth and mTOR signaling. When we reduced UBTOR function in neurons and a type of cancer cell line, cells grew longer neurites and had more cell colonies, respectively. On the other hand, overexpression of UBTOR in cancer cells inhibited colony formation. UBTOR stabilizes a key component of the mTOR complex called DEPTOR, and when UBTOR function is reduced, DEPTOR is lost, leading to increased mTOR signaling. We also found that when the ubtor gene was disrupted, the zebrafish developed faster tumors when a cancer-causing gene (HRAS) was introduced, and this was associated with increased mTOR signaling. Finally, we found that reducing UBTOR function in a mouse model of cancer also promoted tumor growth and increased mTOR signaling. These results show that UBTOR plays a critical role in controlling cell growth and cancer development via the mTOR signaling pathway.  \n",

To understand protein functions, scientists study how proteins work together in complexes. However, there is currently no map of which proteins work together in Trypanosomatida. Here, scientists used advanced methods to study how proteins work together in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei . They identified 128 protein complexes that included 716 proteins, many of which had not been studied before. The proteins in these complexes often work together in known pathways or are expressed similarly across different stages of the parasite's life cycle.

While lung infection is the most common , Mtb can also infect other parts of the body like lymph nodes ( LNs ). LNs are among the most common sites of Mtb infection in humans and macaques . Mtb-infected LNs can change the LN structure and function . We studied Mtb-infected LNs in macaques and found that different LNs can have different responses to Mtb infection . Rhesus macaques , who are more susceptible to Mtb infection than cynomolgus macaques , have more extensive LN pathology . Despite having the same amount of Mtb in their LNs , cynomolgus macaques controlled Mtb infection better than rhesus macaques . LNs are also generally poor at killing Mtb , even with drug treatment . LNs are important sites for Mtb persistence, serving as niches for Mtb growth and survival . Our study shows that LNs are not only important sites for immune activation during infection , but also play an important role in Mtb persistence .  \n",

The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has recently been identified as a host for a specific type of microsporidia, Nematocida parisii. To learn more about microsporidia infections in C . elegans, researchers collected wild nematodes from diverse environments and analyzed their microsporidian infections. They found that N . parisii is the most common microsporidian infecting C . elegans, but they also found six new species in the Nematocida genus, as well as two other genera that are genetically distinct from Nematocida . These new species provide a rich resource to study the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes and how they interact with their hosts.  \n",

Some studies have shown that these receptors work together in different ways to affect their function . However , there is limited information about the specific ways that these receptors interact and are affected by cholesterol . In this study , we used computer simulations to determine the specific ways that the receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 work together and are affected by cholesterol. We found that the receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 form similar homodimers (dimerization patterns), but differ significantly from the CC chemokine receptors . We also found that cholesterol affects the receptors in a subtype-specific way. Finally , we found that associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased sensitivity to cholesterol as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns .  \n",

However, there are several different forms of leishmaniasis, and some people with this condition may not show all of these typical symptoms. In this report, the authors describe a third form of systemic leishmaniasis that is characterized by atypical symptoms, such as lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) and anemia (low red blood cell count). To identify this new form of leishmaniasis, the authors performed specialized tests on blood and biopsy samples from patients suspected to have a weakened immune system. They found that 19.4% of these patients had normal laboratory test results but were found to have macrophages (a type of immune cell) that were loaded with parasites and were not functioning properly. These findings suggest that systemic leishmaniasis may present with a wider variety of symptoms than previously thought, and it may be more common than currently diagnosed. The authors recommend considering the diagnosis of atypical systemic leishmaniasis in any patient who has a weakened immune system and no clear immunologic defect.  \n",

The authors have collected disease-causing variants from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ( OMIM ) and the Human Genome Mutation Database ( HGMD ) and used them to identify and characterize pairs of variants at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins . The study found that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. The results show that information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.  \n",

The parasite, called Plasmodium falciparum, is exposed to different environments within the human body . These different environments can cause severe disease, but it is not clear how the parasite responds or is selected by these environments. To investigate this, researchers used a technique called RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze the genes expressed in 44 parasite isolates that caused either severe or uncomplicated malaria in patients from Papua, Indonesia. The parasites that caused severe malaria had changes in how their cells worked, including how they used glucose for energy, and how their genes were regulated. They also had lower levels of surface proteins called PfEMP1s, which are important targets of immunity against malaria. The study also found new associations between specific PfEMP1s and severe malaria, which can help identify potential targets for a vaccine against severe malaria.  \n",

However, antibodies against HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) have not been able to effectively prevent HIV from spreading . Scientists are investigating the use of strong, broadly-neutralizing antibodies to prevent HIV infections. In this study, researchers injected a specific type of antibody (IgG1 form) into rhesus monkeys via a virus-like particle (AAV) . The antibody was able to persist in the monkeys' bloodstream at high concentrations. However, the monkeys' bodies responded to the antibody and produced their own antibodies against the delivered antibody. This response limited how much antibody could be delivered and achieved. Despite the lower levels of delivered antibody, the monkeys showed significant protection against a difficult-to-neutralize virus, including lower levels of viral load at peak height and set point, and a delay in the time to peak viral load. The monkey with the highest level of delivered antibody completely resisted multiple virus challenges. While the study is promising, the researchers noted that the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be addressed in order for this approach to be fully effective.  \n",

However, we recently found that this is not always the case. In particular, the conformational motions of two important protein motors, myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, did not conform to this linear response. We used computer simulations to study these proteins and found that the linear response assumption failed in describing certain ligand-induced conformational motions. Additionally, the normal mode description, which is commonly used to analyze thermal fluctuations, also failed in describing certain functional mechanochemical motions. These results suggest that important assumptions made in the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered. Linear approximations may not be sufficient to capture important nonlinear dynamics.  \n",

In order to perform these functions, cells must be able to take in materials and substances from their environment. This process, called endocytosis , involves the cell engulfing and taking in molecules and particles from its surroundings. There are several different ways that cells can accomplish endocytosis, including through a process called clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) . The CIE process is believed to be regulated by a group of proteins known as caveolins and cavins . In this study, researchers set out to investigate the relationship between CIE and caveolins and cavins. They found that certain caveolins and cavins can inhibit CIE, meaning they can limit the amount of material taken into the cell through this process. They also found that these proteins have other functions besides just regulating CIE, and that their absence can have consequences for the cell's overall behavior and function. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of caveolins and cavins in regulating CIE and their other functions, and how their absence can affect the cell's overall behavior.  \n",

In these systems, a protein called a sensory histidine kinase receives a signal and then passes that signal along to another protein called a Receiver (REC) domain. The REC domain usually has a particular aspartate (Asp) residue that is phosphorylated by the sensory histidine kinase. In the past, scientists have noticed that some REC domains don't have this phosphorylatable Asp residue. Now, researchers have compiled all the REC domains that are missing their phosphorylatable Asp residue, and they have named this group of proteins \"Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains\". They have found that ALR domains are surprisingly common and are often linked to rare types of effects. The researchers also studied the structure and function of ALR domains in more detail and found that they have reorganized their active pockets to take on different roles or accept different types of signals. This research provides a new understanding of the ALR subclass of REC domains.  \n",

Most oHSVs gain cancer-specificity from deletions or mutations in genes that prevent the virus from being recognized by the immune system, but this also makes them weaker or less active. We developed a new type of oHSV called R-LM113 and R-115, which have no deletions or mutations, gain specificity by binding to tumor cells through a protein called HER2, and are fully-active. In this study, we tested R-LM113 and R-115 in immunocompetent mice with lung cancer. We found that both viruses were safe and effective at shrinking the primary tumor, and R-115 was even more effective. Furthermore, we found that R-115 caused the immune system to be more active against the cancer cells, and this lasted even after the primary tumor was gone. This is known as an \"abscopal\" effect, which means that the immune system is activated not only in the tumor where the virus was injected, but also in a second, untreated tumor. We also found that R-115 caused the immune system to break its \"tolerance\" of the cancer cells, which means that the immune system started to attack the cancer cells even in the absence of the virus. This is a sign that the virus is working as a vaccine to protect against future tumors. In summary, R-LM113 and R-115 are safe and effective at treating cancer, and cause the immune system to be more active against cancer cells even after the primary tumor is gone. This makes them promising candidates for future cancer treatments.  \n",

There is concern that the HIV infections in the Ad5 trial were caused by the vaccine vector itself rather than the HIV virus itself. In this study, we examined the HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by a different vaccine vector, ALVAC ( canarypox virus ), which was used in a vaccine trial in Thailand ( RV144 ). We found that CD4 T cells induced by ALVAC were much less susceptible to HIV infection than CD4 T cells induced by Ad5. This lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells was associated with a lack of surface expression of key HIV entry co-receptors, which are important for HIV infection. Interestingly, ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells also had a strong Th1 phenotype, which is associated with protection against HIV infection. On the other hand, Ad5-induced CD4 T cells had a strong Th2 phenotype, which is associated with poor protection against HIV infection. In addition, ALVAC and Ad5 induced distinct profiles of CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses, with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation while Ad5 induced CD4 T-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.  \n",

This has been thought to be a way for the female body to balance out the number of X chromosomes inherited from each parent . However , the rules that govern which X chromosome copy is silenced can vary between different species . Some species, such as mice, silence the X chromosome inherited from the father, while others, like humans, silence the X chromosome inherited from the mother . In this study, researchers used mathematical models to determine how various genetic factors, such as how genes are expressed relative to one another ( called dominance ), the degree to which genes are physically linked to one another ( called linkage ), the frequency of recombination between genes on the X chromosome, and how genes are expressed differently in males and females ( called sex-differential selection ), influence the rules of X inactivation . The results suggest that a combination of genetic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a wide range of X inactivation strategies, from one in which the X chromosome inherited from the father is always silenced, to one in which both X chromosomes are expressed equally in each tissue . This study provides a framework for understanding how the different rules of X inactivation have evolved across different species.  \n",

While many viruses have been known to be blocked by ZAP, a type of flavivirus called Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been thought to be resistant. Here , we tested whether JEV is actually resistant to ZAP. First, we found that overexpression of ZAP can block JEV infection, but not that of other types of flaviviruses like dengue virus or Zika virus. Then, we showed that ZAP can specifically target JEV RNA for degradation, and this is done through ZAP’s zinc-finger motifs. Finally, we found that JEV has a specific region of its RNA, especially in the 3′-end, that is targeted by ZAP, and this region is composed of a high content of CG dinucleotide and dumbbell structures. These findings reveal that JEV is actually sensitive to ZAP, and ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor by specifically binding to this JEV RNA region to fight against JEV infection.  \n",

RVFV is native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula but there is a risk that it could spread to non-endemic regions and cause devastating effects on livestock and humans . To better understand RVFV pathogenesis and immune response, researchers infected C57BL/6 mice with either a wild-type strain or a vaccine strain. The animals infected with the vaccine strain had little to no evidence of clinical disease or cytokine response. On the other hand, animals infected with the wild-type strain had severe disease characterized by lymphocyte and platelet depletion, a strong cytokine response, high virus titers, and tissue pathology. Lymphocyte and platelet depletion were indicative of disease onset and were correlated with increases in G-CSF production, suggesting that G-CSF may be a potential treatment. RVFV is known to be hepatotropic, and the virus resulted in significant clinical and histological data indicating hepatitis. However, the pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent, and instead, a chemokine response was evident, suggesting infiltration of immunoreactive cells such as neutrophils. In the brains of infected mice, a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, but with little pathology, indicating meningoencephalitis. These data suggest that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with liver necrosis and hepatitis, but the long-term course of disease for those that survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature, as observed in human disease and in the BALB/c mouse model .  \n",

A recent study by Xie et al. found that a protein called C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) becomes more active during chemotherapy in TNBC patients. CCL20 activates a specific type of cell called a breast cancer stem cell ( BCSC ) and makes it more likely to become resistant to chemotherapy. Additionally, CCL20 activates a protein called p65 nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) that helps BCSCs survive. The study also found that NF-κB activates the production of CCL20, creating a \"positive feedback loop\" that sustains the resistance of BCSCs to chemotherapy. The study suggests that CCL20 may be a useful predictor of whether a patient will respond to chemotherapy, and that blocking CCL20 or its effects could make TNBC patients more sensitive to chemotherapy.  \n",

Toxoplasma's ability to infect and manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport \"GRA\" proteins, which originate in unique secretory organelles called dense granules into the host cell. These GRA proteins have diverse roles in Toxoplasma's intracellular lifecycle, including co-opting crucial host cell functions and proteins, such as the cell cycle, c-Myc and p38 MAP kinase. Some of these GRA proteins, such as GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within which Toxoplasma replicates and are transported across the PV membrane (PVM) into the host cell. In this study, the authors identified additional proteins necessary for the transport of these GRAs into the host cell by screening Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus. They found that novel proteins MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell. These proteins are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1, which is cleaved by TgASP5 into two fragments. These three proteins are membrane-associated, and MYR3, but not MYR2, stably associates with MYR1. The authors also showed that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. Overall, these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell.  \n",

This process happens in several stages. First, the DNA is copied a few times upon infection. Next, during the cell cycle, the DNA is copied a few more times. Finally, when the cell differentiates (or matures), the DNA is copied a lot more. In this study, the authors found that HPV E2 binds to a protein called ORC2, which is a key player in starting the process of DNA replication. However, the authors did not find that ORC2 is important for the process of copying HPV DNA. In fact, the authors found that ORC2 actually suppresses the ability of E2 to start copying the DNA. This result is surprising because ORC2 is usually needed to start the process of copying DNA in cells. The authors also found that when the HPV E2 protein is overexpressed, it restricts the ability of ORC2 to start the process of copying DNA at known locations in the human genome. This result suggests that HPV E2 may be interfering with the process of copying DNA at these locations. These findings provide new insights into the complex relationship between viral proteins and cellular proteins during the process of viral DNA replication.  \n",

The disease is particularly prevalent in Central Asia and has a significant impact on human health and livelihoods . In low-income countries, many people live in urban areas and keep livestock in close proximity to their homes, increasing the risk of zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis spreading to humans. To investigate the prevalence of brucellosis in urban and peri-urban areas of Dushanbe, Tajikistan, researchers collected samples of cow milk from 564 cows and used a real-time PCR test to detect the presence of Brucella DNA. They found that 5.3% of the cows were infected with Brucella, and that the disease was present in both seropositive and seronegative cows. The researchers used DNA sequencing to determine that the two seronegative cows were likely infected with different species of Brucella. These findings highlight the need for developing new diagnostic strategies to identify false seronegative individuals and for further research to understand the spread of brucellosis in this region. The study also suggests that vaccination of cows with S19 and small ruminants with Rev 1 may be necessary to control the disease.  \n",

These accessory chromosomes can have repetitive elements, be transcriptionally repressed, and have many histone methylation marks, such as methylation of lysine 9 or 27 on histone 3 (H3K9me3 or H3K27me3). To better understand how these marks affect chromosome and genome stability in fungi, scientists deleted the genes responsible for producing these marks in the pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, which has up to eight accessory chromosomes. To investigate this, they used whole genome sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and RNA sequencing to compare the changes in genome and chromatin structure, as well as differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains. They found that the loss of H3K9me3 led to the relocalization of H3K27me3, formation of new chromosomes, and the activation of transposable elements. On the other hand, the loss of H3K27me3 actually increased the stability of accessory chromosomes, but this was not accompanied by large-scale changes in gene activity. The scientists concluded that H3K9me3 helps to maintain genome stability by preventing H3K27me3 from forming in certain regions of the genome. In other words, H3K27me3 helps to create a \"metastable\" state for certain regions of the genome, which are important but not essential for the fungus's survival.  \n",

To prevent the onset of rabies in people who have been exposed to it, they need to receive a special kind of vaccination called post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) as soon as possible. Unfortunately , life-saving vaccines and biologicals for rabies are hard to get and expensive, especially for the poorest people who are at the greatest risk of getting rabies . It is important to find ways to make it easier for people who have been exposed to rabies to get the vaccination they need, and to do it at a lower cost. In this study , researchers found that giving people the rabies vaccine through their skin ( intradermal delivery ) instead of through a muscle ( intramuscular delivery ) is just as effective but uses a lot less vaccine. This means that it is possible to treat more people with the same amount of vaccine, which could help solve problems with vaccine shortages. In addition , this study shows that using intradermal delivery is much cheaper than intramuscular delivery. The researchers suggest ways that governments and other organizations can pay for the vaccines so that more people can get them. This would make it easier for people to get the treatment they need to prevent rabies, and it would also be cheaper for organizations to provide this treatment. Overall, this study shows that it is important to use intradermal delivery of PEP to make it more accessible and affordable for people who have been exposed to rabies, and that this could lead to a reduction in human deaths from rabies.  \n",

In the current study, the authors looked at how Toxoplasma acquires nutrients from host cells. They found that lipid droplets (LDs) in the host cells are a source of lipids for the parasite, and that parasites are able to access and utilize lipids from LDs to build their own membranes and organelles. The authors also found that Toxoplasma uses an intravacuolar network of membranes to scavenge lipids from host LDs inside the PV. In addition, the authors discovered that when parasites are fed lipids, they create endocytic-like structures to absorb the excess lipids from the PV. The study highlights the importance of host LDs in supporting the growth of Toxoplasma, and the parasite's ability to acquire lipids from these organelles.  \n",

There is concern that fasciolosis is becoming more common among humans, making it an emerging zoonotic disease. Currently, chemotherapy is the primary way to control fasciolosis, but it is not always effective due to the presence of resistant parasites. To find new ways to control this disease, scientists have searched for drugs that can kill the juvenile and mature stages of the parasites. In this study, the researchers found chalcones, which are a type of flavonoid, could kill juvenile liver flukes by interacting with key parts of the enzymes that digest proteins. One chalcone, C34, was particularly effective and reduced the ability of the young larvae to penetrate the gut wall and decreased their viability in the laboratory. This is an exciting discovery, as it provides a new potential treatment for fasciolosis. The researchers hope that this finding can lead to the development of new drugs to control fasciolosis and potentially other helminthic diseases.  \n",

These cells send the information to the inner retina. Using imaging techniques, we studied how these cells transmit information about fast and slow changes in light intensity. We found that the size of the synaptic terminal is an important property that affects how fast and slow changes in light intensity are transmitted. Each bipolar cell has multiple terminals of different sizes, and smaller terminals transmit faster and more effectively. Modeling the global calcium dynamics shows that the size of the presynaptic compartment is directly linked to the adaptability of these neurons. This suggests that bipolar cells can transmit different components of the visual signal through synaptic terminals with different adaptational properties.  \n",

Fluorescence microscopy ( FM ) can detect many different molecules in synapses quickly and cheaply, but it is difficult to distinguish between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals. Electron microscopy ( EM ) is the best tool for seeing individual synapses clearly, but it is slow, expensive, and cannot tell which molecules are in the synapse. To address this issue, researchers have developed a new method for detecting synapses using fluorescence microscopy images and comparing them to electron microscopy images. They found that their new method was just as good as human annotators at detecting synapses and reproducing important features of synapse distributions, such as the types of molecules in the synapse and the number of synapses in a certain region of the brain. This new tool is likely to be useful for analyzing standard fluorescence microscopy images and could help scientists discover new types of synapses.  \n",

Zinc moves in and out of cells through two families of transporters, called ZnT and ZIP . One of these transporters, called ZnT2, is responsible for zinc transport during breastfeeding . However, we do not know exactly how ZnT2 works. In this study, we have created a model of how ZnT2 works and have shown that it transports zinc using the proton gradient in acidic vesicles. Using special inhibitors and markers to track the pH inside vesicles, we have shown that when we add zinc to acidic vesicles, the vesicles get less acidic. This happens because ZnT2 takes in protons and gives away zinc. We have also calculated the math behind this process and found that ZnT2 exchanges two protons for every zinc ion. Overall, ZnT2 is an important transporter that helps us maintain our zinc levels and overall health.  \n",

During this process, cells use a machinery called the replication fork to move down the DNA strand and make a copy of it . 14-3-3 proteins are able to sense when the replication fork is not working properly and respond by activating special proteins called checkpoints . Exonuclease 1 ( Exo1 ) is a protein that processes stalled replication forks when the checkpoints are not working . We now know that 14-3-3 proteins bind to Exo1 in both yeast and human cells . When 14-3-3 proteins are missing in yeast, the checkpoint does not properly activate Exo1 and more DNA damage occurs at the stalled forks. We have also found that 14-3-3 proteins help to promote the movement of the replication fork under stressful conditions such as low levels of nutrients in the cell. This suggests that 14-3-3 proteins play an important role in making sure that DNA is copied accurately during cell division.  \n",

To help them study this, they developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC from all lymphoid organs. They used this antibody to deplete pDC before HIV-1 infection in a humanized mouse model. During acute HIV-1 infection, they found that the induction of type I interferons (IFN-I) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished in pDC-depleted mice. This was consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, as HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1-induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs, but not the blood, was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication. This was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells. The scientists conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis. These findings suggest that pDC depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retroviral treatment.  \n",

However, whether Nrf2 activation affects human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection is unknown. A substance called sulforaphane ( SFN ), found in cruciferous vegetables after injury, activates Nrf2 to reprogram gene expression. We have found that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. This blockade of infection is due to Nrf2 activation, which is mobilized by SFN. We also found that SFN treatment blocks HIV infection after entry but before 2-LTR circles are formed, and that neither SAMHD1 nor MX2 are upregulated. This suggests that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection and highlights a novel way to trigger this inhibition.  \n",

During a study in Kenya , researchers found that about 76% of pregnant women had at least one geohelminth infection . Many of these women lived in areas with poor water supply and sanitation . The most common geohelminths found in the study were Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura. Although these infections were common, the researchers did not find any major negative effects on the pregnant women, such as clinical symptoms or weight loss. However, hookworm infections were associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference and lower hemoglobin levels in women with high egg counts. This suggests that hookworm infections may have some negative effects on the health of pregnant women, especially when the infection is severe. The researchers also found that women with Ascaris lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasites in their blood than women without Ascaris lumbricoides. This suggests that geohelminth infections may have some protective effects against malaria parasites. Overall, the study highlights the importance of addressing geohelminth infections in pregnant women in areas with poor water supply and sanitation.  \n",

In this study, we investigated whether mycolactone also affects the inflammatory responses of cells involved in pain perception and maintenance, such as sensory neurons, Schwann cells (which wrap around nerve fibers), and microglia (a type of immune cell found in the brain). We found that mycolactone inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by these cells within the first 24 hours of exposure, without affecting their viability. Additionally, mycolactone prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia. To investigate whether mycolactone affects neuroinflammation in vivo, we used a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve. Mycolactone was injected daily for three days into the spinal canal, and we found that it decreased the local production of inflammatory cytokines without causing detectable cytotoxicity. In summary, mycolactone suppressed the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia without affecting their viability, which may partially explain the analgesic properties of mycolactone.  \n",

In Guinea, researchers collected samples from 425 individuals, including 232 HAT cases, 79 subjects with a long-lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls. They then analyzed the association of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes with HAT outcome. The IL6 gene was found to be associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease (p = 0.0001, OR = 0.39, CI95 = [0.24–0.63], BONF = 0.0034). Similarly, the MIF gene was found to be associated with an increased risk of developing HAT (p = 0.0239, OR = 1.65, CI95 = [1.07–2.53], BONF = 0.6697), although this association did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. The MIF gene was also found to be associated with latent infections (p = 0.0077, OR = 1.86, CI95 = [1.18–2.95], BONF = 0.2157). The APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) was found to be associated with a higher risk of developing HAT (p = 0.0011, OR = 2.70, CI95 = [1.49–4.91], BONF = 0.0301), while the APOL1 G1 polymorphism was found to be associated with a lower risk of developing HAT (p = 0.0005, OR = 0.45, CI95 = [0.29–0.70], BONF = 0.0129). No other associations were found with other candidate genes. Overall, these results suggest that host genetic factors are involved in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea, and may lead to the development of new control tools.

Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation .</td>\n",

       "      <td>The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design .</td>\n",

Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Between 2000–2007 , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1 . 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs ( albendazole , ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine ) to all at-risk for 4–6 years . Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health .</td>\n",

Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD .</td>\n",

While bulk kinetic measurements rely on discrete state-like approximations to the energy landscape , single-molecule methods can project the free energy onto specific coordinates . With measures of the diffusion , one may establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape . We used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome ( 2 . 1 million atoms; 1 . 3 microseconds ) to provide this bridge for specific conformational events associated with the process of tRNA translocation . Starting from a pre-translocation configuration , we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function . Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation were then used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape . This analysis , in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation , provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation . While this analysis was performed for a particular kinetic scheme of translocation , the quantitative framework is general and may be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states .</td>\n",

To explore genetic profiles of MTCs , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2 . Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced . We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples . The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene , which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ) , serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ) , v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ) , mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ) , Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ) and MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ) . We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH . To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5’ fusion partner of ALK , customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients . Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusions were identified . Additional PCR analysis , followed by Sanger sequencing , confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion , indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion . Notably , a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor , crizotinib . In conclusion , we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC . Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors . Furthermore , the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy .</td>\n",

The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission , prognosis at individual level and rate of transformation to symptomatic VL/Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) needs to be evaluated . Asymptomatic cases were diagnosed by active mass survey in eight tribal villages by detecting antileishmanial antibody using rK39 based rapid diagnostic kits and followed up for three years to observe the pattern of sero-conversion and disease transformation . Out of 2890 total population , 2603 were screened . Antileishmanial antibody was detected in 185 individuals of them 96 had a history of VL/PKDL and 89 without such history . Seventy nine such individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis and ten as active VL with a ratio of 7 . 9:1 . Out of 79 asymptomatic cases 2 were lost to follow up as they moved to other places . Amongst asymptomatically infected persons , disease transformation in 8/77 ( 10 . 39% ) and sero-conversion in 62/77 ( 80 . 52% ) cases were noted . Seven ( 9 . 09% ) remained sero-positive even after three years . Progression to clinical disease among asymptomatic individuals was taking place at any time up to three years after the baseline survey . If there are no VL /PKDL cases for two or more years , it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years , if there are such asymptomatic cases . So , asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme that has been initiated by three adjoining endemic countries .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangements ( GCRs ) can lead to genetic diseases and the development of cancer . We previously demonstrated that introduction of the repetitive retrotransposon Ty912 onto a nonessential chromosome arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to increased genome instability predominantly due to increased rates of formation of monocentric nonreciprocal translocations . In this study , we adapted Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ) to analyze a large numbers of these GCRs . Using MLPA , we found that the distribution of translocations induced by the presence of Ty912 in a wild-type strain was nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes , even though there were 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S . cerevisiae genome . While the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination , we observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements . The formation of these RAD52-independent translocations did not require the Rad51 or Rad59 homologous pairing proteins or the Rad1–Rad10 endonuclease complex that processes branched DNAs during recombination . Finally , we found that defects in ASF1-RTT109–dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 ( H3K56 ) resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications , and resulted in aneuploidy that tended to occur simultaneously with GCRs . Overall , we found that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Similarly to protein folding , the association of two proteins is driven by a free energy funnel , determined by favorable interactions in some neighborhood of the native state . We describe a docking method based on stochastic global minimization of funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions ( SE ( 3 ) ) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains . The method , called semi-definite programming-based underestimation ( SDU ) , employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling . While SDU effectively minimizes functions with funnel-shaped basins , its application to docking in the rotational and translational space SE ( 3 ) is not straightforward due to the geometry of that space . We introduce a strategy that uses separate independent variables for side-chain optimization , center-to-center distance of the two proteins , and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules . The removal of the center-to-center distance turns out to vastly improve the efficiency of the search , because the five-dimensional space now exhibits a well-behaved energy surface suitable for underestimation . This algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima and shows similarity to the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions . Results for standard protein docking benchmarks establish that in this space the free energy landscape is a funnel in a reasonably broad neighborhood of the native state and that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation while achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods .</td>\n",

Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation . \n",

Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design . \n",

Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease . \n",
       "3     Between 2000–2007 , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1 . 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs ( albendazole , ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine ) to all at-risk for 4–6 years . Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health . \n",

Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD . \n",

While bulk kinetic measurements rely on discrete state-like approximations to the energy landscape , single-molecule methods can project the free energy onto specific coordinates . With measures of the diffusion , one may establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape . We used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome ( 2 . 1 million atoms; 1 . 3 microseconds ) to provide this bridge for specific conformational events associated with the process of tRNA translocation . Starting from a pre-translocation configuration , we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function . Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation were then used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape . This analysis , in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation , provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation . While this analysis was performed for a particular kinetic scheme of translocation , the quantitative framework is general and may be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states . \n",

To explore genetic profiles of MTCs , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2 . Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced . We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples . The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene , which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ) , serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ) , v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ) , mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ) , Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ) and MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ) . We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH . To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5’ fusion partner of ALK , customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients . Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusions were identified . Additional PCR analysis , followed by Sanger sequencing , confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion , indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion . Notably , a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor , crizotinib . In conclusion , we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC . Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors . Furthermore , the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy . \n",

The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission , prognosis at individual level and rate of transformation to symptomatic VL/Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) needs to be evaluated . Asymptomatic cases were diagnosed by active mass survey in eight tribal villages by detecting antileishmanial antibody using rK39 based rapid diagnostic kits and followed up for three years to observe the pattern of sero-conversion and disease transformation . Out of 2890 total population , 2603 were screened . Antileishmanial antibody was detected in 185 individuals of them 96 had a history of VL/PKDL and 89 without such history . Seventy nine such individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis and ten as active VL with a ratio of 7 . 9:1 . Out of 79 asymptomatic cases 2 were lost to follow up as they moved to other places . Amongst asymptomatically infected persons , disease transformation in 8/77 ( 10 . 39% ) and sero-conversion in 62/77 ( 80 . 52% ) cases were noted . Seven ( 9 . 09% ) remained sero-positive even after three years . Progression to clinical disease among asymptomatic individuals was taking place at any time up to three years after the baseline survey . If there are no VL /PKDL cases for two or more years , it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years , if there are such asymptomatic cases . So , asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme that has been initiated by three adjoining endemic countries . \n",

We previously demonstrated that introduction of the repetitive retrotransposon Ty912 onto a nonessential chromosome arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to increased genome instability predominantly due to increased rates of formation of monocentric nonreciprocal translocations . In this study , we adapted Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ) to analyze a large numbers of these GCRs . Using MLPA , we found that the distribution of translocations induced by the presence of Ty912 in a wild-type strain was nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes , even though there were 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S . cerevisiae genome . While the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination , we observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements . The formation of these RAD52-independent translocations did not require the Rad51 or Rad59 homologous pairing proteins or the Rad1–Rad10 endonuclease complex that processes branched DNAs during recombination . Finally , we found that defects in ASF1-RTT109–dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 ( H3K56 ) resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications , and resulted in aneuploidy that tended to occur simultaneously with GCRs . Overall , we found that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy . \n",

We describe a docking method based on stochastic global minimization of funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions ( SE ( 3 ) ) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains . The method , called semi-definite programming-based underestimation ( SDU ) , employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling . While SDU effectively minimizes functions with funnel-shaped basins , its application to docking in the rotational and translational space SE ( 3 ) is not straightforward due to the geometry of that space . We introduce a strategy that uses separate independent variables for side-chain optimization , center-to-center distance of the two proteins , and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules . The removal of the center-to-center distance turns out to vastly improve the efficiency of the search , because the five-dimensional space now exhibits a well-behaved energy surface suitable for underestimation . This algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima and shows similarity to the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions . Results for standard protein docking benchmarks establish that in this space the free energy landscape is a funnel in a reasonably broad neighborhood of the native state and that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation while achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods . \n",

       "      <td>The expression of genes within a population is different for every individual. These differences can be due to changes in gene regulation. It is important to understand how these changes occur, and how they are related to gene expression. Most research on this topic has focused on the effects of genetic changes on the regions of DNA that control gene expression. However, less is known about the role of RNA processing in regulating gene expression. This is because it is difficult to identify functional elements in the regions of DNA that are not translated into proteins. In this study, researchers conducted an analysis of the ends of RNA molecules in lymphoblastoid cells from different human individuals. They found that the positions of these ends were not randomly located, but rather preferred to be close to certain regions of DNA that control gene expression. The usage of different RNA length forms and motifs in these regions varied across different individuals, and genetic changes in these regions were significant predictors of the expression levels of the genes. Independent experiments confirmed that genetic changes in these regions affected the expression levels of the genes. The researchers also looked at the gene IRF5, and how natural genetic variations in RNA processing affected the regulation of this gene in response to antigen stimulation. The researchers found that two mechanisms are at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of different 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate. The researchers suggest that the strategy of combining observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will be a useful tool in efforts to understand the human genome.</td>\n",
       "      <td>In our bodies, different genes have different amounts of expression, or the amount of protein they make. The reason for this variation is not well understood, and a lot of work has been done to understand how genetic changes affect the amount of protein produced. This work has mostly focused on the regions of DNA that are upstream of the protein-making part of the gene, which are called regulatory regions. These regions are important for controlling the amount of protein that is made from the gene. However, not much is known about how another type of genetic variation, called RNA 3′-end variation, affects gene expression. RNA 3′-end variation refers to changes in the length of the tail-like structure at the end of the RNA molecule that is produced from a gene. The aim of this work was to study how RNA 3′-end variation affects gene expression. The authors used samples of blood cells from different people and compared the length of the tails of RNA molecules that were produced from different genes. They found that the length of the tails varied between people, and that some of these differences were due to changes in the DNA sequence that affect how long the tail is. The authors then studied how the variation in the length of the tails affected gene expression. They found that the length of the tails of RNA molecules can change the amount of protein that is made from the gene, and that some of these differences were due to changes in the DNA sequence. The authors then focused on a specific gene that plays an important role in the immune system, and found that natural variation in the length of the tails of RNA molecules affects how the gene responds to antigen stimulation. This variation is due to differences in the DNA sequence of the gene. The authors conclude that the strategy of comparing the lengths of RNA molecules from different people with the amounts of protein they produce can help us understand how genetic variation affects gene expression.</td>\n",

In this study, researchers used advanced technology to analyze the immune response of vaccinated animals.

This broadened the immune response to include more diverse regions of the virus, which is associated with better protection.

They found that, in the acute phase of infection, the CD8 T cell response is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes. However, as the infection progresses, widespread sequence evolution and viral escape occur. Despite this escape, the authors show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes, a phenomenon called anentropic specificity. This expansion of anentropic specificity and increased response depth correlate with protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. These findings render SIVΔnef as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Candida albicans causes mucosal infections, which are one of the most common forms of fungal diseases. The immune system protects against these infections, but we do not know how to induce immunity against them. We used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) to study this. We found that the immune response is regulated by a molecule called interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R). IL-1R is important for controlling fungal growth at the beginning of the infection. This happens because IL-1R affects neutrophils in two ways: it helps neutrophils reach the site of the infection and it helps new neutrophils be made in the bone marrow. IL-1R-deficient mice had problems controlling fungal growth because they did not produce enough of a molecule called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and they did not make enough of a molecule called chemokines. G-CSF is made by endothelial cells, which are a type of cell found in the mouth. Chemokines are made by keratinocytes, which are another type of cell found in the mouth. Keratinocytes release IL-1α, which is important for G-CSF production by endothelial cells. We confirmed these findings in vitro using a new type of mouse cell called a keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. Together, these data show that IL-1R is important for regulating the immune response to fungal infections in the mouth and for protecting the host from these infections.</td>\n",

However, our understanding of how the immune system fights off these infections is incomplete. In this study , we used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) to investigate the role of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling in antifungal immunity. We found that IL-1R is critical for controlling fungal growth during the early stages of infection. IL-1R affects neutrophils, which are important cells of the immune system, in two ways. First, it helps recruit neutrophils to the site of infection. Second, it mobilizes newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. Without IL-1R, mice had defects in chemokine production at the site of infection and in secretion of a factor that helps generate new neutrophils in the bloodstream. We discovered that endothelial cells, which line blood vessels, are the primary source of this factor and that they are influenced by IL-1R. Our findings suggest a new link between IL-1 and the production of new neutrophils during fungal infections, and they highlight two complementary mechanisms that coordinate the neutrophil response to protect the host from disease.</td>\n",

Thus , the mechanism governing the neutrophil response to C . albicans remained to be determined . Here , we demonstrate an essential role of IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling in the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation to the infected tissue via enhanced secretion of chemokines and increased output of neutrophils from the bone marrow . We found that IL-1α is released from keratinocytes upon invasion of C . albicans and acts on endothelial cells to induce the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , a key trigger of emergency granulopoiesis .

This disease is caused by a parasite and can lead to disabilities and other serious health problems. Between 2000 and 2007, the GPELF gave more than 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million people, which were given through an annual mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs (albendazole, ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine) to everyone at risk. \\nIt is important to know how much money this program saves by preventing lymphatic filariasis. To do this, researchers looked at how many people got treatments and how many people got better as a result of these treatments. They also looked at the cost of treating lymphatic filariasis, the cost of people not being able to work because of the disease, and the cost of treating people who were sick. They found that over 20 years, the program will save about $21.8 billion by treating about 31.4 million people. About $2.3 billion of this money comes from people who will never get lymphatic filariasis because they were born in areas where the disease is now gone. Another $19.5 billion comes from people who already have the disease, but will not get any worse because of the program. This program will also save health systems about $2.2 billion because people will not need to be treated as much anymore. \\nIn conclusion, treating lymphatic filariasis with the GPELF program saves a lot of money. This is because the cost of the program is low, due in part to the donation of drugs from the pharmaceutical industry. The economic return on this program is very high, which means that it is a great investment in public health.</td>\n",

Calculating the resulting economic benefits of this achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to understand the Programme's impact on the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits, the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with disease prevention were then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were used, including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization, International Monetary Fund, and International Labour Organization. An estimated $21.8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF. Of this total, over $2.3 billion is realized by protecting nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of being born into areas freed of LF transmission. Similarly, more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease, resulting in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately $19.5 billion. In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity save the health systems of endemic countries approximately $2.2 billion. MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits, and with favorable program implementation costs, it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high, making it an excellent investment in global health.</td>\n",

Our study estimates that US$21 . 8 billion will be gained among individuals benefitting from just the first 8 years of the Global Programme , and an additional US$2 . 2 billion will be saved by the health systems of endemic countries . Treating endemic populations is possible at very low cost – particularly because of the generous drug donations from two pharmaceutical companies – but results in enormous economic benefits . Findings from this study yield a much clearer understanding the GPELF's full economic impact and strengthen the conviction that it is a ‘best buy’ in global health .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Between 2000–2007 , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1 . 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs ( albendazole , ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine ) to all at-risk for 4–6 years . Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health .</td>\n",

Research has shown that certain genetic mutations that cause GD can also increase the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, researchers created a type of fish called medaka that lacked a protein called Gaucher disease-related protein (GCase), which is usually responsible for breaking down GC. Surprisingly, these GCase-deficient fish lived for several months, allowing researchers to study the development of GD-like symptoms in more detail. The fish showed many of the same symptoms as people with neuronopathic GD, including the buildup of Gaucher-like cells in the brain, progressive nerve cell loss, and microglia (a type of brain cell). These symptoms were caused by lysosomal problems in nerve cells and the accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein in swollen nerve cells. However, when researchers tried to remove alpha-synuclein from the fish, this did not improve their symptoms or extend their lifespan. This study provides new insights into the development of GD-like symptoms and the role of alpha-synuclein in GD.</td>\n",

Humans and mice with no glucocerebrosidase activity die at birth, but the GBA-/- fish lived for months. This allowed scientists to study the progression of the disease. The fish had symptoms that resembled Gaucher disease in humans, including infiltration of Gaucher cells into the brain, neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation. Unexpectedly, disrupting a protein called alpha-synuclein did not improve the disease symptoms. This study shows that the GBA-/- fish can be used as a new model of Gaucher disease, and that alpha-synuclein may not play a major role in the development of the disease.</td>\n",

This means that the body is not able to produce as many T cells as it should. In addition, the body is also not able to produce a certain type of molecule called IL-10, which is important for fighting infections.

Here , we show that the impaired T cell response to L . monocytogenes confined within a phagosome is not merely a consequence of inefficient antigen presentation , but is the result of direct suppression of the adaptive response . This suppression limited not only the adaptive response to vacuole-confined L . monocytogenes , but negated the response to bacteria within the cytosol .

Five of these variants were found primarily in POAG patients, and one was found only in healthy individuals.

The results showed that five of the six variants were hypomorphic or null, meaning they had less or no protein-making ability, while the remaining variant was benign. One of the variants in the SIX6 enhancer increased SIX6 gene expression and disrupted its regulation. In addition, the study identified a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent on SIX6 genotype: patients homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the non-risk allele.

There are different types of glaucoma, but the most common one is called primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). POAG has a complex genetic basis, meaning that it is caused by a combination of different genes. Previous research has identified a gene called SIX6 that may be involved in POAG. Now, researchers have sequenced the SIX6 gene in people with POAG and those without the disease, and they have found six variants, or changes, in the gene that may be linked to POAG. To test whether these variants are harmful or not, the researchers used zebrafish to look at how the variants affected the size of the eye and the structure of the optic nerve. They also found a clinical feature in people with POAG that seems to be linked to the SIX6 gene. This feature is a thinner layer of nerve cells in the back of the eye.

To investigate this, we used mathematical models to analyze the quorum sensing system of Escherichia coli ( E . coli ), which uses a molecule called AI-2 to communicate . We found that this system is controlled by a combination of negative and positive feedback loops, which are a type of regulatory mechanism that allow for communication within a network. These feedback loops help to balance the system by controlling the levels of AI-2 and the activity of other proteins involved in QS. We also found that a previously unknown negative feedback loop plays a key role in the functioning of the E . coli QS system. Finally, we developed a simple mathematical model that helped us to understand how these feedback loops interact and control the overall behavior of the QS system. By studying QS in this way, we can better understand how bacterial groups behave and develop strategies to control or disrupt these behaviors if necessary.</td>\n",

One particular form of communication in E . coli is through a universal signaling molecule known as autoinducer 2 . Although the importance of this form of cell-cell interaction has been recognized in the formation of biofilms and virulent infections , the mechanisms by which this form of communication is regulated is still not well understood . In this paper , we presented a method of unraveling these mechanisms by using a combination of experimental work and mathematical models . We took apart the network architecture and isolated the different components . The examination of these isolated sub-networks provided us with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control and regulate bacterial quorum sensing . We were also able to predict new network interactions with the help of our mathematical models . This bottom up approach , combined with our modeling efforts , proved effective in unraveling the mechanisms of quorum sensing in E . coli .</td>\n",

While genetic “switching” phenomena are a common feature , their mechanistic underpinnings have remained elusive . The interplay between circuit components and their regulation are intertwined and embedded . Observable phenotypes are complex and context dependent . We employed a combination of experimental work and mathematical models to decipher network connectivity and signal transduction in the autoinducer-2 ( AI-2 ) quorum sensing system of E . coli . Negative and positive feedback mechanisms were examined by separating the network architecture into sub-networks . A new unreported negative feedback interaction was hypothesized and tested via a simple mathematical model .

Our simple model allowed mechanistic understanding of the interplay among regulatory sub-structures and their contributions to the overall native functioning network .

In this study, researchers looked at how having worms called Schistosoma haematobium and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) like Trichuris trichiura and hookworms might affect the risk of getting malaria. The study was done in school-aged children living in rural areas in Gabon. Researchers used different tests to see if the children had malaria parasites, S. haematobium eggs, and STH eggs. The children were tested for malaria at the beginning of the study and then the researchers tracked who got malaria over time and how long it took for each person to get it. The results showed that having S. haematobium and STH increased the risk of getting malaria, but having S. haematobium and STH together made the risk even higher. The study also found that children who got malaria were younger if they had S. haematobium than the children who did not get malaria.

They found that having IRF-5 turned on the expression of genes that made certain proteins, including IL-6 and TNF, that help fight the infection. They then wanted to see how this IRF-5-mediated inflammation affected CD8+ T cell responses.

When the scientists used mice that lacked HIF-1α in these dendritic cells, they found that CD8+ T cells expanded more, the IL-12 expression by these dendritic cells increased, and these mice had a lower splenic parasite burden.

In lis mutants , accessory cells differentiate gametic cell fate , indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate . The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells .

However, understanding the reasons behind people's shoe usage can help in developing effective strategies to ensure consistent use of shoes. Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, a research group analyzed the factors influencing shoe use among children in a rural highland community in Ethiopia. Through focus groups, interviews and case studies, the researchers found that while people understood the benefits of wearing shoes, there were numerous practical and social obstacles preventing them from doing so. For example, many people could not afford multiple pairs of shoes, so they only wore shoes for special occasions or for older children.

Shoe-wearing norms were said to be changing , with going barefoot increasingly seen as ‘shameful’ . Shoes were thought to confer dignity as well as protection against injury and cold . However , many practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice . Limited financial resources meant that people were neither able to purchase more than one pair of shoes to ensure their longevity nor afford shoes of the preferred quality . As a result of this limited access , shoes were typically preserved for special occasions and might not be provided for children until they reached a certain age . While some barriers ( for example fit of shoe and fear of labeling through use of a certain type of shoe ) may be applicable only to certain diseases , underlying structural level barriers related to poverty ( for example price , quality , unsuitability for daily activities and low risk perception ) are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs .

The researchers studied this phenomenon in yeast cells using genetic and chemical changes, as well as single-cell measurements of how well each cell grows and how it responds to stress. They found that the amount of a molecule called cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its effects on specific proteins are important for this nongenetic heterogeneity.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, scientists have found that growth rate correlates with susceptibility to heat stress in individual cells. By using genetic and chemical manipulations, combined with high-throughput single-cell assays, they found that heterogeneity in the levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its effects on the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway are the underlying cause of this nongenetic heterogeneity. Lower levels of cAMP in cells correspond to slower growth rates, and a reporter of PKA pathway activity also correlates with growth rates in individual cells. The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 have different roles in nongenetic heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in growth rate requires both paralogs, but only Msn2 is required for heterogeneity in stress tolerance. Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in the cAMP-PKA pathway or by culturing wild-type cells with cAMP analogs or PKA inhibitors affects the survival of acute heat stress. Perturbations that increase cAMP levels reduce the slower-growing subpopulation and increase susceptibility to acute heat stress, whereas PKA inhibition slows growth and increases susceptibility to acute heat stress. Loss of Msn2 reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the correlation in individual cells between growth rate and acute-stress survival, suggesting a major role for the Msn2 pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity but also a residual benefit of slow growth.

Notably , compared to lung granulomas , LNs are generally poor at killing Mtb , even with drug treatment . Granulomas that form in LNs lack B cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures , disrupt LN structure by pushing out T cells and B cells , introduce large numbers of macrophages that can serve as niches for Mtb , and destroy normal vasculature . Our data support that LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection , but also serve as important sites for persistence of significant numbers of Mtb bacilli .</td>\n",

This research has discovered 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections and named six new species in the Nematocida genus. These microsporidian infections are highly diverse and widespread in wild Caenorhabditis elegans worms. The research has also identified two subclades of microsporidians that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, which belong to the clade of microsporidians that includes human pathogens. The microsporidians found in this study replicate in different parts of their host worms and use different mechanisms to exit their host cells.

Interestingly , unlike Nematocida , these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens . All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells , except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host . At the subcellular level in the infected host cell , spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane , instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida . Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia , narrow for others: indeed , some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp . 3 , and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp . 3 do not infect O . tipulae . We also show that N . ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C . elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species , suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response .

This process is independent of caveolin-1, which is another important component of caveolae. We have also found that caveolin-1 and cavin-1/cavin-3 inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon overexpression. Furthermore, the CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking caveolin-1 and Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3. We have also found that Cavin-1 can regulate the activity of a key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway, Cdc42.

       "      <td>The human body is made up of many different types of cells that each have their own unique functions and properties. In order to perform these functions, cells must be able to take in materials and substances from their environment. This process, called endocytosis , involves the cell engulfing and taking in molecules and particles from its surroundings. There are several different ways that cells can accomplish endocytosis, including through a process called clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) . The CIE process is believed to be regulated by a group of proteins known as caveolins and cavins . In this study, researchers set out to investigate the relationship between CIE and caveolins and cavins. They found that certain caveolins and cavins can inhibit CIE, meaning they can limit the amount of material taken into the cell through this process. They also found that these proteins have other functions besides just regulating CIE, and that their absence can have consequences for the cell's overall behavior and function. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of caveolins and cavins in regulating CIE and their other functions, and how their absence can affect the cell's overall behavior.</td>\n",

While the best understood endocytic pathway uses clathrin , recent years have seen a great increase in our understanding of clathrin-independent endocytic pathways . Here we characterize the crosstalk between caveolae , flask-shaped specialized microdomains present at the plasma membrane , and a second clathrin-independent pathway , the CLIC/GEEC Cdc42-regulated endocytic pathway . These pathways are segregated in migrating cells with caveolae at the rear and CLIC/GEEC endocytosis at the leading edge . Here we find that specific caveolar proteins , caveolins and cavins , can also negatively regulate the CLIC/GEEC pathway . With the help of several techniques , including quantitative electron microscopy analysis and real-time live-cell imaging , we demonstrate that expression of caveolar proteins affects early carrier formation , causes cellular lipid changes , and changes the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway , Cdc42 . The functional consequences of loss of caveolar proteins on the CLIC/GEEC pathway included inhibition of polarized cell migration and increased endocytosis in tissue explants .</td>\n",

Caveolins and cavins are crucial components of caveolae , specialized microdomains that also constitute an endocytic route . Here we show that specific caveolar proteins are independently acting negative regulators of clathrin-independent endocytosis . Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 , but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4 , are potent inhibitors of the clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment ( CLIC/GEEC ) endocytic pathway , in a process independent of caveola formation . Caveolin-1 ( CAV1 ) and CAV3 also inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon over-expression . Expression of caveolar protein leads to reduction in formation of early CLIC/GEEC carriers , as detected by quantitative electron microscopy analysis . Furthermore , the CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV1/Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 . Inhibition by caveolins can be mimicked by the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and is associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid microdomain components , as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) studies . In the absence of cavins ( and caveolae ) CAV1 is itself endocytosed preferentially through the CLIC/GEEC pathway , but the pathway loses polarization and sorting attributes with consequences for membrane dynamics and endocytic polarization in migrating cells and adult muscle tissue . We also found that noncaveolar Cavin-1 can act as a modulator for the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway , Cdc42 . This work provides new insights into the regulation of noncaveolar clathrin-independent endocytosis by specific caveolar proteins , illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways . We show for the first time a role for specific cavins in regulating the CLIC/GEEC pathway , provide a new tool to study this pathway , identify caveola-independent functions of the cavins and propose a novel mechanism for inhibition of the CLIC/GEEC pathway by caveolin .</td>\n",

However, it is unclear how many REC domains lack this phosphorylatable Asp residue, what their functions are, and how they are regulated in the absence of the phosphorylatable Asp residue. In this study, we collected all REC domains that lack a phosphorylatable Asp residue and renamed them Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains. We found that ALRs are surprisingly common and are more likely to be attached to rare effector outputs. By analyzing available ALR atomic structures, combined with genetic and biochemical data, we suggest that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or to accommodate input signals other than phosphorylation of the aspartate residue, while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface.</td>\n",

In order to make these viruses selective for cancer cells, scientists often remove certain genes that allow the virus to fight against the host's immune response. As a result, these viruses are frequently weakened or extremely weakened. We have developed a new type of oncolytic virus that is fully virulent in cancer cells but not in other cells in the body. These viruses have been retargeted to specifically attack cancer cells with high levels of a particular protein called HER2. In this study, we tested the safety and efficacy of these retargeted viruses in immunocompetent mice with cancer. We found that these viruses were safe and effective at shrinking the primary tumor. Additionally, the mice that survived the primary tumor were protected from a second tumor in the opposite side.

Most oHSVs gain cancer-specificity from deletions or mutations in genes that prevent the virus from being recognized by the immune system, but this also makes them weaker or less active. We developed a new type of oHSV called R-LM113 and R-115, which have no deletions or mutations, gain specificity by binding to tumor cells through a protein called HER2, and are fully-active. In this study, we tested R-LM113 and R-115 in immunocompetent mice with lung cancer. We found that both viruses were safe and effective at shrinking the primary tumor, and R-115 was even more effective. Furthermore, we found that R-115 caused the immune system to be more active against the cancer cells, and this lasted even after the primary tumor was gone. This is known as an \"abscopal\" effect, which means that the immune system is activated not only in the tumor where the virus was injected, but also in a second, untreated tumor. We also found that R-115 caused the immune system to break its \"tolerance\" of the cancer cells, which means that the immune system started to attack the cancer cells even in the absence of the virus. This is a sign that the virus is working as a vaccine to protect against future tumors. In summary, R-LM113 and R-115 are safe and effective at treating cancer, and cause the immune system to be more active against cancer cells even after the primary tumor is gone.

We found that Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells are readily susceptible to HIV, while ALVAC vector-specific CD4 T cells are substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. This lower susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells is associated with the reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Phenotypic analysis showed that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells produce higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-1β), but little IL-17.

In contrast, unbiased random X inactivation (RXI) equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each female tissue. The evolutionary forces that account for the diversity of X inactivation strategies are not yet clear. Our study used a theoretical population genetic analysis to explore how conditions such as dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection might influence the evolution of X inactivation strategies. The results suggest that a combination of allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes. Random X inactivation is favored over complete PXI as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive. The criteria for random X inactivation evolution are more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic (i.e., alleles deleterious to females are beneficial to males) relative to variation that is deleterious to both sexes. Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness.

They found that animals infected with the vaccine strain survived productive infection with little evidence of disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues. In contrast, mice infected with ZH501 became very sick, and their immune system responded strongly to the infection, which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue damage. \\nThe researchers found that lymphopenia ( loss of white blood cells called lymphocytes ) and platelet depletion ( loss of platelets in the blood ) were indicators of disease onset, and that increases in a particular protein called G-CSF were associated with lymphocyte recovery.

To better understand RVFV pathogenesis and immune response, researchers infected C57BL/6 mice with either a wild-type strain or a vaccine strain. The animals infected with the vaccine strain had little to no evidence of clinical disease or cytokine response. On the other hand, animals infected with the wild-type strain had severe disease characterized by lymphocyte and platelet depletion, a strong cytokine response, high virus titers, and tissue pathology. Lymphocyte and platelet depletion were indicative of disease onset and were correlated with increases in G-CSF production, suggesting that G-CSF may be a potential treatment.

Additionally, CCL20 activates a protein called p65 nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) that helps BCSCs survive. The study also found that NF-κB activates the production of CCL20, creating a \"positive feedback loop\" that sustains the resistance of BCSCs to chemotherapy.

TNBC is highly malignant and susceptible to developing drug resistance during chemotherapy . However , the reasons for resistance have not been well explained .

These proteins have different roles in the parasite's lifecycle, such as co-opting crucial host cell functions and proteins, such as the cell cycle, c-Myc and p38 MAP kinase.

However, the translocation process and its machinery are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport. We did this by screening Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export two proteins called GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus. Through this screening, we found that three new proteins called MYR1, MYR2, and MYR3 play a crucial role in the translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell. These proteins are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes.

However, this copying process can be interrupted by a complex of proteins called the origin recognition complex (ORC). Researchers have found that the HPV virus can use ORC to start the copying process, but once the copying has begun, ORC is no longer needed. The researchers then found that a protein called ORC2, which is part of the ORC complex, actually inhibits the virus's ability to copy itself. This is because ORC2 helps prevent the virus from using the cell's own machinery to make copies of its DNA. The researchers also found that when they lowered the amount of ORC2 in the cells, the virus was able to copy itself more easily. This suggests that the virus needs a certain amount of ORC2 in order to inhibit its own copying process.</td>\n",

First, the DNA is copied a few times upon infection. Next, during the cell cycle, the DNA is copied a few more times. Finally, when the cell differentiates (or matures), the DNA is copied a lot more. In this study, the authors found that HPV E2 binds to a protein called ORC2, which is a key player in starting the process of DNA replication. However, the authors did not find that ORC2 is important for the process of copying HPV DNA. In fact, the authors found that ORC2 actually suppresses the ability of E2 to start copying the DNA. This result is surprising because ORC2 is usually needed to start the process of copying DNA in cells. The authors also found that when the HPV E2 protein is overexpressed, it restricts the ability of ORC2 to start the process of copying DNA at known locations in the human genome. This result suggests that HPV E2 may be interfering with the process of copying DNA at these locations.

PV genome replication program exhibits three stages: initial amplification from a single genome upon infection to a few copies per cell , a cell cycle linked maintenance phase , and a differentiation dependent late stage where the genome is amplified to thousands of copies . Involvement of ORC or other pre-replication complex ( pre-RC ) factors has not been described . We report that human PV ( HPV ) and bovine PV ( BPV-1 ) E2 proteins bind to ORC2 , however , ORC2 was not detected at the viral origin . Depletion of ORC2 enhanced PV replication in a transient replication model and in keratinocytes stably maintaining viral episomes , while there was no effect on copy number in a cell line with integrated HPV genomes . Consistent with this , occupancy of E1 and E2 at the viral origin increased following ORC2 silencing . These data imply that ORC2 is not necessary for activation of the PV origin by E1 and E2 but instead suppresses E2 replicative function . Furthermore , we observed that over-expression of HPV E2 decreased ORC2 occupation at two known mammalian origins of replication , suggesting that E2 restricts pre-ORC assembly that could otherwise compete for host replication complexes necessary for viral genome amplification . We infer that the ORC2 complex with E2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral replication program and that elevated levels of E2 that occur during the differentiation dependent amplification stage subvert ORC loading and hence DNA synthesis at cellular origins .</td>\n",

Unfortunately , life-saving vaccines and biologicals for rabies are hard to get and expensive, especially for the poorest people who are at the greatest risk of getting rabies . It is important to find ways to make it easier for people who have been exposed to rabies to get the vaccination they need, and to do it at a lower cost. In this study , researchers found that giving people the rabies vaccine through their skin ( intradermal delivery ) instead of through a muscle ( intramuscular delivery ) is just as effective but uses a lot less vaccine. This means that it is possible to treat more people with the same amount of vaccine, which could help solve problems with vaccine shortages. In addition , this study shows that using intradermal delivery is much cheaper than intramuscular delivery. The researchers suggest ways that governments and other organizations can pay for the vaccines so that more people can get them. This would make it easier for people to get the treatment they need to prevent rabies, and it would also be cheaper for organizations to provide this treatment. Overall, this study shows that it is important to use intradermal delivery of PEP to make it more accessible and affordable for people who have been exposed to rabies, and that this could lead to a reduction in human deaths from rabies.</td>\n",

But for communities most at risk of exposure to rabies ( in resource poor countries where domestic dog rabies is still common ) , post-exposure vaccines are often not affordable and are only available in limited quantities . Several safe and effective regimens for delivery of these vaccines are recommended by WHO , but these are inconsistently implemented and there are no clear recommendations as to which is the best regimen for specific settings . We developed a framework for comparing the cost-effectiveness of different vaccination regimens , including existing approved regimens and new candidates subject to approval , in terms of costs per death averted . We demonstrate that post-exposure vaccination is an extremely cost-effective public health intervention and that changing delivery from intramuscular to intradermal vaccination has considerable benefits . Large savings in the volume of vaccine required to treat the same number of patients could potentially both mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce delays in delivery , enabling wider vaccine distribution , and thus improving the accessibility and affordability of these life-saving vaccines . We also present financing mechanisms that could help subsidize the cost for those most in need , and even support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs , without compromising existing healthcare budgets .</td>\n",

Unfortunately , life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals are often neither accessible nor affordable , particularly to the poorest sectors of society who are most at risk and upon whom the largest burden of rabies falls . Increasing accessibility , reducing costs and preventing delays in delivery of PEP should therefore be prioritized . We analyzed different PEP vaccination regimens and evaluated their relative costs and benefits to bite victims and healthcare providers . We found PEP vaccination to be an extremely cost-effective intervention ( from $200 to less than $60/death averted ) . Switching from intramuscular ( IM ) administration of PEP to equally efficacious intradermal ( ID ) regimens was shown to result in significant savings in the volume of vaccine required to treat the same number of patients , which could mitigate vaccine shortages , and would dramatically reduce the costs of implementing PEP . We present financing mechanisms that would make PEP more affordable and accessible , could help subsidize the cost for those most in need , and could even support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs .

The authors developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice. \\nWhen pDC were depleted prior to HIV-1 infection, the induction of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished during acute HIV-1 infection with either a highly pathogenic CCR5/CXCR4-dual tropic HIV-1 or a standard CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate. Consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. Interestingly, the cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was severely reduced in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1 induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs, but not the blood, was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication. The increased cell number in lymphoid organs was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells. \\nThe authors conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis.

During acute HIV-1 infection, they found that the induction of type I interferons (IFN-I) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished in pDC-depleted mice. This was consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, as HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1-induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs, but not the blood, was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication. This was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells. The scientists conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis. These findings suggest that pDC depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retroviral treatment.</td>\n",

To define the role of pDC in HIV-1 infection and immunopathogenesis in vivo , we developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically and efficiently depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice . We discover that pDC are the critical IFN-I producer cells in response to acute HIV-1 infection , because depletion of pDC completely abolished induction of IFN-I or ISG by HIV-1 infection , correlated with elevated level of HIV-1 replication . When pDC were depleted during chronic HIV-1 infection in humanized mice , pDC were still the major IFN-I producing cells in vivo , which contributed to HIV-1 suppression . Despite of higher level of viral replication in pDC-depleted mice , we found that HIV-induced depletion of human T cells and leukocytes was significantly reduced in lymphoid organs , correlated with reduced cell death induction by HIV-1 infection . Our findings demonstrate that pDC play two opposing roles in HIV-1 pathogenesis: they produce IFN-I to suppress HIV-1 replication and induce death of human immune cells to contribute to HIV-induced T cell depletion and immunopathogenesis .</td>\n",

However, it is not yet known how Nrf2 affects human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In this study, we found that the natural compound sulforaphane (SFN), which is produced in cruciferous vegetables after mechanical damage and activates Nrf2, effectively blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells. SFN also blocks HIV infection in PMA-differentiated promonocytic cell lines, but not in other cell lines tested. We found that the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment are mediated through Nrf2, as Nrf2 depletion boosted HIV infectivity and reduced the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment. Interestingly, we also found that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection at the entry stage before formation of 2-LTR circles, without upregulating the type I interferon-induced cellular anti-viral proteins SAMHD1 and MX2. This highlights a novel way to trigger Nrf2 action and block HIV infection.</td>\n",

A substance called sulforaphane ( SFN ), found in cruciferous vegetables after injury, activates Nrf2 to reprogram gene expression. We have found that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. This blockade of infection is due to Nrf2 activation, which is mobilized by SFN. We also found that SFN treatment blocks HIV infection after entry but before 2-LTR circles are formed, and that neither SAMHD1 nor MX2 are upregulated.

An increasing body of work is showing that some viruses activate and benefit from Nrf2 . In this work we tested the impact of Nrf2 on HIV . We used SFN , abundant in cruciferous vegetables and often used as a dietary supplement , to activate Nrf2 . Here we show , for the first time , that in immune cells isolated from donor blood , SFN halts HIV infection in macrophages , but not in T cells . We further show that upon SFN treatment the virus is blocked after it has transcribed its RNA-encoded genome into DNA , but before this genetic material is inserted into host chromosomes . Importantly this block is indeed dependent on Nrf2 . Interestingly , Nrf2 does not activate recognized anti-viral genes . Thus , unlike viruses recently found to benefit from Nrf2 activation , HIV can be blocked by its activation .

Geohelminth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms or low body mass index. A hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference (adjusted mean decrease 0.7 cm, 95% CI 0.3-1.2 cm) and hookworm infections with an egg count of ≥1000/gram feces (11 women) were associated with lower hemoglobin (adjusted mean decrease 1.5 g/dl, 95% CI 0.3-2.7).

The most common geohelminths found in the study were Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura. Although these infections were common, the researchers did not find any major negative effects on the pregnant women, such as clinical symptoms or weight loss. However, hookworm infections were associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference and lower hemoglobin levels in women with high egg counts. This suggests that hookworm infections may have some negative effects on the health of pregnant women, especially when the infection is severe. The researchers also found that women with Ascaris lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasites in their blood than women without Ascaris lumbricoides. This suggests that geohelminth infections may have some protective effects against malaria parasites. Overall, the study highlights the importance of addressing geohelminth infections in pregnant women in areas with poor water supply and sanitation.</td>\n",

To better understand the host genetic determinants that may be influencing these different outcomes, a study was conducted on individuals from HAT active foci in Guinea. The study collected samples from 425 people, including 232 HAT cases, 79 subjects with long-lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls. The researchers analyzed 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes, and after quality control, they found that the IL6 rs1818879 allele A was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease. The MIF rs36086171 allele G seemed to be associated with an increased risk, but this association did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. Similarly, the MIF rs12483859 C allele was found to be associated with latent infections.

These differences can be due to changes in gene regulation. It is important to understand how these changes occur, and how they are related to gene expression. Most research on this topic has focused on the effects of genetic changes on the regions of DNA that control gene expression. However, less is known about the role of RNA processing in regulating gene expression. This is because it is difficult to identify functional elements in the regions of DNA that are not translated into proteins. In this study, researchers conducted an analysis of the ends of RNA molecules in lymphoblastoid cells from different human individuals. They found that the positions of these ends were not randomly located, but rather preferred to be close to certain regions of DNA that control gene expression. The usage of different RNA length forms and motifs in these regions varied across different individuals, and genetic changes in these regions were significant predictors of the expression levels of the genes. Independent experiments confirmed that genetic changes in these regions affected the expression levels of the genes. The researchers also looked at the gene IRF5, and how natural genetic variations in RNA processing affected the regulation of this gene in response to antigen stimulation. The researchers found that two mechanisms are at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of different 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate. The researchers suggest that the strategy of combining observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will be a useful tool in efforts to understand the human genome.   \n",

However, little is known about how this vaccine works. In this study, researchers used advanced technology to analyze the immune response of vaccinated animals. They found that the initial response was directed against regions of the virus that vary more widely, but as the virus evolved to escape the immune response, the response became more focused on regions of the virus that are highly conserved. This broadened the immune response to include more diverse regions of the virus, which is associated with better protection. These findings make SIVΔnef a useful model for researchers to study how vaccines can be designed to be more effective.   \n",

The immune system protects against these infections, but we do not know how to induce immunity against them. We used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) to study this. We found that the immune response is regulated by a molecule called interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R). IL-1R is important for controlling fungal growth at the beginning of the infection. This happens because IL-1R affects neutrophils in two ways: it helps neutrophils reach the site of the infection and it helps new neutrophils be made in the bone marrow. IL-1R-deficient mice had problems controlling fungal growth because they did not produce enough of a molecule called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and they did not make enough of a molecule called chemokines. G-CSF is made by endothelial cells, which are a type of cell found in the mouth. Chemokines are made by keratinocytes, which are another type of cell found in the mouth. Keratinocytes release IL-1α, which is important for G-CSF production by endothelial cells. We confirmed these findings in vitro using a new type of mouse cell called a keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. Together, these data show that IL-1R is important for regulating the immune response to fungal infections in the mouth and for protecting the host from these infections.   \n",

This disease is caused by a parasite and can lead to disabilities and other serious health problems. Between 2000 and 2007, the GPELF gave more than 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million people, which were given through an annual mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs (albendazole, ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine) to everyone at risk. \\nIt is important to know how much money this program saves by preventing lymphatic filariasis. To do this, researchers looked at how many people got treatments and how many people got better as a result of these treatments. They also looked at the cost of treating lymphatic filariasis, the cost of people not being able to work because of the disease, and the cost of treating people who were sick. They found that over 20 years, the program will save about $21.8 billion by treating about 31.4 million people. About $2.3 billion of this money comes from people who will never get lymphatic filariasis because they were born in areas where the disease is now gone. Another $19.5 billion comes from people who already have the disease, but will not get any worse because of the program. This program will also save health systems about $2.2 billion because people will not need to be treated as much anymore. \\nIn conclusion, treating lymphatic filariasis with the GPELF program saves a lot of money. This is because the cost of the program is low, due in part to the donation of drugs from the pharmaceutical industry. The economic return on this program is very high, which means that it is a great investment in public health.   \n",

Research has shown that certain genetic mutations that cause GD can also increase the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, researchers created a type of fish called medaka that lacked a protein called Gaucher disease-related protein (GCase), which is usually responsible for breaking down GC. Surprisingly, these GCase-deficient fish lived for several months, allowing researchers to study the development of GD-like symptoms in more detail. The fish showed many of the same symptoms as people with neuronopathic GD, including the buildup of Gaucher-like cells in the brain, progressive nerve cell loss, and microglia (a type of brain cell). These symptoms were caused by lysosomal problems in nerve cells and the accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein in swollen nerve cells. However, when researchers tried to remove alpha-synuclein from the fish, this did not improve their symptoms or extend their lifespan. This study provides new insights into the development of GD-like symptoms and the role of alpha-synuclein in GD.   \n",

This type of infection is usually mild, but it can sometimes be severe. When L. monocytogenes infects a person, their immune system responds by producing cells called T cells. However, if L. monocytogenes is contained in a specific part of the cell called a phagosome, the immune system's response is suppressed. This means that the body is not able to produce as many T cells as it should. In addition, the body is also not able to produce a certain type of molecule called IL-10, which is important for fighting infections. By blocking the IL-10 receptor or preventing the body from producing MyD88, the immune system's response can be restored. These findings show that the location of bacteria within the cell can affect the immune system's ability to fight off infections.   \n",

POAG is a complex disease caused by multiple genes, and research has identified a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 gene. In this study, researchers sequenced the SIX6 gene in 262 POAG patients and 256 healthy individuals and found six nonsynonymous coding variants. Five of these variants were found primarily in POAG patients, and one was found only in healthy individuals. These variants were then tested in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation assay. The results showed that five of the six variants were hypomorphic or null, meaning they had less or no protein-making ability, while the remaining variant was benign. One of the variants in the SIX6 enhancer increased SIX6 gene expression and disrupted its regulation. In addition, the study identified a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent on SIX6 genotype: patients homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the non-risk allele. Based on these results, the researchers hypothesize that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells, thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss.   \n",

This type of bacteria has tiny “flagella” that help it swim in your intestines. Scientists have found a switch that controls when these flagella are turned on or off. The switch is located near the part of the bacteria that makes the toxins that cause diarrhea. When the switch is turned on, the flagella and toxin genes are turned on too, and the bacteria make both flagella and toxins. When the switch is turned off, the flagella and toxin genes are turned off too, and the bacteria cannot move or make toxins. This switch can change from on to off or from off to on during the bacteria's growth, depending on what it senses in the environment. Scientists have also found that a protein called RecV is responsible for changing the switch from on to off or off to on. It is not yet known how the switch changes from on to off or off to on, but scientists are working on finding out.   \n",

This process involves two cells, called the forespore and the mother cell. In a model organism called Bacillus subtilis, the development of the forespore and the mother cell is controlled by different types of RNA polymerase sigma subunits. These sigma subunits are called σF, σE, σG, and σK. σF is involved in the early stages of development and is replaced by σG at later stages. σE is replaced by σK. The activation of the sigma factors happens in a specific order and requires the presence of the previous factor. This process involves communication between the forespore and the mother cell. We wanted to study the function and regulation of these sigma factors in an intestinal pathogen called Clostridium difficile. Using a fluorescence reporter to track gene expression in single cells, we found that the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved in C. difficile, but there are some differences in how these factors work. For example, the activity of σE is partially independent of σF, and σG activity does not depend on σE. We also found that σK activity does not require σG. These results suggest that the endosporulation pathway is not as tightly controlled in C. difficile as it is in B. subtilis. However, our results also support the idea that the top-level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution, with the sigma factors being the key regulators of the pathway.   \n",

This signal can come from another protein or molecule and causes a change in the way the allosteric protein interacts with other molecules or cells. In some allosteric multisite proteins, the signal can come from multiple places at the same time, but these changes still cause the same overall effect. \\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to model how these allosteric multisite proteins respond to signals. We use a single variable, called an auxiliary variable, to describe how the protein responds to the signal. This makes it easier to understand and analyze how the protein works. We also show that when the signal from each site of the protein is concerted and redundant, it makes the protein more sensitive to the signal. \\n\\nTo show how this framework can be used, we use the example of a checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast. This pathway measures the size of the bud or growth of the yeast cell. It works by detecting a signal from a protein called Bud15 and another protein called Tec1, which are both involved in the growth of the bud. The pathway also includes an all-or-none response, which means that once the signal reaches a certain threshold, the response happens all at once. We show that this pathway can work as a hysteretic switch, which means that once the signal reaches the threshold, the response will happen even if the signal decreases.   \n",

This allows them to work together and do things that they can't do alone. These groups of bacteria can be helpful or harmful. QS is like a \"switch\" that turns on and off depending on the number of bacteria around. The way this \"switch\" works is not completely clear, but scientists are trying to understand it. They are doing this by using experiments and math to figure out how different parts of the system work together and affect each other. They found that some parts of the system work together in a way that is different from what was thought before. They also found that one part of the system is especially important and plays a key role in turning the \"switch\" on and off. This finding will help scientists understand how QS works and how it can be used to coordinate the actions of large groups of bacteria.   \n",

These worms can make a person more likely to get malaria. However, it is not completely clear how much this happens or if it happens more in certain groups of people. In this study, researchers looked at how having worms called Schistosoma haematobium and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) like Trichuris trichiura and hookworms might affect the risk of getting malaria. The study was done in school-aged children living in rural areas in Gabon. Researchers used different tests to see if the children had malaria parasites, S. haematobium eggs, and STH eggs. The children were tested for malaria at the beginning of the study and then the researchers tracked who got malaria over time and how long it took for each person to get it. The results showed that having S. haematobium and STH increased the risk of getting malaria, but having S. haematobium and STH together made the risk even higher. The study also found that children who got malaria were younger if they had S. haematobium than the children who did not get malaria. Overall, the study suggests that having both S. haematobium and STH together makes children more likely to get malaria.   \n",

To understand how inflammation affects responses of immune cells called CD8+ T cells to Leishmania, scientists used mice and compared how the response was different if the mice had a protein called IRF-5 or not. They found that having IRF-5 turned on the expression of genes that made certain proteins, including IL-6 and TNF, that help fight the infection. They then wanted to see how this IRF-5-mediated inflammation affected CD8+ T cell responses. They found that having IRF-5 turned on limited the expansion of CD8+ T cells and induced a protein called HIF-1α in a type of immune cell called dendritic cells. When the scientists used mice that lacked HIF-1α in these dendritic cells, they found that CD8+ T cells expanded more, the IL-12 expression by these dendritic cells increased, and these mice had a lower splenic parasite burden. This suggests that induction of HIF-1α by Leishmania may be a way for these parasites to evade the immune response and establish persistent infections.   \n",

In order to help doctors identify patients who are at higher risk of dying from this disease, researchers have reviewed studies from Latin America to find potential predictors of poor outcomes and death. They looked at different factors, including age, jaundice (yellowing of the skin), thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), hemorrhage (bleeding), HIV coinfection (having HIV and leishmaniasis at the same time), diarrhea (loose stools), age under 5 or over 40-50 years, severe neutropenia (low white blood cell count), dyspnoea (difficulty breathing), edema (swelling), and low hemoglobin concentration (low levels of red blood cells). They found that these factors were strong predictors of poor outcomes, and that further research should focus on validating these findings in other studies.   \n",
       "14  In Algeria, the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis has been and continues to be based on antimony-containing drugs. However, it is possible that high drug selective pressure can favor the emergence of chemoresistant parasites. While treatment failure is frequently reported during antimonial therapy of both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, antimonial resistance has never been thoroughly investigated in Algeria. Determining the level of antimonial susceptibility of Leishmania transmitted in Algeria is of great importance for the development of public health policies. Within the framework of the knowledge about the epidemiology of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis amassed during the last 30 years, researchers sampled Leishmania isolates to determine their susceptibility to antimony. They analyzed a total of 106 isolates, including 88 isolates collected between 1976 and 2013 from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines in Algeria, where leishmaniasis is endemic, and 18 collected from dogs in France. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of potassium antimony tartrate (the trivalent form of antimony, Sb (III)) and sodium stibogluconate (the pentavalent form of antimony, Sb (V)) were determined in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively. The researchers were able to determine an epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) that allowed them to differentiate between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis that were susceptible (S+) or insusceptible (S-) to the trivalent form of antimony. The computed IC50 cutoff values were 23.83 μg/mL and 15.91 μg/mL for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. The researchers report a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis isolates during the 30-year period. In contrast, an increase in the frequency of S- phenotypes in isolates causing cutaneous leishmaniasis was observed during the same period. In their study, the emergence of S- phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of L. killicki (syn: L. tropica) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and that have emerged in Algeria during the last decade. The researchers' results provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria. They highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains.   \n",

Sometimes, being infected with a foodborne pathogen can cause acute gastroenteritis, which increases the risk of developing CD later on. However, the relationship between the post-infectious period and the development of CD is not fully understood. To study this, two new models were developed using mice. The mice were first colonized with a bacterial pathobiont called adherent-invasive E. coli (AIEC), which is linked to CD. Then, the mice were infected with either Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium. After the pathogen had been cleared, the researchers found that the AIEC pathobiont had become more active and had caused more immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution. This was due to the fact that AIEC is resistant to host defense peptides and causes a severe inflammatory response. The researchers think that people who have AIEC in their bodies at the time they are infected with a foodborne pathogen may have a higher risk of developing CD. Additionally, the researchers found that AIEC could be used as a target for therapeutic interventions, which could help people who have been infected with a foodborne pathogen from developing CD.   \n",

The female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells, the egg cell and the central cell, which are surrounded by five accessory cells. Both gametic and accessory cells play important roles in fertilization, but the mechanisms that determine the formation of gametic and accessory cell fates are unknown. In a search for factors that influence the fate of egg cells, we identified the lachesis (lis) mutant, which produces extra egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells acquire the characteristics of gametic cells, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that stops accessory cells from taking on gametic cell characteristics. The pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. LIS is similar to the yeast splicing factor PRP4, indicating that components of the spliceosome, a machine that helps with splicing, are also involved in cell fate decisions.   \n",

However, understanding the reasons behind people's shoe usage can help in developing effective strategies to ensure consistent use of shoes. Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, a research group analyzed the factors influencing shoe use among children in a rural highland community in Ethiopia. Through focus groups, interviews and case studies, the researchers found that while people understood the benefits of wearing shoes, there were numerous practical and social obstacles preventing them from doing so. For example, many people could not afford multiple pairs of shoes, so they only wore shoes for special occasions or for older children. Other barriers included limited access to shoes that fit properly and concerns about social stigma. Using well-known models of health behavior, the researchers identified several practical and social obstacles that could be addressed through intervention to increase shoe use among children in the community.   \n",

However, it is unclear how the Us9 protein accomplishes this. It has been found that the viral glycoproteins gB, gC, gD, and gE are all associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes, and are directed into axons in a Us9-dependent manner. In this study, it was found that Us9 is also associated with lipid rafts, and that this association is necessary for Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins. To investigate this further, non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that becomes sympathetic neuron-like in the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF), were used. In these cells, Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), which are lipid rafts. Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. It was concluded that the association of Us9 with lipid rafts is critical for efficient targeting of viral structural proteins to axons, which in turn leads to directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system.   \n",

This is called \"nongenetic heterogeneity\" and it can affect how well cells grow or respond to treatment, such as drugs or heat. The researchers studied this phenomenon in yeast cells using genetic and chemical changes, as well as single-cell measurements of how well each cell grows and how it responds to stress. They found that the amount of a molecule called cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its effects on specific proteins are important for this nongenetic heterogeneity. They also discovered that this type of heterogeneity is not always linked to slower growth rates and increased resistance to stress. This suggests that cells may be able to be treated more effectively by making them more uniform in their characteristics.   \n",

In December 2013, a new strain of CHIKV, called the Asian Lineage, spread from Asia to the Americas. This spread caused a major outbreak in the Caribbean. To understand how CHIKV may have evolved during this outbreak, researchers studied the genetic diversity of the virus in infected individuals. They used a technique called deep sequencing, which allows researchers to look at the genetic makeup of the virus in great detail. The researchers analyzed virus samples from two islands in the Caribbean: Guadeloupe and Martinique. They found that the genetic diversity of the virus had changed since it had spread from Asia to the Americas. They also discovered a new structure in the virus's genetic material that helped it to replicate better in insect cells. Overall, these studies highlight the importance of monitoring the genetic diversity of viruses over time, especially during outbreaks, to understand how they may evolve.   \n",

The new gene, called UBTOR, was found to have an impact on cell growth and a related signaling pathway called mTOR. When UBTOR levels were reduced in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells, the neurite outgrowth was promoted. In addition, UBTOR depletion activated mTOR signaling and promoted cell growth, while UBTOR overexpression suppressed colony formation in cancer cell lines. Studies in cultured cells and zebrafish models showed that UBTOR inhibited mTOR signaling by stabilizing the mTOR complex component DEPTOR. The results of gene disruption in zebrafish models showed that UBTOR depletion led to higher mTOR activity and aggravated HRAS (G12V)-induced neoplasia. Furthermore, UBTOR depletion promoted tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model. Overall, the findings suggest that UBTOR plays a significant role in regulating cell growth and neoplasia through the mTOR signaling pathway.   \n",

One of these protozoan parasites is Trypanosoma brucei, which is responsible for a debilitating and often fatal disease called human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. Scientists have a difficult time understanding the biology and pathogenesis of Trypanosoma brucei because many of its proteins have unknown functions. Protein-protein interactions can help researchers understand the function of proteins, but there is currently no global map of these interactions for Trypanosoma brucei. To address this problem, researchers used biochemical fractionation to systematically identify co-complex interactions between more than 3354 protein groups in the procyclic life stage of Trypanosoma brucei. They used a rigorous methodology to identify 128 high-confidence complexes, including 716 protein groups that lacked experimental annotation. These complexes correlate well with known pathways and proteins that are co-expressed across the Trypanosoma brucei life cycle. The researchers also validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery, including a candidate protein involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of Trypanosoma brucei.

Lymph nodes are one of the most common sites of extrapulmonary TB infection, and the lymph nodes in the chest are often affected in humans. Scientists have studied the bacterial dynamics and the effects of TB infection on the structure and function of chest lymph nodes in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques. They used PET-CT scans, bacterial load analysis, lymph node structure, and immune function tests. The PET-CT scans showed a correlation between the level of infection and the presence of live bacteria in the lymph nodes at autopsy. They also found that different lymph nodes have different trajectories (increasing, maintaining, or decreasing in PET activity over time). They also found that rhesus macaques are more susceptible to TB infection compared to cynomolgus macaques, and this is due to more extensive lymph node pathology. The study also found that although the level of TB infection was the same in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, cynomolgus macaques were able to control TB at later time points post-infection while rhesus macaques could not. The scientists also discovered that lymph nodes are not only important sites for antigen presentation and immune activation during infection, but they also serve as important sites for persistence of significant numbers of TB bacilli.   \n",

This research has discovered 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections and named six new species in the Nematocida genus. These microsporidian infections are highly diverse and widespread in wild Caenorhabditis elegans worms. The research has also identified two subclades of microsporidians that are genetically distinct from Nematocida, which belong to the clade of microsporidians that includes human pathogens. The microsporidians found in this study replicate in different parts of their host worms and use different mechanisms to exit their host cells. Additionally, the research found that some microsporidians can infect certain species of nematode worms but not others. The research provides a valuable resource to study the coevolution of host and parasite.   \n",

Research shows that homodimers (dimers made up of the same receptor) and heterodimers (dimers made up of different receptors) of these receptors affect their function. The study used molecular dynamics simulations to determine the homodimer and heterodimer configurations of these receptors at an atomic level of detail. The researchers found that homodimers of the closely related CC chemokine receptors were similar, but differed significantly from CC receptors and CXCR4. Cholesterol was found to affect the homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Heterodimers of CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2 were found to have distinct dimerization patterns. Additionally, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 showed an increased cholesterol sensitivity compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive structural overview of the complex interactions between chemokine receptors and how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs.   \n",

A typical form can be characterized by prolonged fever, swollen liver and spleen, and weight loss. However, a subclinical form has also been identified, which can present with either one or two of these symptoms missing, along with other signs such as enlarged lymph nodes and anemia. In this report, the authors describe a new form of leishmaniasis they refer to as \"atypical.\" This form is characterized by a normal appearing immune system, but with macrophages that are filled with Leishmania parasites. This atypical form can present with a wide range of symptoms, including difficulty fighting off infections. This finding suggests that leishmaniasis may present with a much wider spectrum of symptoms than previously thought and is likely much more common than currently diagnosed. The authors also note that they found several adults with this atypical form, indicating that this disease is not limited to children as previously thought. The authors recommend considering the diagnosis of atypical leishmaniasis in anyone with unexplained immune suppression.   \n",

However, it is difficult to determine the clinical significance of these genetic variations. Researchers have found that changes to conserved amino acids are a good indicator of variants with potential clinical significance. In this study, we examined the potential of genetic variants that occur at the same position in paralogous human proteins (similar proteins that perform similar functions) as a means of identifying polymorphisms with clinical significance. Our results show that variants in paralogous proteins tend to occur at the same location. Additionally, if one member of a variant pair is known to cause disease, the other member is also likely to cause disease. This information can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, improve procedures for identifying high-priority polymorphisms, and provide a list of candidates for further investigation in terms of diagnostics and treatments.   \n",

This parasite can change in response to different environments within the human body, but it is not clear how it responds to the environment in severe malaria. In this study, researchers used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to study the genes that are expressed in 19 parasites that caused severe malaria and 25 parasites that caused uncomplicated malaria. They found that the parasites that caused severe malaria had lower levels of a protein called PfEMP1 on their surface, and they also had lower levels of histones, which are proteins that help control gene expression. They also found that the parasites that caused severe malaria had lower levels of genes involved in energy production. These findings will help researchers understand how the parasite changes in response to different environments within the human body and could be used to help develop new treatments for severe malaria.   \n",

To test this, researchers used AAV vector to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to rhesus monkeys. Despite the delivery of antibodies, host antibody responses were observed in 9 out of 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration of antibody that could be achieved. However, 6 monkeys that received AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb showed clear protective effects despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge virus. These protective effects included lowering of viral load at peak height and set point, as well as delay in the time to peak viral load from the time of the infectious virus exposure. All of these effects were statistically significant. Additionally, the monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb completely resisted six successive SIVmac239 i . v . challenges. The researchers' results demonstrate the continued promise of this approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in people, but the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized.   \n",

This idea is often used to study how proteins move. Researchers have looked at two important protein motors, myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, and used computer simulations to see how they move. They found that this assumption is not always right, especially for kinesin KIF1A, where the normal mode description completely fails to explain how the protein moves. This suggests that scientists may need to rethink some of their assumptions about how proteins move.   \n",

However, the molecular mechanisms and functional relevance of CIE are not well understood. In this study, we have found that two specific proteins, Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, are independent negative regulators of the CIE pathway. This means that these proteins inhibit the process of CIE without the formation of caveolae. The proteins Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 have been shown to inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway, which is a type of CIE, without the formation of caveolae. This process is independent of caveolin-1, which is another important component of caveolae. We have also found that caveolin-1 and cavin-1/cavin-3 inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon overexpression. Furthermore, the CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking caveolin-1 and Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3. We have also found that Cavin-1 can regulate the activity of a key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway, Cdc42. This work provides new insights into the regulation of noncaveolar clathrin-independent endocytosis by specific caveolar proteins, illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways.

To transmit a signaling response, most of these systems use a sensory histidine kinase to phosphorylate a Receiver (REC) domain on a specific aspartate (Asp) residue. However, it is unclear how many REC domains lack this phosphorylatable Asp residue, what their functions are, and how they are regulated in the absence of the phosphorylatable Asp residue. In this study, we collected all REC domains that lack a phosphorylatable Asp residue and renamed them Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains. We found that ALRs are surprisingly common and are more likely to be attached to rare effector outputs. By analyzing available ALR atomic structures, combined with genetic and biochemical data, we suggest that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or to accommodate input signals other than phosphorylation of the aspartate residue, while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface.   \n",

In order to make these viruses selective for cancer cells, scientists often remove certain genes that allow the virus to fight against the host's immune response. As a result, these viruses are frequently weakened or extremely weakened. We have developed a new type of oncolytic virus that is fully virulent in cancer cells but not in other cells in the body. These viruses have been retargeted to specifically attack cancer cells with high levels of a particular protein called HER2. In this study, we tested the safety and efficacy of these retargeted viruses in immunocompetent mice with cancer. We found that these viruses were safe and effective at shrinking the primary tumor. Additionally, the mice that survived the primary tumor were protected from a second tumor in the opposite side. Our results suggest that these viruses trigger an immune response that breaks the body's tolerance to the cancer cells and functions like a vaccine.   \n",

One such virus is adenovirus 5 (Ad5), which was used in a vaccine trial where excess HIV infections were observed. This highlights the need to understand the immune responses to vaccine vectors and the susceptibility of vector-specific T cells to HIV. In a recent study, we found that CD4 T cells induced by Ad5 vaccination (in the RV156A trial) are susceptible to HIV. In this study, we compared the HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by Ad5 and another virus, ALVAC, which was used in the RV144 trial in Thailand. We found that Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells are readily susceptible to HIV, while ALVAC vector-specific CD4 T cells are substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. This lower susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells is associated with the reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Phenotypic analysis showed that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells produce higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-1β), but little IL-17. Of interest, ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in PBMC, with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation and Ad5 inducing CD4 T-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALVAC- but not Ad5- induced CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.   \n",

In paternally inherited X inactivation (PXI), females are haploid for all maternally inherited alleles. In contrast, unbiased random X inactivation (RXI) equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each female tissue. The evolutionary forces that account for the diversity of X inactivation strategies are not yet clear. Our study used a theoretical population genetic analysis to explore how conditions such as dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection might influence the evolution of X inactivation strategies. The results suggest that a combination of allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes. Random X inactivation is favored over complete PXI as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive. The criteria for random X inactivation evolution are more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic (i.e., alleles deleterious to females are beneficial to males) relative to variation that is deleterious to both sexes. Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness. These results provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and lead to several useful predictions that could motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation.   \n",

However, only one virus, yellow fever virus, has been reported to be resistant to ZAP. In this study, we investigated the anti-viral potential of ZAP against three flaviviruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). We found that ZAP blocked JEV infection, but not DENV or ZIKV. We also found that ZAP inhibited JEV translation and targeted JEV RNA for degradation by the RNA exosome. The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity. We also mapped the specific region of JEV RNA that binds to ZAP and makes it sensitive to ZAP. In conclusion, we identified JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus. ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection.   \n",

It can cause severe diseases such as hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis ( swelling of the brain ). The virus is found naturally in parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but there is concern that it could spread to other regions, where it could have devastating effects on livestock populations as well as humans. \\nIn this study, the researchers looked at how mice responded to infection with either a wild-type strain of the virus ( ZH501 ) or a vaccine strain ( MP-12 ). They found that animals infected with the vaccine strain survived productive infection with little evidence of disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues. In contrast, mice infected with ZH501 became very sick, and their immune system responded strongly to the infection, which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue damage. \\nThe researchers found that lymphopenia ( loss of white blood cells called lymphocytes ) and platelet depletion ( loss of platelets in the blood ) were indicators of disease onset, and that increases in a particular protein called G-CSF were associated with lymphocyte recovery. They also found that the virus was hepatotropic ( attacks the liver ), causing liver necrosis ( death of cells in the liver ) and hepatitis ( inflammation of the liver ). However, they did not find strong evidence of a pro-inflammatory response ( an inflammatory response that causes tissue damage ) in the liver. Instead, they found a chemokine response, indicating the infiltration of immune cells such as neutrophils into the liver. They also found that in the brains of infected mice, there was a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response, but with little pathology ( damage to tissues ). These findings suggest that the disease caused by RVF in mice is associated with liver damage, but that the long-term course of the disease is neurologic ( affects the nervous system ), which is supported by observations of human disease and a different mouse model.   \n",

Taxanes are commonly used in chemotherapy regimens, but the mechanisms of resistance to taxanes are not well understood in triple-negative breast cancer. Our study found that the levels of a specific protein called CCL20 increased during taxane-containing chemotherapy in patients who had a nonpathologic complete response. Additionally, our results showed that CCL20 can promote the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells, which are a subtype of cancer cells that are highly resistant to chemotherapy. This increased resistance to taxanes can be reversed by blocking the CCL20 pathway, which suggests that CCL20 could be a useful predictive marker for taxane response in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of chemoresistance to develop more effective treatments for patients with breast cancer.   \n",

To survive and reproduce within its host, this parasite can manipulate the host's cell functions. The ability of Toxoplasma to infect and manipulate its host depends on its ability to transport proteins called \"GRA\" from unique organelles called dense granules into the host cell. These proteins have different roles in the parasite's lifecycle, such as co-opting crucial host cell functions and proteins, such as the cell cycle, c-Myc and p38 MAP kinase. Some of these GRA proteins are secreted into a space called the parasitophorous vacuole (PV), where the parasite replicates, and are then transported across the PV membrane into the host cell. However, the translocation process and its machinery are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport. We did this by screening Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export two proteins called GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus. Through this screening, we found that three new proteins called MYR1, MYR2, and MYR3 play a crucial role in the translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell. These proteins are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes. They are membrane-associated and MYR3, but not MYR2, stably associates with MYR1, whose N- and C-terminal fragments are disulfide-linked. We also found that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. Overall, these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell.   \n",

The virus has a special piece of DNA that it uses to copy itself. However, this copying process can be interrupted by a complex of proteins called the origin recognition complex (ORC). Researchers have found that the HPV virus can use ORC to start the copying process, but once the copying has begun, ORC is no longer needed. The researchers then found that a protein called ORC2, which is part of the ORC complex, actually inhibits the virus's ability to copy itself. This is because ORC2 helps prevent the virus from using the cell's own machinery to make copies of its DNA. The researchers also found that when they lowered the amount of ORC2 in the cells, the virus was able to copy itself more easily. This suggests that the virus needs a certain amount of ORC2 in order to inhibit its own copying process.   \n",

In Central Asia, it is a major health concern known as a \"neglected zoonotic disease.\" It mainly affects people with limited economic resources who often live in close proximity to livestock, such as in urban and peri-urban areas. The consumption of unpasteurized dairy products is common in this region, making it important to investigate whether these products contain Brucella. This study found that 10.3% of 564 cow milk samples from Dushanbe, Tajikistan contained Brucella DNA. Furthermore, 8.3% of seronegative cows also had Brucella DNA. This suggests that the current serological diagnostic tests used to detect Brucella may not be accurate. The study also found that the rpoB gene of two cows may have been infected with different species of Brucella, B. abortus and B. melitensis. This study highlights the need for more research to better understand the spread of Brucella among livestock in urban and peri-urban areas and to develop better diagnostic tests to detect it in these areas.   \n",

The pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici has eight extra chromosomes, but they are very unstable and are prone to errors during cell division. These extra chromosomes are also not very active, have a lot of repeating DNA sequences, and have a type of chemical tag called trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 or lysine 27 (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3). To understand how these extra chromosomes affect the stability of the genome, we created a double mutant that lacked the two genes that make these chemical tags. We then used several techniques to compare the changes in the genome structure, chromatin structure, and gene expression between the mutant and the wild type. Our results showed that in the absence of H3K9me3, many parts of the genome were reorganized, H3K27me3 was mostly relocated to the regions that originally had H3K9me3, new chromosomes were formed, and many transposable elements became active. On the other hand, the loss of H3K27me3 actually increased the stability of the extra chromosomes, even without major changes in gene activity. We conclude that the presence of H3K9me3 prevents H3K27me3 from forming in certain regions of the genome, which is important for maintaining genome stability.   \n",

However, life-saving vaccines and biologicals are often not accessible or affordable, particularly to the poorest sectors of society who are most at risk. To address this issue, we analyzed different PEP vaccination regimens and found that switching from intramuscular ( IM ) administration of PEP to equally efficacious intradermal ( ID ) regimens would result in significant savings in the volume of vaccine required to treat the same number of patients, which could mitigate vaccine shortages and dramatically reduce the costs of implementing PEP. We also present financing mechanisms that would make PEP more affordable and accessible, subsidizing the cost for those most in need, and even supporting new and existing rabies control and prevention programs. In conclusion, a universal switch to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths, as well as being economical for healthcare providers.   \n",

To get the lipids it needs, Toxoplasma attracts host lipid droplets (LD), which are the cell's own fat storage organelles. When the parasite replicates, the number of host LD increases, and the PV (parasitophorous vacuole, the space where the parasite grows) becomes surrounded by host LD. The parasite can take the lipids from the LD and use them for its own growth. If the host cells don't have enough LD or if they can't break down the fatty acids, the parasite's growth is reduced. The parasite can also take the LD and wrap it with a network of membranes (IVN) to process the lipids and release them. If the parasite can't form this network of membranes, it can't process the lipids as efficiently. The study shows that Toxoplasma relies on host LD for its growth and can scavenge neutral lipids from host LD.   \n",

Treatment for fasciolosis is limited to chemotherapy, which uses triclabendazole to target both juvenile and mature flukes. However, resistance to triclabendazole has been reported in many countries, so researchers are looking for new drugs to fight fasciolosis. They searched a library of flavonoid derivatives for molecules that could inhibit Fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases. Chalcones substituted with phenyl and naphtyl groups turned out to be good inhibitors of the enzymes cathepsin L, interacting with two putative binding sites within their active site cleft. One of the compounds, C34, tightly binds to juvenile-specific cathepsin L with an IC50 of 5.6 μM. C34 is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the Cys-His catalytic dyad and key S2 and S3 pocket residues. Interestingly, C34 also induces a reduction in the ability of the larvae to migrate through the gut wall and a loss of motility phenotype in the larvae, leading to their death in vitro. This is the first time that non-peptidic inhibitors of cathepsins have been identified in vitro, opening a new avenue for developing novel agents to control fasciolosis and other helminthic diseases.   \n",

These cells send this information to the inner part of the eye, called the retina, which processes it before sending it to the brain for further processing. A group of cells called bipolar cells are responsible for transmitting this information to the retina. These researchers used a special camera to watch the activity of these bipolar cells as they received different levels of light. They found that the size of the small sacs where these bipolar cells store their messages before sending them can affect how quickly they transmit this information. These smaller sacs also transmit information about faster changes in light intensity more effectively. By using mathematical models, the researchers were able to understand how these bipolar cells can transmit different types of information about light intensity at different speeds and with different levels of adaptation. This research provides important insights into how one type of cell in the human eye can transmit complex information about light intensity in different ways.   \n",

There are several methods available, but they each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Fluorescence microscopy (FM) and electron microscopy (EM) are two common methods for examining individual synapses. FM can analyze many synapses at once but it is difficult to distinguish between synaptic and non-synaptic signals. EM is the best way to identify a synapse, but it is slow and expensive. In order to develop and test new methods for analyzing synapses, we used datasets from conjugate array tomography (cAT). cAT provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM images of the same individual synapses. We created a new method for detecting synapses using fluorescence microscopy (muxFM) data alone. This method was able to accurately detect synapses and reproduce known features of cortical synapse distributions, even without the use of electron microscopy for cross-validation. This method has the potential to help us discover new types of synapses and their distribution within the brain. Additionally, this method could be useful for analyzing standard confocal and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy images, as electron microscopy cross-validation is not practical in those cases.   \n",

It is essential for key physiological processes such as nucleic acid metabolism, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, cell division, immune and nervous system functions, wound healing, and apoptosis. When zinc homeostasis is disrupted, it can lead to various human pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport occurs via two transporter families: ZnT and ZIP. However, the detailed mechanism of action of ZnT2, which is responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and zinc secretion into breast milk during lactation, is currently unknown. In this study, we have used computational modeling and functional zinc transport assays to show that ZnT2 is indeed a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. This means that ZnT2 transports zinc ions from acidic vesicles to the cytoplasm in exchange for proton ions. This proton-zinc antiport process is essential for the proper functioning of ZnT2 in lactation. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and its role in lactation.   \n",

To monitor the integrity of these forks, cells use a set of checkpoints that respond to DNA replication stress. 14-3-3 proteins are able to bind to phosphorylated proteins and play an unclear role under conditions of DNA replication stress. In a yeast cell model, a protein called Exo1 helps repair stalled forks. A new study has found that 14-3-3 proteins interact with Exo1 in both yeast and mammalian cells. When 14-3-3 proteins are missing, cells fail to respond properly to DNA replication stress, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects. The study also found that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression and stability, helping cells restart replication after stress. In conclusion, 14-3-3 proteins help repair and restart stalled replication forks, contributing to the maintenance of genome stability.   \n",

HIV-1 infection in a humanized mouse model leads to persistent HIV-1 infection and immunopathogenesis, including type I interferons (IFN-I) induction, immune-activation, and depletion of human leukocytes, including CD4 T cells. The authors developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice. \\nWhen pDC were depleted prior to HIV-1 infection, the induction of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished during acute HIV-1 infection with either a highly pathogenic CCR5/CXCR4-dual tropic HIV-1 or a standard CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate. Consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. Interestingly, the cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was severely reduced in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1 induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs, but not the blood, was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication. The increased cell number in lymphoid organs was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells. \\nThe authors conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis. These findings suggest that pDC-depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retrovirus treatment.   \n",

However, it is not yet known how Nrf2 affects human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In this study, we found that the natural compound sulforaphane (SFN), which is produced in cruciferous vegetables after mechanical damage and activates Nrf2, effectively blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells. SFN also blocks HIV infection in PMA-differentiated promonocytic cell lines, but not in other cell lines tested. We found that the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment are mediated through Nrf2, as Nrf2 depletion boosted HIV infectivity and reduced the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment. Interestingly, we also found that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection at the entry stage before formation of 2-LTR circles, without upregulating the type I interferon-induced cellular anti-viral proteins SAMHD1 and MX2. This highlights a novel way to trigger Nrf2 action and block HIV infection.   \n",

During a community-based cross-sectional study, pregnant women were interviewed and provided blood and stool samples. Hemoglobin levels were measured, blood slides examined for malaria, and geohelminth infections diagnosed using the concentration and Kato-Katz method. Among 390 participants, 76.2% were infected with at least one geohelminth, including 52.3% with Ascaris lumbricoides, 39.5% with hookworm, and 29% with Trichuris trichiura. Having at least one geohelminth infection was linked to using unprotected water sources (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.0) and not treating drinking water (AOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.1). Geohelminth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms or low body mass index. A hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference (adjusted mean decrease 0.7 cm, 95% CI 0.3-1.2 cm) and hookworm infections with an egg count of ≥1000/gram feces (11 women) were associated with lower hemoglobin (adjusted mean decrease 1.5 g/dl, 95% CI 0.3-2.7). Among gravidae 2 and 3, women with Ascaris lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.2-0.8) compared to women without Ascaris lumbricoides, unlike other gravidity groups. Geohelminth infections are common in this pregnant population, but there were few observed detrimental effects. Providing antihelminth treatment during antenatal clinic visits is recommended, but an evaluation of its impact on pregnancy, malaria, and birth outcomes is necessary in this area.   \n",

Mycolactone has been shown to have many different effects, such as causing cells to stop working properly, reducing pain, and changing the way the immune system works. In this study, researchers looked at how mycolactone affects the nervous cells that are involved in pain. These cells were taken from mice and rats and tested in a lab. The researchers found that mycolactone was able to reduce the amount of pain-causing chemicals that these cells made. However, mycolactone was not able to stop the cells from dying. This study provides more evidence that mycolactone can help reduce pain.   \n",

Over time, it was noticed that the way people responded to the disease varied significantly. Some progressed rapidly to the second stage of the disease, while others were able to regulate their parasite levels and experience long-lasting positive and specific serology without parasitology. To better understand the host genetic determinants that may be influencing these different outcomes, a study was conducted on individuals from HAT active foci in Guinea. The study collected samples from 425 people, including 232 HAT cases, 79 subjects with long-lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls. The researchers analyzed 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes, and after quality control, they found that the IL6 rs1818879 allele A was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease. The MIF rs36086171 allele G seemed to be associated with an increased risk, but this association did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. Similarly, the MIF rs12483859 C allele was found to be associated with latent infections. The researchers also confirmed that APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) is associated with a higher risk, and the APOL1 G1 polymorphism is associated with a lower risk of developing HAT. Overall, the study showed that host genes can significantly influence the outcome of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection in infected individuals.   \n",

The reason for this variation is not well understood, and a lot of work has been done to understand how genetic changes affect the amount of protein produced. This work has mostly focused on the regions of DNA that are upstream of the protein-making part of the gene, which are called regulatory regions. These regions are important for controlling the amount of protein that is made from the gene. However, not much is known about how another type of genetic variation, called RNA 3′-end variation, affects gene expression. RNA 3′-end variation refers to changes in the length of the tail-like structure at the end of the RNA molecule that is produced from a gene. The aim of this work was to study how RNA 3′-end variation affects gene expression. The authors used samples of blood cells from different people and compared the length of the tails of RNA molecules that were produced from different genes. They found that the length of the tails varied between people, and that some of these differences were due to changes in the DNA sequence that affect how long the tail is. The authors then studied how the variation in the length of the tails affected gene expression. They found that the length of the tails of RNA molecules can change the amount of protein that is made from the gene, and that some of these differences were due to changes in the DNA sequence. The authors then focused on a specific gene that plays an important role in the immune system, and found that natural variation in the length of the tails of RNA molecules affects how the gene responds to antigen stimulation. This variation is due to differences in the DNA sequence of the gene. The authors conclude that the strategy of comparing the lengths of RNA molecules from different people with the amounts of protein they produce can help us understand how genetic variation affects gene expression.   \n",

In this study, the authors use deep sequencing technology and CD8 T cell epitope mapping to analyze the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals. They found that, in the acute phase of infection, the CD8 T cell response is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes. However, as the infection progresses, widespread sequence evolution and viral escape occur. Despite this escape, the authors show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes, a phenomenon called anentropic specificity. This expansion of anentropic specificity and increased response depth correlate with protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. These findings render SIVΔnef as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design.   \n",

However, our understanding of how the immune system fights off these infections is incomplete. In this study , we used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) to investigate the role of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling in antifungal immunity. We found that IL-1R is critical for controlling fungal growth during the early stages of infection. IL-1R affects neutrophils, which are important cells of the immune system, in two ways. First, it helps recruit neutrophils to the site of infection. Second, it mobilizes newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. Without IL-1R, mice had defects in chemokine production at the site of infection and in secretion of a factor that helps generate new neutrophils in the bloodstream. We discovered that endothelial cells, which line blood vessels, are the primary source of this factor and that they are influenced by IL-1R. Our findings suggest a new link between IL-1 and the production of new neutrophils during fungal infections, and they highlight two complementary mechanisms that coordinate the neutrophil response to protect the host from disease.   \n",

Calculating the resulting economic benefits of this achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to understand the Programme's impact on the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits, the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with disease prevention were then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were used, including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization, International Monetary Fund, and International Labour Organization. An estimated $21.8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF. Of this total, over $2.3 billion is realized by protecting nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of being born into areas freed of LF transmission. Similarly, more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease, resulting in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately $19.5 billion. In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity save the health systems of endemic countries approximately $2.2 billion. MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits, and with favorable program implementation costs, it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high, making it an excellent investment in global health.   \n",

These mutations can cause Parkinson's disease too. To understand how GBA mutations cause Parkinson's disease, scientists created a new fish model of Gaucher disease. This model, called GBA-/-, has no activity of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase. Humans and mice with no glucocerebrosidase activity die at birth, but the GBA-/- fish lived for months. This allowed scientists to study the progression of the disease. The fish had symptoms that resembled Gaucher disease in humans, including infiltration of Gaucher cells into the brain, neuronal loss, and neuroinflammation. Unexpectedly, disrupting a protein called alpha-synuclein did not improve the disease symptoms. This study shows that the GBA-/- fish can be used as a new model of Gaucher disease, and that alpha-synuclein may not play a major role in the development of the disease.   \n",

It has a special ability to infect human immune cells and cause an immune response that can protect against future infections. In this study, we found that bacteria that are contained in a special compartment within immune cells ( called phagosomes ) can suppress the immune response to the bacteria in the same compartment as well as the bacteria in the rest of the cell . We also found that the bacteria in the phagosome make a protein that blocks the immune response by interfering with the way that the immune system produces a protein called interleukin-10 . When we blocked the interleukin-10 or used mice that don't have the interleukin-10 protein , the immune response was restored. These results show that the way that bacteria can interfere with the immune system can have important implications for human health.   \n",

It is caused by problems with the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eye to the brain. There are different types of glaucoma, but the most common one is called primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). POAG has a complex genetic basis, meaning that it is caused by a combination of different genes. Previous research has identified a gene called SIX6 that may be involved in POAG. Now, researchers have sequenced the SIX6 gene in people with POAG and those without the disease, and they have found six variants, or changes, in the gene that may be linked to POAG. To test whether these variants are harmful or not, the researchers used zebrafish to look at how the variants affected the size of the eye and the structure of the optic nerve. They also found a clinical feature in people with POAG that seems to be linked to the SIX6 gene. This feature is a thinner layer of nerve cells in the back of the eye. Altogether, these findings suggest that the SIX6 gene may be involved in the development of POAG, and that changes to this gene may lead to problems with the optic nerve and vision loss.   \n",

It produces flagella, which help it to stick to intestinal cells, and glucosylating toxins, which are harmful to people. Flagellar gene expression also affects the production of these toxins. A \"flagellar switch\" has been identified in C . difficile that determines whether the bacteria produce flagellar genes and toxins. This switch is a region of DNA that can flip back and forth, changing the expression of flagellar genes and toxins. Bacteria that have the switch in one orientation produce flagellar genes, toxins, and flagella, while bacteria with the switch in the opposite orientation do not. The orientation of the switch can be changed during growth in the lab. Gene regulation via the switch happens after the switch has turned on the production of flagellar genes. A specific protein is responsible for turning off gene expression when the switch is in the opposite orientation. The tyrosine recombinase RecV, which is responsible for inverting the switch at another location in the genome, also inverts the switch. The phase variable expression of flagellar genes and toxins suggests that they have both beneficial and harmful effects on the bacteria during infection.   \n",

During endosporulation, gene expression is controlled by sigma subunits of RNA polymerase. In the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, sigma subunits such as σF and σE control early stages of development and are replaced later by σG and σK. The activity of these sigma factors is sequential and depends on the previous factor, and involves cell-cell signaling at key stages. In this study, researchers looked at the function and regulation of these sigma subunits in Clostridium difficile, an intestinal pathogen that produces hardy endospores. They found that the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved, but that σE is partially independent of σF, σG activity is not dependent on σE, and σK activity does not require σG. The researchers also found that σK is not strictly required for heat resistant spore formation. Taken together, these results show that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution, but that there are some deviations from the B. subtilis paradigm.   \n",

This reduction can accurately mimic the behavior of more complicated multisite systems, such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model. The best way for these proteins to work is if their individual sites become active together and help each other. This makes the model useful for analyzing systems with several multisite proteins that might interact at the same time. For an example, the study looked at a checkpoint signaling pathway in yeast that measures how fast the cells are growing. The pathway includes a signal that is proportional to the size of the bud (a new part of the cell that grows out from the mother cell), a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response that is triggered only when the signal reaches a certain threshold.   \n",

QS systems are controlled by molecules called autoinducers , which accumulate as bacteria grow and communicate with one another to initiate group behaviors . However, it has been difficult to understand how QS works at a molecular level . To investigate this, we used mathematical models to analyze the quorum sensing system of Escherichia coli ( E . coli ), which uses a molecule called AI-2 to communicate . We found that this system is controlled by a combination of negative and positive feedback loops, which are a type of regulatory mechanism that allow for communication within a network. These feedback loops help to balance the system by controlling the levels of AI-2 and the activity of other proteins involved in QS. We also found that a previously unknown negative feedback loop plays a key role in the functioning of the E . coli QS system. Finally, we developed a simple mathematical model that helped us to understand how these feedback loops interact and control the overall behavior of the QS system. By studying QS in this way, we can better understand how bacterial groups behave and develop strategies to control or disrupt these behaviors if necessary.   \n",

In this study, we looked at how the presence of two parasites, the worm Schistosoma haematobium and the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, affect each other in children in Gabon. We used thick blood smear light microscopy, urine filtration, and Kato-Katz technique to diagnose malaria and worm infections in school-age children. We found that the overall prevalence of malaria, S. haematobium, and co-infection with both parasites was 30%, 23%, and 9% on enrollment, respectively. Our results showed that schistosomiasis increased the risk of malaria infection, but when combined with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection, the risk was even higher. We also found that the incidence of malaria was higher in children infected with S. haematobium compared to children not infected. Overall, our findings suggest that worm infections can enhance the risk of malaria infection and that schistosomiasis may increase susceptibility to malaria in young children but not in older children.   \n",

The immune system's response to this infection is essential for fighting off the parasite . In this study, we investigated the role of a transcription factor called IRF-5 in the immune response to Leishmania . IRF-5 is involved in the production of important inflammatory proteins, such as IL-6 and TNF . We found that the inflammatory response regulated by IRF-5 limits the growth of immune cells called CD8+ T cells and encourages the production of a molecule called HIF-1α in immune cells called dendritic cells (DCs) . When we removed the ability of DCs to produce HIF-1α, we observed that CD8+ T cells grew faster and that IL-12 was produced more by DCs. Furthermore, when we removed the ability of DCs to produce HIF-1α, the parasite burden in the spleen of infected mice was reduced . These results suggest that inducing HIF-1α in DCs may be a way for Leishmania parasites to evade the immune system and cause persistent infections.   \n",

To help medical professionals make better clinical decisions, it would be useful to have a way to predict which patients are more likely to have a bad outcome. This study is a review of studies conducted in Latin America to identify which factors are associated with a bad outcome or death from VL. We found that the most important predictors of bad outcomes were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age less than 5 and older than 40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Other factors, such as edema and low hemoglobin concentration, were also associated with bad outcomes. The main limitation of this study was that many of the prognostic models were not validated, meaning that further research needs to be done to confirm the accuracy of these models. Overall, this study has helped identify important predictors of bad outcomes from VL, which may help medical professionals better care for their patients.   \n",
       "14  In Algeria, the treatment of leishmaniasis, a parasitic infection transmitted by sandflies, has mainly relied on antimony-based drugs. However, high levels of drug use may lead to the emergence of chemoresistant parasites. The level of susceptibility to antimony of Leishmania parasites transmitted in Algeria is not well understood. This study aimed to determine the susceptibility of Leishmania parasites in Algeria to antimony, which is critical for the development of effective public health policies. The study analyzed a total of 106 Leishmania isolates, including 88 isolates from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines collected between 1976 and 2013 in 14 endemic localities in Algeria and 18 isolates from dogs in France. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of potassium antimony tartrate (Sb (III)) and sodium stibogluconate (Sb (V)) were determined in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively. The epidemiological cutoff (ECOFF) that allowed differentiation between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis that were susceptible (S+) or insusceptible (S-) to the trivalent form of antimony was determined. The computed IC50 cutoff values were 23.83 μg/mL and 15.91 μg/mL for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. The study reports a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis isolates during the 30-year period. In contrast, an increase in the frequency of insusceptible phenotypes in isolates causing cutaneous leishmaniasis was observed during the same period. The emergence of insusceptible phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of L. killicki (syn: L. tropica) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and have emerged in Algeria during the last decade. The study provides insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria. The authors highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains.   \n",

Recent studies have linked CD to foodborne pathogens that cause acute gastroenteritis, but the exact relationship is unknown. Therefore, researchers developed two new models to study the comorbidity of gastroenteritis with the bacterial pathobiont, AIEC (adherent-invasive E.coli), which is associated with CD. The results of this study indicate that the tissue-associated expansion of AIEC is responsible for the ongoing relationship between gastroenteritis and CD. Researchers also found that the immune system, intestinal barrier, and recovery after pathogen clearance are affected. This study suggests that individuals with AIEC at the time of acute gastroenteritis have a higher risk of developing CD. Researchers also found that AIEC can be targeted to develop therapeutic interventions for individuals at risk of developing CD after gastroenteritis.   \n",

The female gametophyte is made up of five specialized cells and one large egg cell . A smaller cell called the central cell is next to the egg cell and helps fertilization happen . It's not completely clear how these specialized cells are made during development. In this study , the authors looked for genes that help make the egg cell in the Arabidopsis plant . They found a mutant that made more egg cells than usual. In this mutant, some of the specialized cells made by the plant changed into egg cells instead of their normal job of supporting fertilization. The authors think that a protein called LIS makes a special cell fate happen in the egg cells. The protein LIS is related to a protein made in yeast that helps make things that are used in cell processes . This study shows that the same cell processes that happen in yeast happen in plants too.   \n",

In a rural highland Ethiopian community where podoconiosis is common, we used this tool to understand why and when children do not wear shoes. We talked to 242 people in the community through focus groups, interviews, and case studies. Many people saw going barefoot as “shameful” and thought that shoes were both protective and dignifying. However, many people could not afford to buy new shoes regularly because they were too expensive or not suitable for daily activities. Additionally, some people were worried that wearing certain types of shoes would label them. We think that by understanding these barriers, we can help people wear shoes more often, which can prevent podoconiosis and other diseases caused by walking barefoot.   \n",

PRV's Us9 protein is important for axonal sorting of viral capsids and glycoproteins in infected cells. However, it is unclear how Us9 directs so many viral proteins to axons. We found that Us9 is associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes. Moreover, we determined that the association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and, as a consequence, for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system. In other words, Us9 plays a crucial role in PRV's ability to target and infect specific cells in the body.   \n",

This \"nongenetic heterogeneity\" has important implications for medicine because it can lead to different growth rates or responses to drugs or stresses in cells such as tumors and bacteria. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, scientists have found that growth rate correlates with susceptibility to heat stress in individual cells. By using genetic and chemical manipulations, combined with high-throughput single-cell assays, they found that heterogeneity in the levels of intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its effects on the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway are the underlying cause of this nongenetic heterogeneity. Lower levels of cAMP in cells correspond to slower growth rates, and a reporter of PKA pathway activity also correlates with growth rates in individual cells. The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 have different roles in nongenetic heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in growth rate requires both paralogs, but only Msn2 is required for heterogeneity in stress tolerance. Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in the cAMP-PKA pathway or by culturing wild-type cells with cAMP analogs or PKA inhibitors affects the survival of acute heat stress. Perturbations that increase cAMP levels reduce the slower-growing subpopulation and increase susceptibility to acute heat stress, whereas PKA inhibition slows growth and increases susceptibility to acute heat stress. Loss of Msn2 reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the correlation in individual cells between growth rate and acute-stress survival, suggesting a major role for the Msn2 pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity but also a residual benefit of slow growth. These results provide insight into the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment.   \n",

This virus is known to cause fever, joint pain and rash in humans. In the past, CHIKV has only affected tropical and subtropical areas around the world. But now it is spreading quickly in North and South America. To understand how this virus is evolving in this new region, researchers have used advanced technology called deep-sequencing to look at the genetic makeup of CHIKV in people who are infected with the virus. They found that there are many different versions of the virus circulating in people's bodies, each with slight differences in their genetic code. These genetic differences are known as minor variants. The researchers also found that the overall genetic diversity of the virus decreased after it was passed through cells in the lab. This suggests that the virus is adapting to its new environment. Additionally, the researchers discovered a new genetic structure, or UTR ( untranslated region ) in the virus's genome. This new UTR may help the virus to replicate better in cells in the lab. Overall, this study provides important information about how the virus is changing in this new environment. It also highlights the need to continue tracking the evolution of the virus over time to see how it continues to change.   \n",

In this study, we found a new gene called UBTOR that regulates cell growth and mTOR signaling. When we reduced UBTOR function in neurons and a type of cancer cell line, cells grew longer neurites and had more cell colonies, respectively. On the other hand, overexpression of UBTOR in cancer cells inhibited colony formation. UBTOR stabilizes a key component of the mTOR complex called DEPTOR, and when UBTOR function is reduced, DEPTOR is lost, leading to increased mTOR signaling. We also found that when the ubtor gene was disrupted, the zebrafish developed faster tumors when a cancer-causing gene (HRAS) was introduced, and this was associated with increased mTOR signaling. Finally, we found that reducing UBTOR function in a mouse model of cancer also promoted tumor growth and increased mTOR signaling. These results show that UBTOR plays a critical role in controlling cell growth and cancer development via the mTOR signaling pathway.   \n",

To understand protein functions, scientists study how proteins work together in complexes. However, there is currently no map of which proteins work together in Trypanosomatida. Here, scientists used advanced methods to study how proteins work together in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei . They identified 128 protein complexes that included 716 proteins, many of which had not been studied before. The proteins in these complexes often work together in known pathways or are expressed similarly across different stages of the parasite's life cycle. The scientists also discovered a potential role for a novel protein in the mitochondrial regulation of T . brucei , the parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis.

While lung infection is the most common , Mtb can also infect other parts of the body like lymph nodes ( LNs ). LNs are among the most common sites of Mtb infection in humans and macaques . Mtb-infected LNs can change the LN structure and function . We studied Mtb-infected LNs in macaques and found that different LNs can have different responses to Mtb infection . Rhesus macaques , who are more susceptible to Mtb infection than cynomolgus macaques , have more extensive LN pathology . Despite having the same amount of Mtb in their LNs , cynomolgus macaques controlled Mtb infection better than rhesus macaques . LNs are also generally poor at killing Mtb , even with drug treatment . LNs are important sites for Mtb persistence, serving as niches for Mtb growth and survival . Our study shows that LNs are not only important sites for immune activation during infection , but also play an important role in Mtb persistence .   \n",

The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has recently been identified as a host for a specific type of microsporidia, Nematocida parisii. To learn more about microsporidia infections in C . elegans, researchers collected wild nematodes from diverse environments and analyzed their microsporidian infections. They found that N . parisii is the most common microsporidian infecting C . elegans, but they also found six new species in the Nematocida genus, as well as two other genera that are genetically distinct from Nematocida . These new species provide a rich resource to study the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes and how they interact with their hosts.   \n",

Some studies have shown that these receptors work together in different ways to affect their function . However , there is limited information about the specific ways that these receptors interact and are affected by cholesterol . In this study , we used computer simulations to determine the specific ways that the receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 work together and are affected by cholesterol. We found that the receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 form similar homodimers (dimerization patterns), but differ significantly from the CC chemokine receptors . We also found that cholesterol affects the receptors in a subtype-specific way. Finally , we found that associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased sensitivity to cholesterol as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns .   \n",

However, there are several different forms of leishmaniasis, and some people with this condition may not show all of these typical symptoms. In this report, the authors describe a third form of systemic leishmaniasis that is characterized by atypical symptoms, such as lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) and anemia (low red blood cell count). To identify this new form of leishmaniasis, the authors performed specialized tests on blood and biopsy samples from patients suspected to have a weakened immune system. They found that 19.4% of these patients had normal laboratory test results but were found to have macrophages (a type of immune cell) that were loaded with parasites and were not functioning properly. These findings suggest that systemic leishmaniasis may present with a wider variety of symptoms than previously thought, and it may be more common than currently diagnosed. The authors recommend considering the diagnosis of atypical systemic leishmaniasis in any patient who has a weakened immune system and no clear immunologic defect.   \n",

The authors have collected disease-causing variants from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man ( OMIM ) and the Human Genome Mutation Database ( HGMD ) and used them to identify and characterize pairs of variants at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins . The study found that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. The results show that information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.   \n",

The parasite, called Plasmodium falciparum, is exposed to different environments within the human body . These different environments can cause severe disease, but it is not clear how the parasite responds or is selected by these environments. To investigate this, researchers used a technique called RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze the genes expressed in 44 parasite isolates that caused either severe or uncomplicated malaria in patients from Papua, Indonesia. The parasites that caused severe malaria had changes in how their cells worked, including how they used glucose for energy, and how their genes were regulated. They also had lower levels of surface proteins called PfEMP1s, which are important targets of immunity against malaria. The study also found new associations between specific PfEMP1s and severe malaria, which can help identify potential targets for a vaccine against severe malaria.   \n",

However, antibodies against HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) have not been able to effectively prevent HIV from spreading . Scientists are investigating the use of strong, broadly-neutralizing antibodies to prevent HIV infections. In this study, researchers injected a specific type of antibody (IgG1 form) into rhesus monkeys via a virus-like particle (AAV) . The antibody was able to persist in the monkeys' bloodstream at high concentrations. However, the monkeys' bodies responded to the antibody and produced their own antibodies against the delivered antibody. This response limited how much antibody could be delivered and achieved. Despite the lower levels of delivered antibody, the monkeys showed significant protection against a difficult-to-neutralize virus, including lower levels of viral load at peak height and set point, and a delay in the time to peak viral load. The monkey with the highest level of delivered antibody completely resisted multiple virus challenges. While the study is promising, the researchers noted that the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be addressed in order for this approach to be fully effective.   \n",

However, we recently found that this is not always the case. In particular, the conformational motions of two important protein motors, myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, did not conform to this linear response. We used computer simulations to study these proteins and found that the linear response assumption failed in describing certain ligand-induced conformational motions. Additionally, the normal mode description, which is commonly used to analyze thermal fluctuations, also failed in describing certain functional mechanochemical motions. These results suggest that important assumptions made in the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered. Linear approximations may not be sufficient to capture important nonlinear dynamics.   \n",

In order to perform these functions, cells must be able to take in materials and substances from their environment. This process, called endocytosis , involves the cell engulfing and taking in molecules and particles from its surroundings. There are several different ways that cells can accomplish endocytosis, including through a process called clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE) . The CIE process is believed to be regulated by a group of proteins known as caveolins and cavins . In this study, researchers set out to investigate the relationship between CIE and caveolins and cavins. They found that certain caveolins and cavins can inhibit CIE, meaning they can limit the amount of material taken into the cell through this process. They also found that these proteins have other functions besides just regulating CIE, and that their absence can have consequences for the cell's overall behavior and function. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of caveolins and cavins in regulating CIE and their other functions, and how their absence can affect the cell's overall behavior.   \n",

In these systems, a protein called a sensory histidine kinase receives a signal and then passes that signal along to another protein called a Receiver (REC) domain. The REC domain usually has a particular aspartate (Asp) residue that is phosphorylated by the sensory histidine kinase. In the past, scientists have noticed that some REC domains don't have this phosphorylatable Asp residue. Now, researchers have compiled all the REC domains that are missing their phosphorylatable Asp residue, and they have named this group of proteins \"Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains\". They have found that ALR domains are surprisingly common and are often linked to rare types of effects. The researchers also studied the structure and function of ALR domains in more detail and found that they have reorganized their active pockets to take on different roles or accept different types of signals. This research provides a new understanding of the ALR subclass of REC domains.   \n",

Most oHSVs gain cancer-specificity from deletions or mutations in genes that prevent the virus from being recognized by the immune system, but this also makes them weaker or less active. We developed a new type of oHSV called R-LM113 and R-115, which have no deletions or mutations, gain specificity by binding to tumor cells through a protein called HER2, and are fully-active. In this study, we tested R-LM113 and R-115 in immunocompetent mice with lung cancer. We found that both viruses were safe and effective at shrinking the primary tumor, and R-115 was even more effective. Furthermore, we found that R-115 caused the immune system to be more active against the cancer cells, and this lasted even after the primary tumor was gone. This is known as an \"abscopal\" effect, which means that the immune system is activated not only in the tumor where the virus was injected, but also in a second, untreated tumor. We also found that R-115 caused the immune system to break its \"tolerance\" of the cancer cells, which means that the immune system started to attack the cancer cells even in the absence of the virus. This is a sign that the virus is working as a vaccine to protect against future tumors. In summary, R-LM113 and R-115 are safe and effective at treating cancer, and cause the immune system to be more active against cancer cells even after the primary tumor is gone. This makes them promising candidates for future cancer treatments.   \n",

There is concern that the HIV infections in the Ad5 trial were caused by the vaccine vector itself rather than the HIV virus itself. In this study, we examined the HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by a different vaccine vector, ALVAC ( canarypox virus ), which was used in a vaccine trial in Thailand ( RV144 ). We found that CD4 T cells induced by ALVAC were much less susceptible to HIV infection than CD4 T cells induced by Ad5. This lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells was associated with a lack of surface expression of key HIV entry co-receptors, which are important for HIV infection. Interestingly, ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells also had a strong Th1 phenotype, which is associated with protection against HIV infection. On the other hand, Ad5-induced CD4 T cells had a strong Th2 phenotype, which is associated with poor protection against HIV infection. In addition, ALVAC and Ad5 induced distinct profiles of CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses, with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation while Ad5 induced CD4 T-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.   \n",

This has been thought to be a way for the female body to balance out the number of X chromosomes inherited from each parent . However , the rules that govern which X chromosome copy is silenced can vary between different species . Some species, such as mice, silence the X chromosome inherited from the father, while others, like humans, silence the X chromosome inherited from the mother . In this study, researchers used mathematical models to determine how various genetic factors, such as how genes are expressed relative to one another ( called dominance ), the degree to which genes are physically linked to one another ( called linkage ), the frequency of recombination between genes on the X chromosome, and how genes are expressed differently in males and females ( called sex-differential selection ), influence the rules of X inactivation . The results suggest that a combination of genetic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a wide range of X inactivation strategies, from one in which the X chromosome inherited from the father is always silenced, to one in which both X chromosomes are expressed equally in each tissue . This study provides a framework for understanding how the different rules of X inactivation have evolved across different species.   \n",

While many viruses have been known to be blocked by ZAP, a type of flavivirus called Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been thought to be resistant. Here , we tested whether JEV is actually resistant to ZAP. First, we found that overexpression of ZAP can block JEV infection, but not that of other types of flaviviruses like dengue virus or Zika virus. Then, we showed that ZAP can specifically target JEV RNA for degradation, and this is done through ZAP’s zinc-finger motifs. Finally, we found that JEV has a specific region of its RNA, especially in the 3′-end, that is targeted by ZAP, and this region is composed of a high content of CG dinucleotide and dumbbell structures. These findings reveal that JEV is actually sensitive to ZAP, and ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor by specifically binding to this JEV RNA region to fight against JEV infection.   \n",

RVFV is native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula but there is a risk that it could spread to non-endemic regions and cause devastating effects on livestock and humans . To better understand RVFV pathogenesis and immune response, researchers infected C57BL/6 mice with either a wild-type strain or a vaccine strain. The animals infected with the vaccine strain had little to no evidence of clinical disease or cytokine response. On the other hand, animals infected with the wild-type strain had severe disease characterized by lymphocyte and platelet depletion, a strong cytokine response, high virus titers, and tissue pathology. Lymphocyte and platelet depletion were indicative of disease onset and were correlated with increases in G-CSF production, suggesting that G-CSF may be a potential treatment. RVFV is known to be hepatotropic, and the virus resulted in significant clinical and histological data indicating hepatitis. However, the pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent, and instead, a chemokine response was evident, suggesting infiltration of immunoreactive cells such as neutrophils. In the brains of infected mice, a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, but with little pathology, indicating meningoencephalitis. These data suggest that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with liver necrosis and hepatitis, but the long-term course of disease for those that survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature, as observed in human disease and in the BALB/c mouse model .   \n",

A recent study by Xie et al. found that a protein called C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) becomes more active during chemotherapy in TNBC patients. CCL20 activates a specific type of cell called a breast cancer stem cell ( BCSC ) and makes it more likely to become resistant to chemotherapy. Additionally, CCL20 activates a protein called p65 nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) that helps BCSCs survive. The study also found that NF-κB activates the production of CCL20, creating a \"positive feedback loop\" that sustains the resistance of BCSCs to chemotherapy. The study suggests that CCL20 may be a useful predictor of whether a patient will respond to chemotherapy, and that blocking CCL20 or its effects could make TNBC patients more sensitive to chemotherapy.   \n",

Toxoplasma's ability to infect and manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport \"GRA\" proteins, which originate in unique secretory organelles called dense granules into the host cell. These GRA proteins have diverse roles in Toxoplasma's intracellular lifecycle, including co-opting crucial host cell functions and proteins, such as the cell cycle, c-Myc and p38 MAP kinase. Some of these GRA proteins, such as GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within which Toxoplasma replicates and are transported across the PV membrane (PVM) into the host cell. In this study, the authors identified additional proteins necessary for the transport of these GRAs into the host cell by screening Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus. They found that novel proteins MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell. These proteins are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1, which is cleaved by TgASP5 into two fragments. These three proteins are membrane-associated, and MYR3, but not MYR2, stably associates with MYR1. The authors also showed that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. Overall, these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell.   \n",

This process happens in several stages. First, the DNA is copied a few times upon infection. Next, during the cell cycle, the DNA is copied a few more times. Finally, when the cell differentiates (or matures), the DNA is copied a lot more. In this study, the authors found that HPV E2 binds to a protein called ORC2, which is a key player in starting the process of DNA replication. However, the authors did not find that ORC2 is important for the process of copying HPV DNA. In fact, the authors found that ORC2 actually suppresses the ability of E2 to start copying the DNA. This result is surprising because ORC2 is usually needed to start the process of copying DNA in cells. The authors also found that when the HPV E2 protein is overexpressed, it restricts the ability of ORC2 to start the process of copying DNA at known locations in the human genome. This result suggests that HPV E2 may be interfering with the process of copying DNA at these locations. These findings provide new insights into the complex relationship between viral proteins and cellular proteins during the process of viral DNA replication.   \n",

The disease is particularly prevalent in Central Asia and has a significant impact on human health and livelihoods . In low-income countries, many people live in urban areas and keep livestock in close proximity to their homes, increasing the risk of zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis spreading to humans. To investigate the prevalence of brucellosis in urban and peri-urban areas of Dushanbe, Tajikistan, researchers collected samples of cow milk from 564 cows and used a real-time PCR test to detect the presence of Brucella DNA. They found that 5.3% of the cows were infected with Brucella, and that the disease was present in both seropositive and seronegative cows. The researchers used DNA sequencing to determine that the two seronegative cows were likely infected with different species of Brucella. These findings highlight the need for developing new diagnostic strategies to identify false seronegative individuals and for further research to understand the spread of brucellosis in this region. The study also suggests that vaccination of cows with S19 and small ruminants with Rev 1 may be necessary to control the disease.   \n",

These accessory chromosomes can have repetitive elements, be transcriptionally repressed, and have many histone methylation marks, such as methylation of lysine 9 or 27 on histone 3 (H3K9me3 or H3K27me3). To better understand how these marks affect chromosome and genome stability in fungi, scientists deleted the genes responsible for producing these marks in the pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, which has up to eight accessory chromosomes. To investigate this, they used whole genome sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq), and RNA sequencing to compare the changes in genome and chromatin structure, as well as differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains. They found that the loss of H3K9me3 led to the relocalization of H3K27me3, formation of new chromosomes, and the activation of transposable elements. On the other hand, the loss of H3K27me3 actually increased the stability of accessory chromosomes, but this was not accompanied by large-scale changes in gene activity. The scientists concluded that H3K9me3 helps to maintain genome stability by preventing H3K27me3 from forming in certain regions of the genome. In other words, H3K27me3 helps to create a \"metastable\" state for certain regions of the genome, which are important but not essential for the fungus's survival.   \n",

To prevent the onset of rabies in people who have been exposed to it, they need to receive a special kind of vaccination called post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) as soon as possible. Unfortunately , life-saving vaccines and biologicals for rabies are hard to get and expensive, especially for the poorest people who are at the greatest risk of getting rabies . It is important to find ways to make it easier for people who have been exposed to rabies to get the vaccination they need, and to do it at a lower cost. In this study , researchers found that giving people the rabies vaccine through their skin ( intradermal delivery ) instead of through a muscle ( intramuscular delivery ) is just as effective but uses a lot less vaccine. This means that it is possible to treat more people with the same amount of vaccine, which could help solve problems with vaccine shortages. In addition , this study shows that using intradermal delivery is much cheaper than intramuscular delivery. The researchers suggest ways that governments and other organizations can pay for the vaccines so that more people can get them. This would make it easier for people to get the treatment they need to prevent rabies, and it would also be cheaper for organizations to provide this treatment. Overall, this study shows that it is important to use intradermal delivery of PEP to make it more accessible and affordable for people who have been exposed to rabies, and that this could lead to a reduction in human deaths from rabies.   \n",

In the current study, the authors looked at how Toxoplasma acquires nutrients from host cells. They found that lipid droplets (LDs) in the host cells are a source of lipids for the parasite, and that parasites are able to access and utilize lipids from LDs to build their own membranes and organelles. The authors also found that Toxoplasma uses an intravacuolar network of membranes to scavenge lipids from host LDs inside the PV. In addition, the authors discovered that when parasites are fed lipids, they create endocytic-like structures to absorb the excess lipids from the PV. The study highlights the importance of host LDs in supporting the growth of Toxoplasma, and the parasite's ability to acquire lipids from these organelles.   \n",

There is concern that fasciolosis is becoming more common among humans, making it an emerging zoonotic disease. Currently, chemotherapy is the primary way to control fasciolosis, but it is not always effective due to the presence of resistant parasites. To find new ways to control this disease, scientists have searched for drugs that can kill the juvenile and mature stages of the parasites. In this study, the researchers found chalcones, which are a type of flavonoid, could kill juvenile liver flukes by interacting with key parts of the enzymes that digest proteins. One chalcone, C34, was particularly effective and reduced the ability of the young larvae to penetrate the gut wall and decreased their viability in the laboratory. This is an exciting discovery, as it provides a new potential treatment for fasciolosis. The researchers hope that this finding can lead to the development of new drugs to control fasciolosis and potentially other helminthic diseases.   \n",

These cells send the information to the inner retina. Using imaging techniques, we studied how these cells transmit information about fast and slow changes in light intensity. We found that the size of the synaptic terminal is an important property that affects how fast and slow changes in light intensity are transmitted. Each bipolar cell has multiple terminals of different sizes, and smaller terminals transmit faster and more effectively. Modeling the global calcium dynamics shows that the size of the presynaptic compartment is directly linked to the adaptability of these neurons. This suggests that bipolar cells can transmit different components of the visual signal through synaptic terminals with different adaptational properties.   \n",

Fluorescence microscopy ( FM ) can detect many different molecules in synapses quickly and cheaply, but it is difficult to distinguish between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals. Electron microscopy ( EM ) is the best tool for seeing individual synapses clearly, but it is slow, expensive, and cannot tell which molecules are in the synapse. To address this issue, researchers have developed a new method for detecting synapses using fluorescence microscopy images and comparing them to electron microscopy images. They found that their new method was just as good as human annotators at detecting synapses and reproducing important features of synapse distributions, such as the types of molecules in the synapse and the number of synapses in a certain region of the brain. This new tool is likely to be useful for analyzing standard fluorescence microscopy images and could help scientists discover new types of synapses.   \n",

Zinc moves in and out of cells through two families of transporters, called ZnT and ZIP . One of these transporters, called ZnT2, is responsible for zinc transport during breastfeeding . However, we do not know exactly how ZnT2 works. In this study, we have created a model of how ZnT2 works and have shown that it transports zinc using the proton gradient in acidic vesicles. Using special inhibitors and markers to track the pH inside vesicles, we have shown that when we add zinc to acidic vesicles, the vesicles get less acidic. This happens because ZnT2 takes in protons and gives away zinc. We have also calculated the math behind this process and found that ZnT2 exchanges two protons for every zinc ion. Overall, ZnT2 is an important transporter that helps us maintain our zinc levels and overall health.   \n",

During this process, cells use a machinery called the replication fork to move down the DNA strand and make a copy of it . 14-3-3 proteins are able to sense when the replication fork is not working properly and respond by activating special proteins called checkpoints . Exonuclease 1 ( Exo1 ) is a protein that processes stalled replication forks when the checkpoints are not working . We now know that 14-3-3 proteins bind to Exo1 in both yeast and human cells . When 14-3-3 proteins are missing in yeast, the checkpoint does not properly activate Exo1 and more DNA damage occurs at the stalled forks. We have also found that 14-3-3 proteins help to promote the movement of the replication fork under stressful conditions such as low levels of nutrients in the cell. This suggests that 14-3-3 proteins play an important role in making sure that DNA is copied accurately during cell division.   \n",

To help them study this, they developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC from all lymphoid organs. They used this antibody to deplete pDC before HIV-1 infection in a humanized mouse model. During acute HIV-1 infection, they found that the induction of type I interferons (IFN-I) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished in pDC-depleted mice. This was consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, as HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1-induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs, but not the blood, was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication. This was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells. The scientists conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis. These findings suggest that pDC depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retroviral treatment.   \n",

However, whether Nrf2 activation affects human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection is unknown. A substance called sulforaphane ( SFN ), found in cruciferous vegetables after injury, activates Nrf2 to reprogram gene expression. We have found that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. This blockade of infection is due to Nrf2 activation, which is mobilized by SFN. We also found that SFN treatment blocks HIV infection after entry but before 2-LTR circles are formed, and that neither SAMHD1 nor MX2 are upregulated. This suggests that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection and highlights a novel way to trigger this inhibition.   \n",

During a study in Kenya , researchers found that about 76% of pregnant women had at least one geohelminth infection . Many of these women lived in areas with poor water supply and sanitation . The most common geohelminths found in the study were Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura. Although these infections were common, the researchers did not find any major negative effects on the pregnant women, such as clinical symptoms or weight loss. However, hookworm infections were associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference and lower hemoglobin levels in women with high egg counts. This suggests that hookworm infections may have some negative effects on the health of pregnant women, especially when the infection is severe. The researchers also found that women with Ascaris lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasites in their blood than women without Ascaris lumbricoides. This suggests that geohelminth infections may have some protective effects against malaria parasites. Overall, the study highlights the importance of addressing geohelminth infections in pregnant women in areas with poor water supply and sanitation.   \n",

In this study, we investigated whether mycolactone also affects the inflammatory responses of cells involved in pain perception and maintenance, such as sensory neurons, Schwann cells (which wrap around nerve fibers), and microglia (a type of immune cell found in the brain). We found that mycolactone inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by these cells within the first 24 hours of exposure, without affecting their viability. Additionally, mycolactone prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia. To investigate whether mycolactone affects neuroinflammation in vivo, we used a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve. Mycolactone was injected daily for three days into the spinal canal, and we found that it decreased the local production of inflammatory cytokines without causing detectable cytotoxicity. In summary, mycolactone suppressed the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia without affecting their viability, which may partially explain the analgesic properties of mycolactone.   \n",

The IL6 gene was found to be associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease (p = 0.0001, OR = 0.39, CI95 = [0.24–0.63], BONF = 0.0034). Similarly, the MIF gene was found to be associated with an increased risk of developing HAT (p = 0.0239, OR = 1.65, CI95 = [1.07–2.53], BONF = 0.6697), although this association did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. The MIF gene was also found to be associated with latent infections (p = 0.0077, OR = 1.86, CI95 = [1.18–2.95], BONF = 0.2157). The APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) was found to be associated with a higher risk of developing HAT (p = 0.0011, OR = 2.70, CI95 = [1.49–4.91], BONF = 0.0301), while the APOL1 G1 polymorphism was found to be associated with a lower risk of developing HAT (p = 0.0005, OR = 0.45, CI95 = [0.29–0.70], BONF = 0.0129). No other associations were found with other candidate genes. Overall, these results suggest that host genetic factors are involved in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea, and may lead to the development of new control tools.   \n",

Extending beyond the protein-coding sequence of a given mRNA is an additional stretch of sequence , harboring signals that govern how much protein is made and how long the mRNA remains in the cell before it is broken down . The incorporation of this end region into mature mRNA is itself subject to change; for the vast majority of human genes , how and why cells use different mRNA ends remains largely unknown . In this work , we surveyed mRNA ends from ∼10 , 000 genes in immune cells from genetically distinct human individuals . We found that mRNA end positions were not randomly distributed , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of regulatory signals that govern mRNA fate . The usage of these mRNA length forms and regulatory elements varied across individuals and could be dissected molecularly . Our results uncover key mechanisms and regulatory effects of transcript end processing , particularly as these are perturbed by genetic differences between humans .   \n",

Due to the ability of the virus to escape host immune responses , designing a successful HIV vaccine has been elusive . Similar to HIV in humans , rhesus macaques can be infected with SIV , a close relative and ancestor of HIV , resulting in simian AIDS . SIVΔnef , a live attenuated form of SIV , protects rhesus macaques from subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIV and is widely viewed as the most effective SIV vaccine . Here , we demonstrate that after vaccination of macaques with SIVΔnef , the immune response initially targets more variable regions of the virus , which the virus rapidly escapes . However , as the virus escapes , the immune response evolves to target more conserved regions of the virus as well as escape variants . This refocused targeting of conserved regions by the immune response provides a new mechanistic model that contributes to our understanding of how SIVΔnef vaccination protects animals from pathogenic challenge with SIV . Our findings also reinforce the importance of developing HIV vaccines that target conserved regions of the virus as well as their potential variants .   \n",

The cytokine interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) plays a critical role for antifungal host defense and was proposed to act by regulating neutrophil recruitment to the oral mucosa . However , although IL-17 can promote neutrophil trafficking in some situations , we recently showed in a mouse model that this is not the case during OPC . Thus , the mechanism governing the neutrophil response to C . albicans remained to be determined . Here , we demonstrate an essential role of IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling in the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation to the infected tissue via enhanced secretion of chemokines and increased output of neutrophils from the bone marrow . We found that IL-1α is released from keratinocytes upon invasion of C . albicans and acts on endothelial cells to induce the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , a key trigger of emergency granulopoiesis . Thereby , IL-1R signaling translates the local response to the fungus in the oral mucosa into a systemic response that critically contributes to protection from infection .   \n",

In 83 countries worldwide , more than 1 . 3 billion people are at risk of infection with an estimated 120 million individuals already infected . A recent publication reviewing the health impact of the first 8 years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) demonstrated the enormous health benefits achieved in populations receiving annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) , as a result of infection prevented , disease progression halted , and ancillary treatment of co-infections . To date , however , no studies have estimated the economic value of these health benefits , either to the individuals or the societies afflicted with LF . Our study estimates that US$21 . 8 billion will be gained among individuals benefitting from just the first 8 years of the Global Programme , and an additional US$2 . 2 billion will be saved by the health systems of endemic countries . Treating endemic populations is possible at very low cost – particularly because of the generous drug donations from two pharmaceutical companies – but results in enormous economic benefits . Findings from this study yield a much clearer understanding the GPELF's full economic impact and strengthen the conviction that it is a ‘best buy’ in global health .   \n",

Recent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) , a causative gene of Gaucher disease ( GD ) , are a strong risk for PD . However , its pathological mechanisms leading to PD remain largely unknown . Here , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka which survive long enough for pathological analysis of disease progression . These mutant medaka display not only the phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD but also axonal accumulation of α-syn accompanied by impairment of the autophagy-lysosome pathway . Furthermore , the present study demonstrates this α-syn accumulation has negligible contribution to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . GBA-/- medaka represent a valuable model for exploring the pathological mechanisms of PD with GBA mutations as well as neuronopathic GD , and our findings have important implications for the association of GBA mutations with PD .   \n",

Limiting or preventing infections by intracellular pathogens requires the activation of innate immunity and the consequent generation of effector and memory T cells , which recognize and kill infected cells . Investigators are currently testing attenuated versions of pathogenic microbes as vaccines in an attempt to generate pathogen-specific T cells without causing disease . Unfortunately , attenuated microbes often fail to elicit long-lived protective immunity . We hypothesized that attenuated bacterial vaccines do not immunize because they fail to activate a stimulatory arm of host innate immune receptors . However , we found that these attenuated bacterial vaccines are not simply prevented from activating immunity , but rather generate a negative signal that inhibits the desired immune response . These studies may explain why the addition of an adjuvant to ineffective vaccines does not necessarily improve immunogenicity . Furthermore , these studies provide a framework for the development of attenuated vaccines that do not inhibit the desired immune responses .   \n",

To help understand the mechanisms of this disease and to design more effective treatments , we identified previously a locus , SIX6 , that increases the risk of glaucoma . This gene is involved in early eye development and helps to form the retina . In this paper , we test specific sequence variants in SIX6 that are found in glaucoma patients . We show that these variants have a reduced function that interferes with their ability to direct proper formation of the retina . One variant in particular is common , and may be the main reason that this gene is important in the glaucoma disease process . Patients who have two copies of this sequence variant show a change in the structure of their eye consistent with fewer neurons that carry the visual signal to the brain . These neurons typically die as people age , and people who begin life with fewer visual neurons may have an increased risk of glaucoma . Additional research in this topic may lead to new treatments that preserve sight .   \n",

Colonization of host tissues is a prerequisite step to disease development during bacterial infection . C . difficile produces flagella , which are proteinaceous structures on the bacterial surface that confer motility and participate in adherence to the host intestine . SigD , a regulator that coordinates flagellar gene expression , also activates expression of the toxin genes in C . difficile . Therefore , mechanisms controlling expression of flagellar genes , including sigD , will likely impact the severity of C . difficile infection given the impact on toxin production . In this body of work , we identified a genetic ON/OFF switch , which we term the “flagellar switch” , encoded upstream of the flagellar genes . The orientation of the flagellar switch determines whether or not C . difficile produce flagella , engage in swimming motility , and secrete toxins . We identified the enzyme that catalyzes inversion of the flagellar switch . Inactivation of the corresponding gene resulted in bacteria with the flagellar switch locked in the either the ON or OFF orientation , with concomitant effects on flagellum and toxin biosynthesis . The flagellar switch may represent a new regulatory strategy to coordinately control virulence determinants independent of previously described regulators .   \n",

Endospore development has been extensively studied in Bacillus subtilis . The process starts with an asymmetric division that forms a larger mother cell and a smaller forespore . Gene expression in these two cells is primarily governed by four cell type-specific RNA polymerase sigma factors , two active sequentially in the mother cell and two active sequentially in the forespore . The precise timing of sigma factor activation is coordinated between the mother cell and forespore by several mechanisms . By combining studies of gene expression at the single cell level with the phenotypic characterization of mutants for the sigma genes , we describe the regulation of gene expression during endospore development by the intestinal pathogen C . difficile . In this organism , the endospore is the vehicle for transmission and persistence in the host and the environment . The overall picture that emerges is of a developmental program in which the coordination of gene expression between the forespore and mother cell is less tight than in B . subtilis , in what may be a general feature of endospore formation in the more ancient Clostridia group of bacteria .   \n",

This can help bring about interesting dynamical behaviors such as bistability or all-or-none responses to stimuli . Such behaviors are in turn important for cellular decision-making , differentiation , or the regulation of cellular processes . In this paper we propose the use of a specific technique for modeling allosteric multisite proteins , which can be thought of as the reduced version of a more detailed set of reactions . After validating this technique computationally by comparison to more detailed systems , we apply it to a new model of a signal transduction pathway with several multisite proteins . The model is concerned with a mechanism in budding yeast that is thought to measure the extent of daughter bud growth and send a signal to initiate mitosis when sufficient growth has occurred . Using the given framework we derive an analytically tractable model that creates the desired all-or-none signal . Overall , we give quantitative support to a newly discovered biochemical pathway , and we show the utility of the new modeling framework in the context of a realistic biological problem .   \n",

One particular form of communication in E . coli is through a universal signaling molecule known as autoinducer 2 . Although the importance of this form of cell-cell interaction has been recognized in the formation of biofilms and virulent infections , the mechanisms by which this form of communication is regulated is still not well understood . In this paper , we presented a method of unraveling these mechanisms by using a combination of experimental work and mathematical models . We took apart the network architecture and isolated the different components . The examination of these isolated sub-networks provided us with a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control and regulate bacterial quorum sensing .

The interactions between both are manifold and complex , requiring further investigation . We report here that Trichuris trichiura or hookworm associated with schistosomiasis increase the risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection; whilst schistosomiasis is independently associated with a malaria increase in young children , but not in the older children . Our finding is an additional evidence that optimizing helminth control mainly in children contributes to overcoming malaria in areas endemic for both parasitic infections where children are those who bear the highest burden of these infections .   \n",

The transcription factor IRF-5 is mainly responsible for initiating the inflammatory response following experimental Leishmani donovani infection . IRF-5 activates several genes encoding key pro-inflammatory cytokines , such as IL-6 and TNF . In this study , we investigate the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses during L . donovani infection . Our data demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced by IRF-5 limits the expansion CD8+ T cell . This negative effect is mediated by the induction of HIF-1α in dendritic cells . Indeed , we observed a significant increase in CD8+ T cell expansion in mice lacking HIF-1α expression in dendritic cells . Moreover , these mice had a significantly lower parasite burden in the spleen , suggesting that induction of HIF-1α may represent an immune evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections .   \n",

The fatality rates associated with this disease have remained stable at a high level over the years in Brazil and are neither recorded in under-treatment patients from endemic countries of the Old World nor from non-endemic countries where such cases are imported . Since VL-induced lethality can occur even after the implementation of recommended therapy , the understanding of individual , clinical and laboratory factors that predispose to an unfavorable outcome might represent an important feature for informing better practice in the clinical management of cases . The present systematic review with meta-analysis brings together information on various prognostic variables associated with the severity of VL . Potential predictors identified in the studies surveyed were grouped according to the strength of evidence available , and 13 were considered to be of significant relevance . The gaps in the existing knowledge and the need for the development of externally validated prognostic models were also discussed . The results presented herein could be useful in identifying patients at higher risk of unfavorable evolution or death from VL , and might provide an aid in decision-making regarding the clinical management of VL cases .   \n",

It is suspected that high drug selective pressure might favor the emergence of chemoresistant parasites . Within the framework of knowledge about the epidemiology of VL and CL amassed during the last 30 years , we sampled Leishmania isolates to analyze their susceptibility to antimony . The epidemiological cutoff ( ECOFF ) that allowed us to differentiate between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmanioses that were susceptible ( S+ ) or insusceptible ( S- ) to the trivalent form of antimony was determined . The computed IC50 cutoff values were 23 . 83 μg/mL and 15 . 91 μg/mL for VL and CL , respectively . We report a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility of VL isolates during the 30-year period . In contrast , an increase in the frequency of S- phenotypes in isolates causing CL was observed during the same period . The emergence of these S- phenotypes appears to correlate with the appearance of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L . killicki ( syn: L . tropica ) . We highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony resistance status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant srains .   \n",

A large body of evidence supports the view that bacteria in the gut participate in the pathophysiology of human bowel diseases . The unifying concept is chronic inflammation that is driven by microbial stimulation of the mucosal immune system . However , the mechanisms by which pathogenic or commensal microbes work in concert with each other and with host responses to perpetuate this inflammation is not well known . Adherent-invasive E . coli ( AIEC ) are Crohn’s disease ( CD ) -associated bacteria that are implicated in disease pathology . AIEC are pro-inflammatory and may play a central role in maintaining chronic inflammation in response to other CD risk factors , such as acute infectious gastroenteritis . Here , we show that indeed , acute infectious gastroenteritis creates an inflammatory environment in the gut that drives AIEC expansion and worsens disease severity . The increase in disease severity strictly correlates with this AIEC bloom because blocking this bloom by sensitizing AIEC to host defenses also improves the health status of the host . The long time period between recovery from acute gastroenteritis and new onset CD may allow for targeted interventions to mitigate the risk of CD in AIEC-positive individuals .   \n",

In most higher plants , the egg cell forms in a specialized structure consisting of four different cell types . Two cells , the egg cell and the central cell , are fertilized by sperm cells and develop into the embryo proper and the nutritive tissue ( endosperm ) , respectively . These two gametic cells are flanked by accessory cells; but why do some cells become gametic while others differentiate into accessory cells ? To answer this question , we looked for mutants in which this process is disturbed . In the lachesis mutant , accessory cells become extra egg cells . Interestingly , it seems that the misspecification of these accessory cells results from defects in the gametic cells . This suggests that accessory cells monitor the state of the gametic cells to act as a backup if required , ensuring the formation of the key reproductive cells .   \n",

This study assessed the factors that influenced shoe wearing behaviors among people living in a rural community in highland Ethiopia . In this community , a substantial proportion of people are at risk for podoconiosis , a debilitating lower leg condition that can be prevented by wearing shoes . We conducted semi-structured individual interviews , focus group discussions and extended case studies among 242 adults and systematically analyzed the information . We found that shoe wearing is intermittent , and that different factors such as cost and ability to use the shoes for certain activities ( such as farming ) influenced consistent shoe wearing for most people . Some factors ( such as shoe size , fear of stigma ) were more relevant for podoconiosis patients . Social norms were found to be increasingly supportive of shoe wearing , and children exhibited greater desire to wear shoes than adults . These findings have relevance for preventing development and progression of a variety of NTDs in a range of settings .   \n",

These viruses enter and spread in and out of the mammalian nervous system , a defining hallmark of their lifecycle and potential pathogenesis . Neurons are polarized cells , and the movement of certain cellular proteins is highly restricted to the cell body , to dendrites , or to axons . Indeed , the axon harbors only a small subset of neuronal proteins . Thus , it is remarkable that these viruses efficiently gather and move their structural components from the cell body to the axon after infection of neurons . Previously , we identified a small viral membrane protein ( known as Us9 ) that mediates the efficient targeting of virus particles to axons of infected neurons . We now report that Us9 must localize to “lipid raft” domains , specialized regions within cellular membranes to promote axonal targeting . Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts dramatically reduces sorting of structural proteins to axons . This is the first report , to our knowledge , to implicate lipid rafts in targeting alpha herpesvirus structural proteins to axons , an essential step for spread of infection in the mammalian nervous system .   \n",

A clonal population can maximize its long-term success in an uncertain environment by diversifying its phenotypes via nongenetic heterogeneity: the currently unfavored ones may become the favored ones when conditions change . Nongenetic heterogeneity has clinical relevance . For example , populations of tumor cells or infectious microbes show cell-to-cell differences in growth and in drug or stress tolerance . This heterogeneity hampers efficient treatment and can potentiate harmful evolution of a tumor or pathogen . We show that in budding yeast , heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP levels acting through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway and its target transcription factors , Msn2 and Msn4 , underlies the nongenetic heterogeneity of both single-cell growth rate and acute heat-stress tolerance . Perturbations of this pathway significantly affect population survival upon acute heat stress . These results illuminate a mechanism of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest the potential value of antitumor or antifungal treatment strategies that target nongenetic heterogeneity to render the tumor or pathogen population more uniformly susceptible to a second drug that aims to kill .   \n",

The ability to monitor such epidemics would be enhanced by characterizing the viral populations that circulate within infected individuals . To do this , we deep-sequenced viral populations from infected individuals and identified minority variants present at high frequencies , as well as the presence of a novel 3’ untranslated genome region ( UTR ) structure , a key determinant of chikungunya virus infectivity and evolution never before described in nature . Finally , we genetically engineered an infectious clone from this outbreak strain and established that the novel 3’UTR structure increases viral replication in mosquito cells . Taken together these studies highlight the vast diversity of viral populations in infected individuals , reveal potential novel determinants of chikungunya virus biology , and provide an indispensable tool for future studies involved in viral evolution and adaptation .   \n",

The mTOR signaling pathways are essential for cell growth and clinically mis-regulation of the mTOR pathways are implicated in human diseases including tumor formation , obesity , epilepsy , autism and neurodegeneration . Here , we identify a novel gene , Ubtor as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling . Inhibiting Ubtor function promotes cell growth in neurons and cancer cells . Increasing Ubtor function reduces cancer cell growth . Functional analyses in human cells and the zebrafish model indicate Ubtor inhibits mTOR signaling by stabilizing the mTOR complex component DEPTOR , and ubtor gene disruption resulted in higher mTOR activity and aggravated cancer formation in the zebrafish . UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in xenograft-bearing mice . Thus our study provide evidence that Ubtor constitutes a novel negative feedback mechanism to control mTOR signaling and cell growth , and manipulations of Ubtor function may potentially be utilized to optimize mTOR signaling activities for treatments of cancers and other diseases .   \n",

A high-confidence network of co-complex relationships predicts the network context of 866 proteins , including many hypothetical and experimentally unannotated proteins .

However , lymph nodes are among the most frequently infected sites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) aside from the lungs . The effect of Mtb infection and how lymph nodes respond to Mtb infection is currently unknown . To investigate this , we examined the lymph nodes of two macaque species , cynomolgus and rhesus macaques , at different time points after Mtb infection . We found that overall lymph nodes are not effective killers of Mtb; the lymph nodes of rhesus macaques being less effective at killing Mtb than cynomolgus macaques . Mtb infection also resulted in the destruction of the lymph node structure and this was associated with increased bacterial burden . After a short course of anti-TB drug therapy , the reduction in bacterial burden was lower in lymph nodes compared to lung granulomas . Our data show that aside from being sites of antigen presentation and immune activation , lymph nodes are also niches of Mtb growth and persistence .   \n",

The small nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a convenient model host for studying microsporidian infections . In this work , we sample Caenorhabditis and other small nematodes and 47 associated microsporidian strains from the wild . We characterize the parasites for their position in the evolutionary tree of microsporidia and for their lifecycle and morphology . We find several new species and genera , especially some that are distantly related to the previously known Nematocida parisii and instead closely related to human pathogens . We find that some of these species have a narrow host range . We studied two species in detail using electron microscopy and uncover a new likely mode of exit from the host cell , by budding off the host cell plasma membrane rather than by fusion of a vesicle to the plasma membrane as in N . parisii . We also find a new species that infects the epidermis and muscles of Caenorhabditis rather than the host intestinal cells and is closely related to human pathogens . Finally , we find that one Nematocida species fails to elicit the same host response that other Nematocida species do . These new microsporidia open up many windows into microsporidia biology and opportunities to investigate host-parasite coevolution in the C . elegans system .   \n",
       "25                                                                             G protein coupled chemokine receptors are proteins embedded in the cell membrane . They play essential roles in the human immune system . Moreover , chemokine receptors are also involved in various diseases including cancer metastasis and HIV infection leading to AIDS . In case of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 , recent studies revealed that the proteins associate to so-called dimers , consisting of two receptors . This dimerization was shown to regulate protein function . Consequently , the association of chemokine receptors increasingly gained attention for modern drug design . However , structural information about chemokine receptor dimers is scarce due to experimental limitations . Here , we present first atomistic insight into chemokine receptor dimer structures consisting of either two equal receptors ( homodimers ) or of two different receptors ( heterodimers ) . To this end , we employed thousands of molecular dynamics simulations of the receptor association process . The simulations revealed similar homodimerization patterns for the closely related receptors CCR5 and CCR2 , and pinpointed the dimerization hotspots on both proteins . Cholesterol was found to differentiate the association patterns between CXCR4 and the related CC chemokine receptors , indicating that both heterodimerization and the interplay with cholesterol play important roles in fine-tuning chemokine-related signaling pathways .   \n",

The classical form is a full fledged disease characterized by fever , severe weight loss , enlargement of lymph organs and anemia . It renders patients very sick and is sometimes fatal . The second form , known as sub-clinical leishmaniasis , is a milder disorder . Although it presents with symptoms analogous to the ones classically associated with this infection , they are far less severe and certainly fewer in number . In this report , we are describing a third type of presentation , which is distinct from the above described . The hallmark of this third type of clinical form is depressed immunity . A number of patients suffering from repeated infections affecting various body organs and systems ( skin , respiratory , and alimentary ) were referred to us for advanced immune function testing . We were able to identify in a fraction of these patients Leishmania parasites . Upon appropriate treatment , these patients recovered . Systemic leishmaniasis was thus the culprit of their repeated episodes of falling ill . Hence our recommendation in this report is to consider the diagnosis of systemic leishmaniasis in patients suffering from signs and symptoms indicating depressed immunity ( repeated episodes of fever or infections ) .   \n",

Testing every sequence variant for association with human disease is often infeasible , as studies must be very large—and hence expensive—to overcome the statistical penalties used to control for multiple tests . A common alternative is to assay only a subset of sequence variants for which there are prior reasons to believe they may be disease-causing . Sequence variants that change conserved amino acids , for example , are often disease-causing . As an adjunct to this approach , we have explored the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying disease-causing DNA sequence variations . We find that DNA sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance , suggesting that similar functional constraints on paralogous proteins result in coordinated distributions of variants along their lengths . Moreover , if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing , its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well . These facts provide new avenues for the identification of disease-causing sequence variations .   \n",

However , whether the parasites causing severe disease differ from those causing uncomplicated disease is unknown . Several strands of evidence have suggested that parasites causing severe disease may express a restricted set of the Plasmodium falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane Protein 1 ( PfEMP1 ) proteins . PfEMP1 proteins are expressed on the surface of the infected red blood cells and elicit protective immunity . We compared the transcriptomes of parasites causing severe and uncomplicated malaria to determine whether these parasites differed in the genes they expressed . We found that the parasites causing severe malaria had altered expression of genes involved in basic metabolism , nuclear processes , and surface expression of PfEMP1 . The parasites causing severe malaria had up-regulated expression of a set of PfEMP1 proteins . Some of these PfEMP1s had been previously implicated in severe malaria , lending support to our data . Multiple associations identified between severe malaria and expressed PfEMP1 sequences were novel . These novel , severe disease–associated PfEMP1 sequences could be useful for informing design of vaccines targeting severe malaria disease .   \n",

We used recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors ( rAAV ) as gene carrier to deliver anti-SIV ( simian immunodeficiency virus ) antibodies to monkeys . This non-classical immunization approach is independent of the host immune system and the AAV-transferred gene into muscle cells produces antibodies with known specificities . Our goal was to determine what serum levels of delivered antibodies can be achieved by using two different vector strategies , whether the delivered antibodies provoke an immune response , and to what degree the delivered non-neutralizing antibodies have the ability to protect against SIV virus challenge . This approach allowed for sustained levels of delivered antibodies in serum and exhibited significant protective effects against highly pathogenic SIVmac239 challenge . However , immune responses limited the concentration of circulating antibodies that could be achieved . This problem will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized .   \n",

Motor proteins are nanometer-size devices generating forces and actively moving or rotating under the supply of chemical energy through ATP hydrolysis . They are crucial for many cell functions and promising for nanotechnology of the future . Although such motors represent single molecules , their operation cycles cannot be followed in detail in simulations even on the best modern supercomputers and some approximations need to be employed . It is often assumed that conformational dynamics of motor proteins is well described within a linear response approximation and corresponds to excitation of normal modes . We have checked this assumption for two motor proteins , myosin V and kinesin KIF1A . Our results show that , while both these biomolecules respond by well-defined motions to energetic excitations , these motions are essentially nonlinear . The effect is particularly pronounced in KIF1A where relaxation proceeds through a sequence of qualitatively different conformational changes , which may facilitate complex functional motions without additional control mechanisms .   \n",

Several endocytic pathways exist in mammalian cells . While the best understood endocytic pathway uses clathrin , recent years have seen a great increase in our understanding of clathrin-independent endocytic pathways . Here we characterize the crosstalk between caveolae , flask-shaped specialized microdomains present at the plasma membrane , and a second clathrin-independent pathway , the CLIC/GEEC Cdc42-regulated endocytic pathway . These pathways are segregated in migrating cells with caveolae at the rear and CLIC/GEEC endocytosis at the leading edge . Here we find that specific caveolar proteins , caveolins and cavins , can also negatively regulate the CLIC/GEEC pathway . With the help of several techniques , including quantitative electron microscopy analysis and real-time live-cell imaging , we demonstrate that expression of caveolar proteins affects early carrier formation , causes cellular lipid changes , and changes the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway , Cdc42 . The functional consequences of loss of caveolar proteins on the CLIC/GEEC pathway included inhibition of polarized cell migration and increased endocytosis in tissue explants .   \n",

For pathogens , these relays are key to their host survival . A typical TCS pair consists of a sensor protein , which upon an environmental stimulation will initiate a cellular response by transferring a phosphate group onto a crucial aspartate amino acid within a secondary receiver ( REC ) protein . However , more recently it has come to light that some REC proteins are missing key amino acids involved in this signaling relay process , including the aspartate residue required for the signaling relay , hinting that a subset of REC proteins might function in different ways . Here we use custom programing to extract all deposited Aspartate-Less Receivers ( ALRs ) for further examination . Surprisingly , we found that on average there are two ALRs present in every microbial species , making them a significant portion of the bacterial signaling family . Combining computational data with structural , biochemical and genetic examination of a founding member of the ALR family , Repressor of Iron Transport Regulator ( RitR ) from the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae , we demonstrate that ALRs might have evolved to accommodate more diverse environmental signals , while largely retaining their time-tested ancestral post-input signaling mechanisms .   \n",

Most OVs , particularly the oHSVs , are attenuated to varying degree . In contrast , the tropism-retargeted oHSVs are fully-virulent , highly effective oncolytic agents , and appear to be highly safe in mice . Up to now , it was unknown how efficacious the retargeted oHSVs are as immunotherapeutic agents . Here , the demonstration that they elicit local immune response and systemic therapy vaccine effects opens the possibility that the fully-virulent retargeted oHSVs may be highly efficacious oncolytic-immunotherapeutic agents .   \n",

Recombinant viral vectors are an important platform for HIV vaccine delivery . Recent clinical trials testing candidate HIV vaccines based on Ad5 vectors failed and reported excess HIV infections in some vaccine recipients , underscoring the necessity to investigate HIV susceptibility of viral vector-specific CD4 T cells in HIV vaccination . By using PBMC samples from clinical trials that examined two important HIV vaccine vectors ( canarypox viral vector ALVAC and human Ad5 vector ) , we here report that compared to Ad5 vector , the ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells are more resistant to HIV infection , providing evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T-cell populations induced by different HIV vaccine vectors . Our findings present new insights into our understanding of HIV vaccine-induced immunity and help improve the design and immune assessment of viral vectors for the development of HIV vaccines .   \n",

The particular copy of the X that is silenced nevertheless shows considerable variability among species , and the evolutionary causes for this variability remain unclear . Here , we show that X inactivation strategies are likely to evolve in response to the sex-differential fitness properties of X-linked genetic variation . Genetic variation with similar effects on male and female fitness will generally favor the evolution of random X inactivation , potentially including preferential inactivation of the maternally inherited X chromosome . Variation with opposing fitness effects in each sex ( “sexually antagonistic” variation , which includes mutations that both decrease female fitness and enhance male fitness ) selects for preferential or complete inactivation of the paternally inherited X . Paternally biased X inactivation patterns appear to be common in nature , which suggests that sexually antagonistic genetic variation might be an important factor underlying the evolution of X inactivation . The theory provides a conceptual framework for understanding the evolution of X inactivation strategies and generates several novel predictions that may soon be tested with modern genome sequencing technologies .   \n",

Human zinc-finger antiviral protein ( ZAP ) is a cellular restriction factor against many viruses but its role with regard to the flavivirus family is largely unknown . We tested the antiviral potential of ZAP against three flaviviruses and found that Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) was ZAP-sensitive , while dengue virus and Zika virus were ZAP-resistant . ZAP specifically targets JEV viral RNA and induces translation repression and RNA degradation . Our findings highlight the ZAP-mediated anti-JEV mechanisms and extend the antiviral spectrum of ZAP to include a member of the Flavivirus genus .   \n",

However , mosquitoes that are capable of transmitting RVFV have a worldwide distribution . RVF affects a broad range of animal species and is known to cause encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever in humans with survivors having long-term health effects such as a loss of vision . There is no vaccine currently approved for use in humans . In this study we evaluated the host response to infection with either a RVFV vaccine strain or a wild-type strain to identify similarities or differences that could be exploited for development of therapeutics or improved vaccines . While mice infected with the vaccine strain did not develop disease and survived , infection with the wild-type strain caused severe disease with a fatal outcome . Analyzing multiple clinical factors and the host immune response over the course of infection allowed us to identify potential host factors associated with disease progression during wild-type virus infection . This work also provides support for a current vaccine candidate , MP-12 , in demonstrating a limited and protective host response to infection .   \n",

One subtype of breast cancer is known as triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) because of lack of expression of all three receptors . TNBC is highly malignant and susceptible to developing drug resistance during chemotherapy . However , the reasons for resistance have not been well explained . We found that a secretory protein called C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) responds to taxane chemotherapy in TNBC and promotes the expression of a drug efflux pump through a specific signaling pathway ( CCL20-protein kinase Cζ [PKCζ]/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK]-nuclear factor kappa B [NF-κB]-ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 [ABCB1] ) . Increasing levels of CCL20 result in expanding breast cancer stem-like cell population and chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells . Breast cancer stem-like cells are a special population of cells with self-renewal and differentiation potential within the tumor , which are often the culprit of tumor reoccurrence , drug resistance , and metastasis . Our results suggest that blocking CCL20 or its downstream signal can significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of TNBC .   \n",

Toxoplasma’s ability to manipulate and persist in the host is due in part to its secretion of effector proteins into the host cell . Some of these effector proteins , such as GRA16 and GRA24 , must cross the vacuolar membrane that the parasite replicates within during intracellular infection to reach the host cell cytosol; however , the proteins that mediate this effector transport are largely unknown . We previously identified a cleaved protein , MYR1 , that is essential for effector transport . To identify other proteins that are involved in this process , we screened Toxoplasma mutants that are unable to induce c-Myc up-regulation in the host for their ability to transport GRA16 and GRA24 across the vacuolar membrane . Here we identify two novel proteins , MYR2 and MYR3 , that are essential for effector transport . These proteins co-localize with MYR1 in the PV space and membrane and are membrane-associated . Furthermore , MYR3 stably associates with MYR1 . These results indicate that MYR1 and MYR3 form a complex involved in the transport of key effectors .   \n",

The viral proteins E1 and E2 recognize the viral origin and initiate a process that attracts host DNA replication factors . The origin recognition complex ( ORC ) coordinates initiation of chromosome duplication . While ORC2 binds to the E2 protein , its depletion does not impair PV genome replication . Instead , depletion of ORC2 stimulates viral replication , while over-expression of E2 protein decreases ORC2 occupancy at mammalian origins . We propose that the relative abundance of E2 and ORC2 in complex regulates viral and cellular origin licensing .   \n",

The WHO classifies brucellosis as a neglected zoonosis that is rarely in the spotlight for research and mainly affects poor , marginalized people . One of the most powerful megatrends of our time is urbanization , and an often forgotten consequence of human urbanization is the urbanization of their livestock . When large concentrations of humans and livestock build up in urban areas , there is a concern that the transmission of zoonoses like brucellosis will increase . Our results indicate that Brucella DNA is widespread in dairy milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe , the capital of Tajikistan . This could constitute a public health risk because consumption of raw dairy products is common in the region . Furthermore , a discrepancy between the results of serology and PCR suggests that implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals might be warranted in Brucella control programmes .   \n",

However , differences in genome and chromosome structure are frequently found in organisms that undergo rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions , and in humans are often found in cancer cells . We study genome instability in a fungal pathogen that exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity . Regions that show extraordinary diversity in this pathogen are the transposon-rich accessory chromosomes , which contain few genes that are of unknown benefit to the organism but maintained in the population and thus considered “quasi-essential” . Accessory chromosomes in all fungi studied so far are enriched with markers for heterochromatin , namely trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 and 27 ( H3K9me3 , H3K27me3 ) . We show that loss of these heterochromatin marks has strong but opposing effects on genome stability . While loss of the transposon-associated mark H3K9me3 destabilizes the entire genome , presence of H3K27me3 favors instability of accessory chromosomes . Our study provides insight into the relationship between chromatin and genome stability and why some regions are more susceptible to genetic diversity than others .   \n",
       "43  Rapid delivery of post-exposure vaccination is essential for preventing the fatal onset of rabies in persons bitten by rabid animals . But for communities most at risk of exposure to rabies ( in resource poor countries where domestic dog rabies is still common ) , post-exposure vaccines are often not affordable and are only available in limited quantities . Several safe and effective regimens for delivery of these vaccines are recommended by WHO , but these are inconsistently implemented and there are no clear recommendations as to which is the best regimen for specific settings . We developed a framework for comparing the cost-effectiveness of different vaccination regimens , including existing approved regimens and new candidates subject to approval , in terms of costs per death averted . We demonstrate that post-exposure vaccination is an extremely cost-effective public health intervention and that changing delivery from intramuscular to intradermal vaccination has considerable benefits . Large savings in the volume of vaccine required to treat the same number of patients could potentially both mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce delays in delivery , enabling wider vaccine distribution , and thus improving the accessibility and affordability of these life-saving vaccines . We also present financing mechanisms that could help subsidize the cost for those most in need , and even support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs , without compromising existing healthcare budgets .   \n",

While the vacuole does not fuse with host organelles , the parasite scavenges nutrients , including lipids , from these compartments . Present in all mammalian cells , lipid droplets ( LD ) are dynamic structures that store neutral lipids . Whether Toxoplasma targets host LD for their nutritional content remains to be investigated . We demonstrate that the parasite relies on host LD lipids and their lipolytic enzymatic activities to grow . Toxoplasma salvages lipids from host LD , which surround the PV and , at least partially , accesses these lipids by intercepting and engulfing within the PV host Rab7-associated LD . In the PV lumen , a parasite lipase releases lipids from host LD , thus making them available to the parasite . Exogenous addition of fatty acids stimulates host LD biogenesis and results in the accumulation of enlarged LD containing neutral lipids in Toxoplasma . This study highlights the ability of Toxoplasma to scavenge and store lipids from host LD . Interestingly , exposure of Toxoplasma to excess lipids reveals , for the first time , coated invaginations of the parasite’s plasma membrane and cytoplasmic vesicles containing lipids originating from the PV lumen , potentially involved in endocytosis .   \n",

This is aggravated by the increasing number of countries reporting parasite isolates resistant to triclabendazole treatment , highlighting the urgent need to develop new agents to control fluke infections . Here , we report the discovery of chalcones that effectively inhibits key cysteine proteases essential for parasite development and survival within the host . We further characterized the mode of inhibition of the most active compound against cathepsins secreted by both adult and larval stages of the parasite . This class of compounds is generally considered safe for clinical use and we showed that the most effective derivative is not cytotoxic to bovine sperm cells . Importantly , in vitro approaches showed that it reduces host penetration and larvae viability , finally leading to parasite death . These findings point at this derivative as a good starting point for the development of novel agents to control fluke infection and possibly other helminthic diseases .   \n",

Accordingly , the amplitude and speed of this calcium signal controls the amplitude and time-course of synaptic communication . Working on the synaptic terminals of fish retinal bipolar cells , we show that the presynaptic calcium signal and the subsequent neurotransmitter release are shaped by the basic property of synapse volume . Using a combination of experimental approaches and computational models , we found that large synapses are slow and adapt little during ongoing stimulation , while small synapses are fast and show more profound adaptation . This observation leads to a second key concept: since neurons usually have several presynaptic terminals that may vary in volume , a single neuron can , in principle , forward different synaptic signals to different postsynaptic partners . We provide direct evidence that this is the case for bipolar cells of the fish retina .   \n",

Synapses are themselves highly complex and diverse signaling machines , containing protein products of hundreds of different genes , some in hundreds of copies , precisely arranged at each individual synapse . Synapses are fundamental not only to synaptic network function but also to network development , adaptation , and memory . In addition , abnormalities of synapse numbers or their molecular components have been implicated in a variety of mental and neurological disorders . Despite their obvious importance , mammalian synapse populations have so far resisted detailed quantitative study . In human brains and most animal nervous systems , synapses are very small and very densely packed: there are approximately 1 billion synapses per cubic millimeter of human cortex . This volumetric density poses very substantial challenges to proteometric analysis at the critical level of the individual synapse . The present work describes new probabilistic image analysis methods suitable for single-synapse analysis of synapse populations in both animal and human brains , in health and disorder .   \n",

ZnT2 is essential for zinc accumulation in breast milk and is therefore of paramount medical significance . Expanding on our previous study , we herein present energy calculations suggesting that ZnT2 functions as a proton/zinc antiporter . Our calculations consist of electrostatic and pKa calculations as well as zinc binding free-energy curves . Upon integration of our calculation results , we conclude that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a 2H+/Zn2+ stoichiometry , construct a Monte Carlo model to test this mode of ZnT2 transport activity , and validate our computational results experimentally using live human breast epithelial cells . These functional experiments reveal that ZnT2 cannot function in the absence of protons suggesting that it operates as a substrate-induced alternating-access transporter , displaying an apparent 2H+/Zn2+ stoichiometry .   \n",

The maintenance of stable intermediates upon stalled replication requires the coordinated action of a number of proteins and proper inhibitory control of dangerous enzymatic activities . In this study , we uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism through which 14-3-3 proteins modulate the checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation of , and in turn limit the activity of , an exonuclease ( Exo1 ) previously implicated in pathological processing of stalled replication forks and other sensitive DNA intermediates . This represents an unprecedented link in the field of DNA repair and genome stability , providing a molecular rationale to the yet undefined role of 14-3-3 proteins in the maintenance of genome integrity after replication stress . In analogy to Exo1 , our data suggest that additional factors at replication forks may be subjected to similar regulation , pointing to the 14-3-3 proteins as central components of the checkpoint triggered in response to replication stress .   \n",

Thus , persistent pDC activation has been implicated in contributing to AIDS pathogenesis . To define the role of pDC in HIV-1 infection and immunopathogenesis in vivo , we developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically and efficiently depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice . We discover that pDC are the critical IFN-I producer cells in response to acute HIV-1 infection , because depletion of pDC completely abolished induction of IFN-I or ISG by HIV-1 infection , correlated with elevated level of HIV-1 replication . When pDC were depleted during chronic HIV-1 infection in humanized mice , pDC were still the major IFN-I producing cells in vivo , which contributed to HIV-1 suppression . Despite of higher level of viral replication in pDC-depleted mice , we found that HIV-induced depletion of human T cells and leukocytes was significantly reduced in lymphoid organs , correlated with reduced cell death induction by HIV-1 infection . Our findings demonstrate that pDC play two opposing roles in HIV-1 pathogenesis: they produce IFN-I to suppress HIV-1 replication and induce death of human immune cells to contribute to HIV-induced T cell depletion and immunopathogenesis .   \n",

An increasing body of work is showing that some viruses activate and benefit from Nrf2 . In this work we tested the impact of Nrf2 on HIV . We used SFN , abundant in cruciferous vegetables and often used as a dietary supplement , to activate Nrf2 . Here we show , for the first time , that in immune cells isolated from donor blood , SFN halts HIV infection in macrophages , but not in T cells . We further show that upon SFN treatment the virus is blocked after it has transcribed its RNA-encoded genome into DNA , but before this genetic material is inserted into host chromosomes . Importantly this block is indeed dependent on Nrf2 . Interestingly , Nrf2 does not activate recognized anti-viral genes . Thus , unlike viruses recently found to benefit from Nrf2 activation , HIV can be blocked by its activation . This highlights the opportunity to activate a heretofore unrecognized anti-viral function by triggering an antioxidant response with a common dietary component .   \n",

Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to infection with malaria , but the effect on pregnancy of intestinal infections with worms is not clear and may depend both on how heavy the worm infection is and on the type of worm . Additionally , it is not clear whether infections with worms may affect malaria infections . In this article , we begin to disentangle some of these issues . Intestinal infections with worms were diagnosed in three-quarters of 390 pregnant women in western Kenya who provided a stool sample . In these women , intestinal worm infections caused a modest decrease both in haemoglobin levels and indicators of nutritional status . Women in their second and third pregnancies who were diagnosed with one particular type of worm infection ( Ascaris lumbricoides ) were less likely to have malaria than other women in their second or third pregnancies who did not have this type of worm infection . Although our results suggest that it would be good advice to treat women with drugs for intestinal worm infections during their pregnancy in this area , the effect on maternal and infant health and malaria infection needs further study .   \n",
       "53                         Mycolactone is a complex macrolidic polyketide produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans , with cytotoxic , analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties . Peripheral nerve destruction and activation of type 2 angiotensin II receptors on sensory neurons have been proposed to mediate bacteria-induced hypoesthesia in infected skin . In addition , mycolactone was recently shown to block the co-translational translocation of secretory proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum in host cells , leading to defective inflammatory responses . Here we examined if this last mechanism may also contribute to inhibit neuro-inflammation and particularly in the context of neuropathic pain . Using a representative panel of primary cells from the central and peripheral nervous systems , we found that indeed , mycolactone potently inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory mediators at non-cytotoxic concentrations . Notably , mycolactone prevented the polarization and pro-inflammatory functions of cortical microglia , which are critical inducers of neuroinflammation . Consistent with our in vitro findings , mycolactone had potent anti-inflammatory effects on the spinal cord of rats injected in the spinal canal , with no apparent side effects . Our data show that mycolactone suppresses inflammatory responses in the nervous system similarly as in the immune system , suggesting that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may , at least partially , be explained by its anti-inflammatory properties .   \n",
       "54                                           Human African Trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) known as sleeping sickness is a lethal neglected disease in West and Central Africa , caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense that is transmitted by tsetse flies Glossina palpalis gambiensis . The disease has long been considered to be invariably fatal , but field studies show that T . b . gambiense infection leads to a wide diversity of clinical outcomes . An acute form progressing rapidly to second stage; spontaneous self-cure and individuals able to control parasitaemia at very low levels ( latent infections ) . In the present study , we test for associations between candidate gene polymorphisms and different HAT phenotypes ( HAT confirmed cases , latent infections ) and endemic controls , in order to identify relationships between the clinical diversity and host genetic determinants . Our results , based on clinical , serological and parasitological observations , combined with genotypes and association analysis form the most complete study of host genetic determinants and clinical diversity of HAT in Guinea to date . We show that host genes are involved in modulating responses in Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infected individuals . A new association was found between IL6 rs1818879 and a reduced risk of progressing from latent infection to active HAT . These results constitute an important stage toward the identification of the natural human mechanisms involved in T . b . gambiense infection regulation .   \n",

A key question in the field is how DNA sequence variants impact gene expression , with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence . By contrast , the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown , owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3′ untranslated regions . In this work , we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals . Our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ gene ends , finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements , including miRNA sites . The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals , and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay . Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation .   \n",

Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design .   \n",

Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease .   \n",

Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health .   \n",

Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD .   \n",

The capacity of L . monocytogenes to escape from the phagosome and enter the host cell cytosol is paramount for the induction of long-lived CD8 T cell–mediated protective immunity . Here , we show that the impaired T cell response to L . monocytogenes confined within a phagosome is not merely a consequence of inefficient antigen presentation , but is the result of direct suppression of the adaptive response . This suppression limited not only the adaptive response to vacuole-confined L . monocytogenes , but negated the response to bacteria within the cytosol . Co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic L . monocytogenes prevented the generation of acquired immunity and limited expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to the cytosolic L . monocytogenes strain alone . Bacteria confined to a phagosome suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and led to the rapid MyD88-dependent production of IL-10 . Blockade of the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88 during primary infection restored protective immunity . Our studies demonstrate that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells .   \n",

Primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) is the most common subtype and is a complex trait with multigenic inheritance . Genome-wide association studies have previously identified a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 locus ( rs10483727 , odds ratio ( OR ) = 1 . 32 , p = 3 . 87×10−11 ) . SIX6 plays a role in ocular development and has been associated with the morphology of the optic nerve . We sequenced the SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls and identified six nonsynonymous coding variants , including five rare and one common variant , Asn141His ( rs33912345 ) , which was associated significantly with POAG ( OR = 1 . 27 , p = 4 . 2×10−10 ) in the NEIGHBOR/GLAUGEN datasets . These variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio ( zebrafish ) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure . Five variants , found primarily in POAG cases , were hypomorphic or null , while the sixth variant , found only in controls , was benign . One variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation . Finally , to our knowledge for the first time , we have identified a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent upon SIX6 genotype: patients who are homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele ( His141 ) have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele ( Asn141 ) . Our results , in combination with previous SIX6 work , lead us to hypothesize that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina , leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells , thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss .   \n",

Flagellar gene expression also indirectly impacts production of the glucosylating toxins , which are essential to diarrheal disease development . Thus , factors that regulate the expression of the flgB operon will likely impact toxin production in addition to flagellar motility . Here , we report the identification a “flagellar switch” that controls the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins . The flagellar switch , located upstream of the flgB operon containing the early stage flagellar genes , is a 154 bp invertible sequence flanked by 21 bp inverted repeats . Bacteria with the sequence in one orientation expressed flagellum and toxin genes , produced flagella , and secreted the toxins ( “flg phase ON” ) . Bacteria with the sequence in the inverse orientation were attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression , were aflagellate , and showed decreased toxin secretion ( “flg phase OFF” ) . The orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro . We provide evidence that gene regulation via the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation and requires a C . difficile-specific regulatory factor to destabilize or degrade the early flagellar gene mRNA when the flagellar switch is in the OFF orientation . Lastly , through mutagenesis and characterization of flagellar phase locked isolates , we determined that the tyrosine recombinase RecV , which catalyzes inversion at the cwpV switch , is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions . Phase variable flagellar motility and toxin production suggests that these important virulence factors have both advantageous and detrimental effects during the course of infection .   \n",

In the model organism Bacillus subtilis , gene expression in the forespore and in the mother cell , the two cells that participate in endospore development , is governed by cell type-specific RNA polymerase sigma subunits . σF in the forespore , and σE in the mother cell control early stages of development and are replaced , at later stages , by σG and σK , respectively . Starting with σF , the activation of the sigma factors is sequential , requires the preceding factor , and involves cell-cell signaling pathways that operate at key morphological stages . Here , we have studied the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors in the intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile , an obligate anaerobe in which the endospores are central to the infectious cycle . The morphological characterization of mutants for the sporulation sigma factors , in parallel with use of a fluorescence reporter for single cell analysis of gene expression , unraveled important deviations from the B . subtilis paradigm . While the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved , we show that the activity of σE is partially independent of σF , that σG activity is not dependent on σE , and that the activity of σK does not require σG . We also show that σK is not strictly required for heat resistant spore formation . In all , our results indicate reduced temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors , and reduced requirement for the σF-to-σE , σE-to-σG , and σG-to-σK cell-cell signaling pathways . Nevertheless , our results support the view that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution , with the sigma factors acting as the key regulators of the pathway , established some 2 . 5 billion years ago upon its emergence at the base of the Firmicutes Phylum .   \n",

This reduction can closely replicate the steady state behavior of detailed multisite systems such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model or rule-based models . Optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when the activation of an allosteric protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant . The reduction makes this framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications , where several multisite proteins may interact simultaneously . As an application we analyze a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast , which has been proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth . We show that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch . In particular , this system incorporates a signal proportional to bud growth or size , a mechanism to read the signal , and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating that sufficient growth has occurred .   \n",

While genetic “switching” phenomena are a common feature , their mechanistic underpinnings have remained elusive . The interplay between circuit components and their regulation are intertwined and embedded . Observable phenotypes are complex and context dependent . We employed a combination of experimental work and mathematical models to decipher network connectivity and signal transduction in the autoinducer-2 ( AI-2 ) quorum sensing system of E . coli . Negative and positive feedback mechanisms were examined by separating the network architecture into sub-networks . A new unreported negative feedback interaction was hypothesized and tested via a simple mathematical model . Also , the importance of the LsrR regulator and its determinant role in the E . coli QS “switch” , normally masked by interfering regulatory loops , were revealed . Our simple model allowed mechanistic understanding of the interplay among regulatory sub-structures and their contributions to the overall native functioning network . This “bottom up” approach in understanding gene regulation will serve to unravel complex QS network architectures and lead to the directed coordination of emergent behaviors .   \n",

Although the effect of helminths on malaria infection is evident , the impact of these co-infections is not clearly elucidated yet and the scarce findings are conflicting . In this study , we investigated the effect of schistosomiasis , considering soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ) , on prevalence and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection . This longitudinal survey was conducted in school-age children living in two rural communities in the vicinity of Lambaréné , Gabon . Thick blood smear light microscopy , urine filtration and the Kato-Katz technique were performed to detect malaria parasites , S . haematobium eggs and , STH eggs , respectively . P . falciparum carriage was assessed at inclusion , and incidence of malaria and time to the first malaria event were recorded in correlation with Schistosoma carriage status . Stratified multivariate analysis using generalized linear model was used to assess the risk of plasmodium infection considering interaction with STH , and survival analysis to assess time to malaria . The overall prevalence on subject enrolment was 30% , 23% and 9% for S . haematobium , P . falciparum infections and co-infection with both parasites , respectively . Our results showed that schistosomiasis in children tends to increase the risk of plasmodium infection but a combined effect with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection clearly increase the risk ( aOR = 3 . 9 [95%CI: 1 . 7–9 . 2] ) . The incidence of malaria over time was 0 . 51[95%CI: 0 . 45–0 . 57] per person-year and was higher in the Schistosoma-infected group compared to the non-infected group ( 0 . 61 vs 0 . 43 , p = 0 . 02 ) , with a significant delay of time-to first-malaria event only in children aged from 6 to 10-years-old infected with Schistosoma haematobium . Our results suggest that STH enhance the risk for P . falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children , and when infected , that schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children .   \n",

Following experimental Leishmania donovani infection , the inflammatory response is mainly induced by the transcription factor IRF-5 . IRF-5 is responsible for the activation of several genes encoding key pro-inflammatory cytokines , such as IL-6 and TNF . Here , we investigate the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses during L . donovani infection . Our data demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced by IRF-5 limits CD8+ T cell expansion and induces HIF-1α in dendritic cells . Ablation of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells resulted into a higher frequency of short-lived effector cells ( SLEC ) , enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion , and increased IL-12 expression by splenic DCs . Moreover , mice with a targeted depletion of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells had a significantly lower splenic parasite burden , suggesting that induction of HIF-1α may represent an immune evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections .   \n",

This systematic review brings together information reported in studies conducted in Latin America , on the potential predictors of adverse prognosis ( continued evolution of the initial clinical conditions of the patient despite the implementation of treatment , independent of the occurrence of death ) and death from VL . The limitations of the existing knowledge , the advances achieved and the approaches to be used in future research are presented . The full texts of 14 studies conforming to the inclusion criteria were analyzed and their methodological quality examined by means of a tool developed in the light of current research tools . Information regarding prognostic variables was synthesized using meta-analysis . Variables were grouped according to the strength of evidence considering summary measures , patterns and heterogeneity of effect-sizes , and the results of multivariate analyses . The strongest predictors identified in this review were jaundice , thrombocytopenia , hemorrhage , HIV coinfection , diarrhea , age <5 and age >40–50 years , severe neutropenia , dyspnoea and bacterial infections . Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes . The main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far . Integration of the results from different investigations conducted over the last 10 years enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables that could be useful in recognizing and handling VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes . The development of externally validated prognostic models must be prioritized in future investigations .   \n",
       "14                 In Algeria , the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmanioses ( VL and CL ) has been and continues to be based on antimony-containing drugs . It is suspected that high drug selective pressure might favor the emergence of chemoresistant parasites . Although treatment failure is frequently reported during antimonial therapy of both CL and VL , antimonial resistance has never been thoroughly investigated in Algeria . Determining the level of antimonial susceptibility , amongst Leishmania transmitted in Algeria , is of great importance for the development of public health policies . Within the framework of the knowledge about the epidemiology of VL and CL amassed during the last 30 years , we sampled Leishmania isolates to determine their susceptibility to antimony . We analyzed a total of 106 isolates including 88 isolates collected between 1976 and 2013 in Algeria from humans , dogs , rodents , and phlebotomines and 18 collected from dogs in France . All the Algerian isolates were collected in 14 localities where leishmaniasis is endemic . The 50% inhibitory concentrations ( IC50 ) of potassium antimony tartrate ( the trivalent form of antimony , Sb ( III ) ) and sodium stibogluconate ( the pentavalent form of antimony , Sb ( V ) ) were determined in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes , respectively . The epidemiological cutoff ( ECOFF ) that allowed us to differentiate between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniases that were susceptible ( S+ ) or insusceptible ( S- ) to the trivalent form of antimony was determined . The computed IC50 cutoff values were 23 . 83 μg/mL and 15 . 91 μg/mL for VL and CL , respectively . We report a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in VL isolates during the 30-year period . In contrast , an increase in the frequency of S- phenotypes in isolates causing CL was observed during the same period . In our study , the emergence of S- phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of L . killicki ( syn: L . tropica ) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and that have emerged in Algeria during the last decade . Our results provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria . We highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains .   \n",

Exposure to foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis produces a long-term risk of CD well into the post-infectious period but the mechanistic basis for this ongoing relationship to disease onset is unknown . We developed two novel models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli ( AIEC ) , a bacterial pathobiont linked to CD . Here , we show that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont , with an attendant increase in immunopathology , barrier defects , and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance . These features required AIEC resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen . Our results suggest that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset . Importantly , our data identify AIEC as a tractable disease modifier , a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals .   \n",

The female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells , the egg cell and the central cell , which are flanked by five accessory cells . Both gametic and accessory cells are vital for fertilization; however , the mechanisms that underlie the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate are unknown . In a screen for regulators of egg cell fate , we isolated the lachesis ( lis ) mutant which forms supernumerary egg cells . In lis mutants , accessory cells differentiate gametic cell fate , indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate . The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells . LIS is homologous to the yeast splicing factor PRP4 , indicating that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions .   \n",

Better understanding of the behaviors that influence use of footwear will lead to improved ability to measure shoe use and will be important for those implementing footwear programs . Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model we assessed social , behavioral , environmental , educational and ecological needs influencing whether and when children wear shoes in a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis . Information was gathered from 242 respondents using focus groups , semi-structured interviews and extended case studies . Shoe-wearing norms were said to be changing , with going barefoot increasingly seen as ‘shameful’ . Shoes were thought to confer dignity as well as protection against injury and cold . However , many practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice . Limited financial resources meant that people were neither able to purchase more than one pair of shoes to ensure their longevity nor afford shoes of the preferred quality . As a result of this limited access , shoes were typically preserved for special occasions and might not be provided for children until they reached a certain age . While some barriers ( for example fit of shoe and fear of labeling through use of a certain type of shoe ) may be applicable only to certain diseases , underlying structural level barriers related to poverty ( for example price , quality , unsuitability for daily activities and low risk perception ) are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs . Using well established conceptual models of health behavior adoption , we identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are amenable to intervention and which we anticipate will be of benefit to those considering NTD prevention through shoe distribution .   \n",

As a result , Us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection in vivo . However , it is unclear how Us9 promotes axonal sorting of so many viral proteins . It is known that the glycoproteins gB , gC , gD and gE are associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes , and are directed into the axon in a Us9-dependent manner . In this report , we determined that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts , and that this association is critical to Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins . We used infected non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells , a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires many of the characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor ( NGF ) . In these cells , Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes ( DRMs ) . Moreover , reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro . We conclude that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and , as a consequence , for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system .   \n",
       "19  Genetically identical cells exhibit extensive phenotypic variation even under constant and benign conditions . This so-called nongenetic heterogeneity has important clinical implications: within tumors and microbial infections , cells show nongenetic heterogeneity in growth rate and in susceptibility to drugs or stress . The budding yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , shows a similar form of nongenetic heterogeneity in which growth rate correlates positively with susceptibility to acute heat stress at the single-cell level . Using genetic and chemical perturbations , combined with high-throughput single-cell assays of yeast growth and gene expression , we show here that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) levels acting through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway and its target transcription factors , Msn2 and Msn4 , underlies this nongenetic heterogeneity . Lower levels of cAMP correspond to slower growth , as shown by direct comparison of cAMP concentration in subpopulations enriched for slower vs . faster growing cells . Concordantly , an endogenous reporter of this pathway’s activity correlates with growth in individual cells . The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity in a way that demonstrates slow growth and stress tolerance are not inevitably linked . Heterogeneity in growth rate requires each , whereas only Msn2 is required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl1 , a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance . Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway , or by culturing wild-type cells with the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP or the PKA inhibitor H89 , significantly impacts survival of acute heat stress . Perturbations that increase intracellular cAMP levels reduce the slower-growing subpopulation and increase susceptibility to acute heat stress , whereas PKA inhibition slows growth and decreases susceptibility to acute heat stress . Loss of Msn2 reduces , but does not completely eliminate , the correlation in individual cells between growth rate and acute-stress survival , suggesting a major role for the Msn2 pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity but also a residual benefit of slow growth . Our results shed light on the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment .   \n",

In December of 2013 the Asian Lineage of CHIKV spread from the Old World to the Americas , spreading rapidly throughout the New World . Given this new emergence in naïve populations we studied the viral genetic diversity present in infected individuals to understand how CHIKV may have evolved during this continuing outbreak . We used deep-sequencing technologies coupled with well-established bioinformatics pipelines to characterize the minority variants and diversity present in CHIKV infected individuals from Guadeloupe and Martinique , two islands in the center of the epidemic . We observed changes in the consensus sequence as well as a diverse range of minority variants present at various levels in the population . Furthermore , we found that overall diversity was dramatically reduced after single passages in cell lines . Finally , we constructed an infectious clone from this outbreak and identified a novel 3’ untranslated region ( UTR ) structure , not previously found in nature , that led to increased replication in insect cells . Here we preformed an intrahost quasispecies analysis of the new CHIKV outbreak in the Caribbean . We identified novel variants present in infected individuals , as well as a new 3’UTR structure , suggesting that CHIKV has rapidly evolved in a short period of time once it entered this naïve population . These studies highlight the need to continue viral diversity surveillance over time as this epidemic evolves in order to understand the evolutionary potential of CHIKV .   \n",

Here , we identify UBTOR , a previously unannotated gene as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling . Reduction of UBTOR function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth . UBTOR depletion activates mTOR signaling and promotes cell growth , whilst UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines . Studies in cultured cells and zebrafish model show that UBTOR inhibits mTOR signaling by stabilizing the mTOR complex component DEPTOR , and ubtor gene disruption result in higher mTOR activity and aggravate HRAS ( G12V ) induced neoplasia in the zebrafish .

While protein-protein interactions are highly informative about protein function , a global map of protein interactions and complexes is still lacking for these important human parasites . Here , benefiting from in-depth biochemical fractionation , we systematically interrogated the co-complex interactions of more than 3354 protein groups in procyclic life stage of Trypanosoma brucei , the protozoan parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis . Using a rigorous methodology , our analysis led to identification of 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 protein groups , including 635 protein groups that lacked experimental annotation . These complexes correlate well with known pathways as well as for proteins co-expressed across the T . brucei life cycle , and provide potential functions for a large number of previously uncharacterized proteins . We validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery , identifying a candidate potentially involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T . brucei . Our data provide an unprecedented view of the protein complex map of T . brucei , and serve as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins .

Even though lymph nodes ( LN ) are among the most common sites of extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection , and thoracic LNs are frequently infected in humans , bacterial dynamics and the effect of Mtb infection in LN structure and function is relatively unstudied . We surveyed thoracic LNs from Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques analyzing PET CT scans , bacterial burden , LN structure and immune function . FDG avidity correlated with the presence of live bacteria in LNs at necropsy . Lymph nodes have different trajectories ( increasing , maintaining , decreasing in PET activity over time ) even within the same animal . Rhesus macaques are more susceptible to Mtb infection than cynomolgus macaques and this is in part due to more extensive LN pathology . Here , we show that Mtb grows to the same level in cynomolgus and rhesus macaque LNs , however , cynomolgus macaques control Mtb at later time points post-infection while rhesus macaques do not . Notably , compared to lung granulomas , LNs are generally poor at killing Mtb , even with drug treatment . Granulomas that form in LNs lack B cell-rich tertiary lymphoid structures , disrupt LN structure by pushing out T cells and B cells , introduce large numbers of macrophages that can serve as niches for Mtb , and destroy normal vasculature . Our data support that LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection , but also serve as important sites for persistence of significant numbers of Mtb bacilli .   \n",

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently become a model host for studying microsporidia through the identification of its natural microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii . However , it was unclear how widespread and diverse microsporidia infections are in C . elegans or other related nematodes in the wild . Here we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections . N . parisii is found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C . elegans in the wild . In addition , we further describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus . Our sampling and phylogenetic analysis further identify two subclades that are genetically distinct from Nematocida , and we name them Enteropsectra and Pancytospora . Interestingly , unlike Nematocida , these two genera belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens . All of these microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells , except Pancytospora epiphaga that replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host . At the subcellular level in the infected host cell , spores of the novel genus Enteropsectra show a characteristic apical distribution and exit via budding off of the plasma membrane , instead of exiting via exocytosis as spores of Nematocida . Host specificity is broad for some microsporidia , narrow for others: indeed , some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp . 3 , and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp . 3 do not infect O . tipulae . We also show that N . ausubeli fails to strongly induce in C . elegans the transcription of genes that are induced by other Nematocida species , suggesting it has evolved mechanisms to prevent induction of this host response . Altogether , these newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes , and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts .   \n",

A plethora of studies show that homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 modulate receptor function . In addition , membrane cholesterol affects chemokine receptor activity . However , structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interplay with cholesterol is limited . Here , we report homo- and heterodimer configurations of the chemokine receptors CXCR4 , CCR5 , and CCR2 at atomistic detail , as obtained from thousands of molecular dynamics simulations . The observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related CC chemokine receptors , yet they differed significantly between the CC receptors and CXCR4 . Despite their high sequence identity , cholesterol modulated the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner . Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2 . Furthermore , associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns . This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs .   \n",

Beside this classical form , a sub-clinical form has been identified . It is described with either one or two of the above symptoms missing; other findings have been reported instead , such as lymphadenopathy and anemia . In this report , we reveal a third unsuspected form which we are referring to as “atypical” . Patients suspected to be immune-deficient were referred to our immunology specialized laboratory to study some aspects of their immune functions ( not normally covered in the general laboratory ) . Multiple specialized tests were performed , including microscopic examinations using appropriate stains , and mainly cultures of biopsies on several types of specialized media . 19·4% of 160 patients were found to have close to normal laboratory profiles , but exhibited dysfunctional macrophages laden with Leishmania parasites . Findings such as the ones we obtained allowed us to uncover the presence of patients with an atypical form of systemic leishmaniasis . It presents with symptoms masquarading a condition in which the immune system is non functional . This predisposes patients to recurrent secondary infections resulting in clinical pictures with a great variety of signs and symptoms . These findings alerted us to the fact that systemic leishmaniasis presents with a much wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than so far suspected and is far more common than diagnosed to date . Furthermore , among these 31 patients was a number of adults . This proved that in our area systemic leishmaniasis is surely not limited to the pediatric age group . Our recommendation is to entertain the diagnosis of atypical systemic leishmaniasis in any patient with an unexplained depressed immunity state and in whom no obvious immunologic defect can be identified .   \n",

However , predicting the phenotypic consequences and eventual clinical significance of a sequence variant is not an easy task . Computational approaches have found perturbation of conserved amino acids to be a useful criterion for identifying variants likely to have phenotypic consequences . To our knowledge , however , no study to date has explored the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences . In order to investigate the potential of this approach , we have assembled a unique collection of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and the Human Genome Mutation Database ( HGMD ) and used them to identify and characterize pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins . Our analyses demonstrate that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins . Moreover , if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing , its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well . Thus , information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants , extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization , and provide a suite of candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes .   \n",

The host environment changes dramatically in severe malaria , but the extent to which the parasite responds to—or is selected by—this environment remains unclear . From previous studies , the parasites that cause severe malaria appear to increase expression of a restricted but poorly defined subset of the PfEMP1 variant , surface antigens . PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity . Here , we used RNA sequencing ( RNAseq ) to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients . The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins . Our RNAseq also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts , domains , and smaller sequence segments and also confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease . These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and also indicate how parasites adapt to—or are selected by—the host environment in severe malaria .   \n",

We used AAV vector intramuscularly to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) in IgG1 form to rhesus monkeys . Persisting levels of delivered mAb as high as 270 μg/ml were achieved . However , host antibody responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys and these appeared to limit the concentration of delivered antibody that could be achieved . This is reflected in the wide range of delivered mAb concentrations that were achieved: 1–270 μg/ml . Following repeated , marginal dose , intravenous challenge with the difficult-to-neutralize SIVmac239 , the six monkeys in the AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb group showed clear protective effects despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge virus . The protective effects included: lowering of viral load at peak height; lowering of viral load at set point; delay in the time to peak viral load from the time of the infectious virus exposure . All of these effects were statistically significant . In addition , the monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb completely resisted six successive SIVmac239 i . v . challenges , including a final challenge with a dose of 10 i . v . infectious units . Our results demonstrate the continued promise of this approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in people . However , the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized .   \n",

Conformational motions in proteins are traditionally analyzed in terms of normal modes and experimental data on thermal fluctuations in such macromolecules is also usually interpreted in terms of the excitation of normal modes . We have chosen two important protein motors — myosin V and kinesin KIF1A — and performed numerical investigations of their conformational relaxation properties within the coarse-grained elastic network approximation . We have found that the linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations . The deficiency is particularly pronounced in KIF1A where the normal mode description fails completely in describing functional mechanochemical motions . These results indicate that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered . Neither a single normal mode nor a superposition of such modes yields an approximation of strongly nonlinear dynamics .   \n",

However , the molecular mechanisms and functional relevance of these interactions are unclear . Caveolins and cavins are crucial components of caveolae , specialized microdomains that also constitute an endocytic route . Here we show that specific caveolar proteins are independently acting negative regulators of clathrin-independent endocytosis . Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 , but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4 , are potent inhibitors of the clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment ( CLIC/GEEC ) endocytic pathway , in a process independent of caveola formation . Caveolin-1 ( CAV1 ) and CAV3 also inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon over-expression . Expression of caveolar protein leads to reduction in formation of early CLIC/GEEC carriers , as detected by quantitative electron microscopy analysis . Furthermore , the CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV1/Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 . Inhibition by caveolins can be mimicked by the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and is associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid microdomain components , as revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) studies . In the absence of cavins ( and caveolae ) CAV1 is itself endocytosed preferentially through the CLIC/GEEC pathway , but the pathway loses polarization and sorting attributes with consequences for membrane dynamics and endocytic polarization in migrating cells and adult muscle tissue . We also found that noncaveolar Cavin-1 can act as a modulator for the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway , Cdc42 . This work provides new insights into the regulation of noncaveolar clathrin-independent endocytosis by specific caveolar proteins , illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between these pathways . We show for the first time a role for specific cavins in regulating the CLIC/GEEC pathway , provide a new tool to study this pathway , identify caveola-independent functions of the cavins and propose a novel mechanism for inhibition of the CLIC/GEEC pathway by caveolin .   \n",

To propagate a signaling response the typical system employs a sensory histidine kinase that phosphorylates a Receiver ( REC ) domain on a conserved aspartate ( Asp ) residue . Although it is known that some REC domains are missing this Asp residue , it remains unclear as to how many of these divergent REC domains exist , what their functional roles are and how they are regulated in the absence of the conserved Asp . Here we have compiled all deposited REC domains missing their phosphorylatable Asp residue , renamed here as the Aspartate-Less Receiver ( ALR ) domains . Our data show that ALRs are surprisingly common and are enriched for when attached to more rare effector outputs . Analysis of our informatics and the available ALR atomic structures , combined with structural , biochemical and genetic data of the ALR archetype RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae presented here suggest that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to instead take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation , while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface . This work defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains .   \n",

Most of them gain cancer-specificity from deletions/mutations in genes that counteract the host response , and grow selectively in cancer cells defective in anti-viral response . Because of the deletions/mutations , they are frequently attenuated or over-attenuated . We developed next-generation oHSVs , which carry no deletion/mutation , gain cancer-specificity from specific retargeting to tumor cell receptors—e . g . HER2 ( human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ) —hence are fully-virulent in the targeted cancer cells . The type of immunotherapy they elicit was not predictable , since non-attenuated HSVs induce and then dampen the innate response , whereas deleted/attenuated viruses fail to contrast it , and since the retargeted oHSVs replicate efficiently in tumor cells , but spare other cells in the tumor . We report on the first efficacy study of HER2-retargeted , fully-virulent oHSVs in immunocompetent mice . Their safety profile was very high . Both the unarmed R-LM113 and the IL-12-armed R-115 inhibited the growth of the primary HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma-1 ( HER2-LLC1 ) tumor , R-115 being constantly more efficacious . All the mice that did not die because of the primary treated tumors , were protected from the growth of contralateral untreated tumors . The long-term survivors were protected from a second contralateral tumor , providing additional evidence for an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect . Analysis of the local response highlighted that particularly R-115 unleashed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment , i . e . induced immunomodulatory cytokines , including IFNγ , T-bet which promoted Th1 polarization . Some of the tumor infiltrating cells , e . g . CD4+ , CD335+ cells were increased in the tumors of all responders mice , irrespective of which virus was employed , whereas CD8+ , Foxp3+ , CD141+ were increased and CD11b+ cells were decreased preferentially in R-115-treated mice . The durable response included a breakage of tolerance towards both HER2 and the wt tumor cells , and underscored a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine response .   \n",

Our recent study reported that human Ad5-specific CD4 T cells induced by Ad5 vaccination ( RV156A trial ) are susceptible to HIV . Here we further investigated the HIV susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by ALVAC , a canarypox viral vector tested in the Thai trial RV144 , as compared to Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells in the HVTN204 trial . We showed that while Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells were readily susceptible to HIV , ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro . The lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells was associated with the reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells . Phenotypic analyses identified that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype , producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 ( MIP-1β ) but little IL-17 . Of interest , ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs . CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in PBMC , with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation , while Ad5 vector induced CD4 T-cell proliferation . Depletion of ALVAC- , but not Ad5- , induced CD8 T cells in PBMC led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells , suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV . Taken together , our data provide strong evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination .   \n",

X inactivation strategies can range from strict paternally inherited X inactivation ( PXI ) , which renders females haploid for all maternally inherited alleles , to unbiased random X inactivation ( RXI ) , which equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each female tissue . However , the underlying evolutionary processes that might account for this observed diversity of X inactivation strategies remain unclear . We present a theoretical population genetic analysis of X inactivation evolution and specifically consider how conditions of dominance , linkage , recombination , and sex-differential selection each influence evolutionary trajectories of X inactivation . The results indicate that a single , critical interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad and continuous range of X inactivation strategies , including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes . RXI is favored over complete PXI as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive , and the criteria for RXI evolution is considerably more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic ( i . e . , alleles deleterious to females are beneficial to males ) relative to variation that is deleterious to both sexes . Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI also generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness . These results provide a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and lead to several useful predictions that could motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation .   \n",

So far , only one flavivirus , yellow fever virus , has been reported to be ZAP-resistant . Here , we investigated the antiviral potential of human ZAP ( isoform ZAP-L and ZAP-S ) against three flaviviruses , Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) , dengue virus ( DENV ) and Zika virus ( ZIKV ) . Infection of JEV but not DENV or ZIKV was blocked by ZAP overexpression , and depletion of endogenous ZAP enhanced JEV replication . ZAP hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3′-5′ RNA exosome-mediated degradation . The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity . JEV 3′-UTR , especially in the region with dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucleotide , was mapped to bind ZAP and confer sensitivity to ZAP . In summary , we identified JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus . ZAP may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight against JEV infection .   \n",

RVFV is endemic to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula , but there is significant concern regarding its introduction into non-endemic regions and the potentially devastating effect to livestock populations with concurrent infections of humans . To date , there is little detailed data directly comparing the host response to infection with wild-type or vaccine strains of RVFV and correlation with viral pathogenesis . Here we characterized clinical and systemic immune responses to infection with wild-type strain ZH501 or IND vaccine strain MP-12 in the C57BL/6 mouse . Animals infected with live-attenuated MP-12 survived productive viral infection with little evidence of clinical disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues . In contrast , ZH501 infection was lethal , caused depletion of lymphocytes and platelets and elicited a strong , systemic cytokine response which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology . Lymphopenia and platelet depletion were indicators of disease onset with indications of lymphocyte recovery correlating with increases in G-CSF production . RVFV is hepatotropic and in these studies significant clinical and histological data supported these findings; however , significant evidence of a pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent . Rather , viral infection resulted in a chemokine response indicating infiltration of immunoreactive cells , such as neutrophils , which was supported by histological data . In brains of ZH501 infected mice , a significant chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident , but with little pathology indicating meningoencephalitis . These data suggest that RVFV pathogenesis in mice is associated with a loss of liver function due to liver necrosis and hepatitis yet the long-term course of disease for those that might survive the initial hepatitis is neurologic in nature which is supported by observations of human disease and the BALB/c mouse model .   \n",

The mechanisms of taxane chemoresistance in TNBC have not been well investigated . Our results illustrated C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) was significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response . Furthermore , CCL20 promoted the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells ( BCSCs ) or breast cancer stem-like cells through protein kinase Cζ ( PKCζ ) or p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) -mediated activation of p65 nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) pathway , significantly increasing the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs . Moreover , CCL20-promoted NF-κB activation increased ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 ( ABCB1 ) /multidrug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) expression , leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane . These results suggested that chemotherapy-induced CCL20 mediated chemoresistance via up-regulating ABCB1 . In addition , NF-κB activation increased CCL20 expression , forming a positive feedback loop between NF-κB and CCL20 pathways , which provides sustained impetus for chemoresistance in breast cancer cells . Our results suggest that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response , and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream pathway might reverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients .   \n",

The ability of Toxoplasma tachyzoites to infect and successfully manipulate its host is dependent on its ability to transport “GRA” proteins that originate in unique secretory organelles called dense granules into the host cell in which they reside . GRAs have diverse roles in Toxoplasma’s intracellular lifecycle , including co-opting crucial host cell functions and proteins , such as the cell cycle , c-Myc and p38 MAP kinase . Some of these GRA proteins , such as GRA16 and GRA24 , are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole ( PV ) within which Toxoplasma replicates and are transported across the PV membrane ( PVM ) into the host cell , but the translocation process and its machinery are not well understood . We previously showed that TgMYR1 , which is cleaved by TgASP5 into two fragments , localizes to the PVM and is essential for GRA transport into the host cell . To identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport , we screened Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus . Here we report that novel proteins MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell . MYR2 and MYR3 are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1 . Consistent with their predicted transmembrane domains , all three proteins are membrane-associated , and MYR3 , but not MYR2 , stably associates with MYR1 , whose N- and C-terminal fragments are disulfide-linked . We further show that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors , consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport . Overall , these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell .   \n",

As a nuclear double stranded DNA plasmid , the papillomavirus ( PV ) genome resembles a mini-chromosome in infected cells . To initiate its replication , the viral E2 protein binds to and recruits the E1 DNA helicase at the viral origin . PV genome replication program exhibits three stages: initial amplification from a single genome upon infection to a few copies per cell , a cell cycle linked maintenance phase , and a differentiation dependent late stage where the genome is amplified to thousands of copies . Involvement of ORC or other pre-replication complex ( pre-RC ) factors has not been described . We report that human PV ( HPV ) and bovine PV ( BPV-1 ) E2 proteins bind to ORC2 , however , ORC2 was not detected at the viral origin . Depletion of ORC2 enhanced PV replication in a transient replication model and in keratinocytes stably maintaining viral episomes , while there was no effect on copy number in a cell line with integrated HPV genomes . Consistent with this , occupancy of E1 and E2 at the viral origin increased following ORC2 silencing . These data imply that ORC2 is not necessary for activation of the PV origin by E1 and E2 but instead suppresses E2 replicative function . Furthermore , we observed that over-expression of HPV E2 decreased ORC2 occupation at two known mammalian origins of replication , suggesting that E2 restricts pre-ORC assembly that could otherwise compete for host replication complexes necessary for viral genome amplification . We infer that the ORC2 complex with E2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral replication program and that elevated levels of E2 that occur during the differentiation dependent amplification stage subvert ORC loading and hence DNA synthesis at cellular origins .   \n",

The World Health Organization classifies brucellosis as a neglected zoonotic disease that is rarely in the spotlight for research and mainly affects poor , marginalized people . Urban and peri-urban farming is a common practice in many low-income countries , and it increases the incomes of families that are often restrained by limited economic resources . However , there is a concern that the growing number of people and livestock living close together in these areas will increase the transmission of zoonotic pathogens such as Brucella . This study investigates the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe , Tajikistan . Brucella DNA was detected in 10 . 3% of 564 cow milk samples by IS711-based real-time PCR . This finding is concerning because consumption of unpasteurized dairy products is common in the region . Furthermore , Brucella DNA was detected in the milk of all seropositive cows , but 8 . 3% of the seronegative cows also showed the presence of Brucella DNA . In addition , sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggests that one cow was infected with B . abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B . melitensis . The discrepancies between the serology and real-time PCR results highlight the need to further investigate whether there is a need for implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance , control , and eradication programmes . Furthermore , vaccination of cattle with S19 in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1 might be needed in order to control Brucella infections in the livestock population but further research focusing on the isolation of Brucella is required to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the Brucella spp . circulating among the livestock in this region .   \n",

Many organisms maintain supernumerary or accessory chromosomes that deviate from standard chromosomes . The pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici has as many as eight accessory chromosomes , which are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis , transcriptionally repressed , show enrichment of repetitive elements , and enrichment with heterochromatic histone methylation marks , e . g . , trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 or lysine 27 ( H3K9me3 , H3K27me3 ) . To elucidate the role of heterochromatin on genome stability in Z . tritici , we deleted the genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 , kmt1 and kmt6 , respectively , and generated a double mutant . We combined experimental evolution and genomic analyses to determine the impact of these deletions on chromosome and genome stability , both in vitro and in planta . We used whole genome sequencing , ChIP-seq , and RNA-seq to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure , and differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains . Analyses of genome and ChIP-seq data in H3K9me3-deficient strains revealed dramatic chromatin reorganization , where H3K27me3 is mostly relocalized into regions that are enriched with H3K9me3 in wild type . Many genome rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes were found in the absence of H3K9me3 , accompanied by activation of transposable elements . In stark contrast , loss of H3K27me3 actually increased the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions in vitro , even without large scale changes in gene activity . We conclude that H3K9me3 is important for the maintenance of genome stability because it disallows H3K27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin . In this system , H3K27me3 reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes , generating a “metastable” state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome .   \n",

Unfortunately , life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals are often neither accessible nor affordable , particularly to the poorest sectors of society who are most at risk and upon whom the largest burden of rabies falls . Increasing accessibility , reducing costs and preventing delays in delivery of PEP should therefore be prioritized . We analyzed different PEP vaccination regimens and evaluated their relative costs and benefits to bite victims and healthcare providers . We found PEP vaccination to be an extremely cost-effective intervention ( from $200 to less than $60/death averted ) . Switching from intramuscular ( IM ) administration of PEP to equally efficacious intradermal ( ID ) regimens was shown to result in significant savings in the volume of vaccine required to treat the same number of patients , which could mitigate vaccine shortages , and would dramatically reduce the costs of implementing PEP . We present financing mechanisms that would make PEP more affordable and accessible , could help subsidize the cost for those most in need , and could even support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs . We conclude that a universal switch to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims , leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths , as well as being economical for healthcare providers .   \n",

One mechanism developed by the parasite for nutrient acquisition is the attraction of host organelles to the PV . Here , we examined the exploitation of host lipid droplets ( LD ) , ubiquitous fat storage organelles , by Toxoplasma . We show that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells that are depleted of LD , or impaired in TAG lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism . In infected cells , the number of host LD and the expression of host LD-associated genes ( ADRP , DGAT2 ) , progressively increase until the onset of parasite replication . Throughout infection , the PV are surrounded by host LD . Toxoplasma is capable of accessing lipids stored in host LD and incorporates these lipids into its own membranes and LD . Exogenous addition of oleic acid stimulates LD biogenesis in the host cell and results in the overaccumulation of neutral lipids in very large LD inside the parasite . To access LD-derived lipids , Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes within the PV host LD , some of which remaining associated with Rab7 , which become wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes ( IVN ) . Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation display diminished capacity of lipid uptake from host LD . Moreover , parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD in the PV , suggesting a major contribution of the IVN for host LD processing in the PV and , thus lipid content release . Interestingly , gavage of parasites with lipids unveils , for the first time , the presence in Toxoplasma of endocytic-like structures containing lipidic material originating from the PV lumen . This study highlights the reliance of Toxoplasma on host LD for its intracellular development and the parasite’s capability in scavenging neutral lipids from host LD .   \n",

Chemotherapy is the main control measure available , and triclabendazole is the preferred drug since is effective against both juvenile and mature parasites . However , resistance to triclabendazole has been reported in several countries urging the search of new chemical entities and target molecules to control fluke infections . We searched a library of forty flavonoid derivatives for inhibitors of key stage specific Fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases ( FhCL3 and FhCL1 ) . Chalcones substituted with phenyl and naphtyl groups emerged as good cathepsin L inhibitors , interacting more frequently with two putative binding sites within the active site cleft of the enzymes . One of the compounds , C34 , tightly bounds to juvenile specific FhCL3 with an IC50 of 5 . 6 μM . We demonstrated that C34 is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the Cys-His catalytic dyad and key S2 and S3 pocket residues , determinants of the substrate specificity of this family of cysteine proteases . Interestingly , C34 induces a reduction in NEJ ability to migrate through the gut wall and a loss of motility phenotype that leads to NEJ death within a week in vitro , while it is not cytotoxic to bovine cells . Up to date there are no reports of in vitro screening for non-peptidic inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cathepsins , while in general these are considered as the best strategy for in vivo inhibition . We have identified chalcones as novel inhibitors of the two main Cathepsins secreted by juvenile and adult liver flukes . Interestingly , one compound ( C34 ) is highly active towards the juvenile enzyme reducing larval ability to penetrate the gut wall and decreasing NEJ´s viability in vitro . These findings open new avenues for the development of novel agents to control fluke infection and possibly other helminthic diseases .   \n",

We used in vivo imaging to investigate how bipolar cells transmit these signals to the inner retina . We found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters . Individual cells transmit through multiple terminals varying in size , but smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain , followed by more profound adaptation . Smaller terminals transmitted higher stimulus frequencies more effectively . Modeling global calcium dynamics triggering vesicle release indicated that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments contribute directly to all these differences in response dynamics . These results indicate how one neuron can transmit different temporal components in the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with different adaptational properties .   \n",

Fluorescence microscopy ( FM ) and electron microscopy ( EM ) offer complementary advantages and disadvantages for single-synapse analysis . FM combines exquisite molecular discrimination capacities with high speed and low cost , but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging . In contrast , EM remains the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse , but offers only limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly . To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods , we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography ( cAT ) , which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM ( annotated ) images of the same individual synapses . We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM ( muxFM ) image data , and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions . The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries , and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse . Taking human annotation of cAT EM data as ground truth , we show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data , and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions . This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density . We suggest that our probabilistic synapse detector will also be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution FM images , where EM cross-validation is not practical .   \n",

Specifically , zinc is essential for key physiological processes including nucleic acid metabolism , regulation of gene expression , signal transduction , cell division , immune- and nervous system functions , wound healing , and apoptosis . Consequently , impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupts key cellular functions resulting in various human pathologies . Mammalian zinc transport proceeds via two transporter families ZnT and ZIP . However , the detailed mechanism of action of ZnT2 , which is responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and zinc secretion into breast milk during lactation , is currently unknown . Moreover , although the putative coupling of zinc transport to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles has been suggested , it has not been conclusively established . Herein we modeled the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and demonstrated both computationally and experimentally , using functional zinc transport assays , that ZnT2 is indeed a proton-coupled zinc antiporter . Bafilomycin A1 , a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton ATPase ( V-ATPase ) which alkalizes acidic vesicles , abolished ZnT2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles . Moreover , using LysoTracker Red and Lyso-pHluorin , we further showed that upon transient ZnT2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc , the vesicular pH underwent alkalization , presumably due to a proton-zinc antiport; this phenomenon was reversed in the presence of TPEN , a specific zinc chelator . Finally , based on computational energy calculations , we propose that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ ion . Hence , ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven , electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger , concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles on the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm .   \n",

Exonuclease 1 ( Exo1 ) processes stalled replication forks in checkpoint-defective yeast cells . We now identify 14-3-3 proteins as in vivo interaction partners of Exo1 , both in yeast and mammalian cells . Yeast 14-3-3–deficient cells fail to induce Mec1–dependent Exo1 hyperphosphorylation and accumulate Exo1–dependent ssDNA gaps at stalled forks , as revealed by electron microscopy . This leads to persistent checkpoint activation and exacerbated recovery defects . Moreover , using DNA bi-dimensional electrophoresis , we show that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations . We propose that 14-3-3 proteins assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and additional unknown targets , promoting fork progression , stability , and restart in response to DNA replication stress .   \n",

HIV-1 infection in the humanized mouse model leads to persistent HIV-1 infection and immunopathogenesis , including type I interferons ( IFN-I ) induction , immune-activation and depletion of human leukocytes , including CD4 T cells . We developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice . When pDC were depleted prior to HIV-1 infection , the induction of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) were abolished during acute HIV-1 infection with either a highly pathogenic CCR5/CXCR4-dual tropic HIV-1 or a standard CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolate . Consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I , HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice . Interestingly , the cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was severely reduced in pDC-depleted mice . During chronic HIV-1 infection , depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs , associated with elevated HIV-1 replication . Surprisingly , HIV-1 induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs , but not the blood , was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication . The increased cell number in lymphoid organs was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells . We conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis . These findings suggest that pDC-depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retrovirus treatment .   \n",

The impact of Nrf2 activation on human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection has not been tested . Sulforaphane ( SFN ) , produced in cruciferous vegetables after mechanical damage , mobilizes Nrf2 to potently reprogram cellular gene expression . Here we show for the first time that SFN blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells . Similarly SFN blocks infection in PMA-differentiated promonocytic cell lines , but not in other cell lines tested . siRNA-mediated depletion of Nrf2 boosted HIV infectivity in primary macrophages and reduced the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment . This supports a model in which anti-viral activity is mediated through Nrf2 after it is mobilized by SFN . We further found that , like the type I interferon-induced cellular anti-viral proteins SAMHD1 and MX2 , SFN treatment blocks infection after entry , but before formation of 2-LTR circles . Interestingly however , neither SAMHD1 nor MX2 were upregulated . This shows for the first time that Nrf2 action can potently block HIV infection and highlights a novel way to trigger this inhibition .   \n",

During a community-based cross-sectional survey , pregnant women were interviewed and asked to provide a blood sample and a single fecal sample . Hemoglobin was measured and a blood slide examined for malaria . Geohelminth infections were identified using the concentration and Kato-Katz method . Among 390 participants who provided a stool sample , 76 . 2% were infected with at least one geohelminth: 52 . 3% with Ascaris lumbricoides , 39 . 5% with hookworm , and 29 . 0% with Trichuris trichiura . Infection with at least one geohelminth species was associated with the use of an unprotected water source ( adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1 . 8 , 95% confidence interval [CI] 1 . 1–3 . 0 ) and the lack of treatment of drinking water ( AOR 1 . 8 , 95% CI 1 . 1–3 . 1 ) . Geohelminth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms , or low body mass index . A hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid upper arm circumference ( adjusted mean decrease 0 . 7 cm , 95% CI 0 . 3–1 . 2 cm ) . Hookworm infections with an egg count ≥1000/gram feces ( 11 women ) were associated with lower hemoglobin ( adjusted mean decrease 1 . 5 g/dl , 95% CI 0 . 3–2 . 7 ) . Among gravidae 2 and 3 , women with A . lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia ( OR 0 . 4 , 95% CI 0 . 2–0 . 8 ) compared to women without A . lumbricoides , unlike other gravidity groups . Geohelminth infections are common in this pregnant population; however , there were few observed detrimental effects . Routine provision of antihelminth treatment during an antenatal clinic visit is recommended , but in this area an evaluation of the impact on pregnancy , malaria , and birth outcome is useful .   \n",

The latter were recently shown to result from mycolactone blocking the Sec61-dependent production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells . Here we investigated whether mycolactone similarly affects the inflammatory responses of the nervous cell subsets involved in pain perception , transmission and maintenance . We also investigated the effects of mycolactone on the neuroinflammation that is associated with chronic pain in vivo . Sensory neurons , Schwann cells and microglia were isolated from mice for ex vivo assessment of mycolactone cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory activity by measuring the production of proalgesic cytokines and chemokines . In all cell types studied , prolonged ( >48h ) exposure to mycolactone induced significant cell death at concentrations >10 ng/ml . Within the first 24h treatment , nanomolar concentrations of mycolactone efficiently suppressed the cell production of pro-inflammatory mediators , without affecting their viability . Notably , mycolactone also prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia . Since these cells critically contribute to neuroinflammation , we next tested if mycolactone impacts this pathogenic process in vivo . We used a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve . Here , mycolactone was injected daily for 3 days in the spinal canal , to ensure its proper delivery to spinal cord . While this treatment failed to prevent injury-induced neuroinflammation , it decreased significantly the local production of inflammatory cytokines without inducing detectable cytotoxicity . The present study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence that mycolactone suppresses the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons , Schwann cells and microglia , without affecting the cell viability . Together with previous studies using peripheral blood leukocytes , our work implies that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may , at least partially , be explained by its anti-inflammatory properties .   \n",

In order to test if this clinical diversity is influenced by host genetic determinants , the association between candidate gene polymorphisms and HAT outcome was investigated in populations from HAT active foci in Guinea . Samples were collected from 425 individuals; comprising of 232 HAT cases , 79 subjects with long lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology and 114 endemic controls . Genotypes of 28 SNPs in eight genes passed quality control and were used for an association analysis . IL6 rs1818879 allele A ( p = 0 . 0001 , OR = 0 . 39 , CI95 = [0 . 24–0 . 63] , BONF = 0 . 0034 ) was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease . MIF rs36086171 allele G seemed to be associated with an increased risk ( p = 0 . 0239 , OR = 1 . 65 , CI95 = [1 . 07–2 . 53] , BONF = 0 . 6697 ) but did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction . Similarly MIF rs12483859 C allele seems be associated with latent infections ( p = 0 . 0077 , OR = 1 . 86 , CI95 = [1 . 18–2 . 95] , BONF = 0 . 2157 ) . We confirmed earlier observations that APOL1 G2 allele ( DEL ) ( p = 0 . 0011 , OR = 2 . 70 , CI95 = [1 . 49–4 . 91] , BONF = 0 . 0301 ) is associated with a higher risk and APOL1 G1 polymorphism ( p = 0 . 0005 , OR = 0 . 45 , CI95 = [0 . 29–0 . 70] , BONF = 0 . 0129 ) with a lower risk of developing HAT . No associations were found with other candidate genes . Our data show that host genes are involved in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea with IL6 rs1818879 being associated with a lower risk of progressing to active HAT . These results enhance our understanding of host-parasite interactions and , ultimately , may lead to the development of new control tools .   "

       "      <td>Gene expression varies widely between individuals of a population , and regulatory change can underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical relevance . A key question in the field is how DNA sequence variants impact gene expression , with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence . By contrast , the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown , owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3′ untranslated regions . In this work , we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals . Our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ gene ends , finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements , including miRNA sites . The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals , and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay . Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation . \\n Naturally occurring genetic differences in gene regulation within populations underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical interest [1]–[3] and can serve as the basis for inference of regulatory networks [4] , [5] . A key problem in the field is understanding the molecular mechanisms by which DNA sequence variants give rise to expression change . Recent work has emphasized the importance of sequence differences in regions upstream of gene loci that harbor cis-acting determinants of transcription factor binding [6]–[10] and chromatin architecture [11]–[13] . Much less is known about the role of 3′-end regulation as a determinant of expression variation between individuals . Alternative polyadenylation represents a major regulatory strategy in the human genome , with analysis across tissue types detecting multiple 3′ UTR forms of over half of all human genes [14] . Detailed genetic studies have implicated polymorphisms affecting transcript termination in both Mendelian and complex human disease [15]–[20] . Genomic analyses have hinted at a broader role for genetic differences in RNA 3′-end processing as a driver of expression variation [6] , [8] , [21] , [22] , but the prevalence and the mechanisms of these changes are incompletely understood . Progress in dissecting the genetics of 3′-end processing has been limited in part by fundamental questions about the regulatory information encoded in 3′ UTRs . Single-gene studies have made clear that , in addition to its interplay with exonic splicing [23] , [24] , RNA 3′-end processing can dictate the extent of 3′ UTR sequence incorporated into mature transcripts that governs half-life , translation , and localization [25]–[29]; the efficiency of transcription termination itself can also influence steady-state expression level of a given length form [30]–[34] . In general , however , identifying the regulatory elements that underlie relationships between 3′ UTR sequence and gene expression remains a primary challenge , and for the majority of human genes , the regulatory impact of alternative polyadenylation is unknown . Likewise , the search for molecular players underlying cis-regulation of 3′-end processing at individual gene loci [23] and genome-scale regulation of 3′-end processing in trans [14] , [29] , [35]–[40] is an area of active research . A complete understanding of the genetics of alternative polyadenylation will require maps of transcript end site usage and 3′ cis-regulatory elements , and analysis strategies to integrate the data . Recently developed short-read sequencing methods for transcript ends [40]–[46] have enabled the possibility of quantitative studies of the regulatory architecture of transcript end forms on a genomic scale . In this work , we set out to investigate mechanisms by which alternative polyadenylation impacts gene expression and its variation across genetically distinct human individuals . We used 3′-end RNA-seq [42] to maximize the genomic coverage and precision of transcript end positions , and to measure quantitative expression levels of transcript forms . The results shed light on the architecture of transcript ends and regulatory elements in human 3′ UTRs and the principles of genetic variation in 3′ length form usage . \\n To survey the 3′ ends of transcripts in human B-lymphoblastoid cells , we isolated RNA from cell lines derived from six human individuals and subjected each replicate of each sample to 3′-end RNA-seq , which sequences polyadenylated transcript ends on a genomic scale [42] with strong and significant reproducibility ( Figure S1 ) . Our analysis pipeline , described in Materials and Methods , filtered out likely products of mispriming from A-rich genomic regions [47] and categorized mapping reads in terms of well-defined peaks or dispersed regions of reads with no peak structure ( Table S1 ) . We considered the former to represent the strongest candidates for stable , functional transcript end forms , and focused on these for in-depth analysis , taking the last mapped base of each read as the likely site at which the nascent RNA was cleaved from the processing polymerase and polyadenylated [24] . Across such transcript ends mapping to nuclear-encoded loci , the vast majority of reads ( 87% ) originated from 3′ UTRs of coding genes ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ) ; 80% of transcript ends were consistent with the 3′ ends of previously annotated length forms ( Tables S1 and S2 and Figure S2 ) . Within 40 base pairs of the inferred cleavage position , most transcript end forms harbored a polyadenylation signal sequence: either the canonical A ( A/U ) UAAA [23] or a close variant , or an A-rich stretch [48]–[50] ( Figure S3A ) . Reporter assays confirmed the regulatory importance of A-rich stretches upstream of the inferred cleavage positions in CPSF1 and WDR18 , whose 3′ UTRs lacked canonical polyadenylation signal motifs ( Figure S3C ) . We set out to analyze our data set of 3′ transcript ends with respect to alternative polyadenylation , focusing on a maximum of two abundant , distinguishable transcript forms in a given gene . We considered three patterns of transcript end usage [30]: class I , indicating genes with a single transcript form terminating in an annotated 3′ UTR; class II , genes with alternative polyadenylation in the same annotated 3′ UTR; and class III , genes in which the two alternative polyadenylation forms differed in their composition of coding sequence ( Figure 1B ) . We also observed a small fraction of genes with a single transcript form terminating inside annotated coding exons or introns ( Table S3 ) . The breakdown of transcript forms into these classes revealed alternative polyadenylation reaching our threshold of detection in ∼30% of genes ( Figure 1B ) . Across these genes , we observed the expected enrichment of the A ( A/U ) UAAA polyadenylation signal motif in the distal relative to proximal polyadenylation signals ( Figure S3A ) , correlating with the higher expression levels of the long transcript forms [30] , [51] . The lower-abundance short transcript forms were more likely to harbor an A-rich stretch or no recognizable polyadenylation signal motif upstream of the inferred cleavage position ( Figure S3B ) , lending credence to the notion that the latter regions represent weak recognition sites for the 3′-end processing machinery [48] . We sought to harness our data set of transcript ends to investigate regulatory elements governing translation and transcript half-life , and their relationship to alternative 3′ transcript forms . For this purpose , we applied a motif-search strategy to identify putative microRNA binding sites , A/U rich elements ( AREs ) , G/U-rich elements , binding sites for the Pumilio family of proteins , and Alu transposable elements in 3′ UTRs . We tabulated rates of sequence variation across human populations and observed marked conservation of most regulatory element motifs relative to the background level of 3′ UTR polymorphism ( Figure 2A ) , reflecting a history of purifying selection on these putatively functional regulatory sequences [52]–[54] . We expected that the regulatory logic of alternative polyadenylation would be intimately connected with sequence determinants of transcript half-life or translation in 3′ UTRs . For a given gene subject to alternative polyadenylation , we referred to the region of the 3′ UTR upstream of the proximal cleavage site as “shared” among the alternative polyadenylation length forms , and the span of the 3′ UTR in between the proximal and distal cleavage sites as the “differential” region ( Figure 2B ) . We hypothesized that , if alternative polyadenylation often acted to tune the exposure of cis-regulatory motifs in 3′ UTR sequences , these motifs would preferentially be positioned in differential regions . To test this , we tabulated the positions of each type of regulatory element across our set of alternatively polyadenylated genes in class II . Significance testing revealed a significant enrichment of genes with motifs in the differential regions of 3′ UTRs relative to those with motifs in shared regions ( Figure 2C ) . Analyzing the annotations of genes in these sets , we observed a preponderance of genes with immune-related functions among those with cis-regulatory motifs in the differential regions of 3′ UTRs , while motifs in shared regions of 3′ UTRs were largely detected among genes with housekeeping roles ( Table S5 ) . Thus , for genes carrying out immune processes in B-lymphoblastoid cells , the choice between long and short transcript end forms often exposes or eliminates regulatory information in 3′ UTRs , highlighting the importance of 3′-end processing in the control of gene expression levels for specialized cell functions . To investigate the genetics of RNA 3′-end processing , we first assessed the contribution of genetic differences , relative to experimental and environmental error , to variation of transcript 3′-end positions across the six genotypes of lymphoblastoid cells in our study . For this purpose , we calculated the heritability of length form abundance for each gene , finding 194 coding genes at which the abundances of transcript length forms differed reproducibly ( heritability&gt;0 . 6 ) across human samples ( Table S6 ) . To begin to dissect the molecular basis for natural genetic variation in 3′-end usage at these loci , we considered the potential role for DNA sequence differences at polyadenylation signals , the primary determinants of transcript cleavage and polyadenylation . We reasoned that although such variants were rare in the human population ( Figure 2A ) , some could underlie differences between human individuals in 3′-end length form usage . Consistent with this prediction , genes with highly heritable transcript end positions harbored a single nucleotide polymorphism in polyadenylation signal motif sequence much more often than did the average gene ( 2% of polyadenylation signals at genes with heritable transcript ends , compared to 0 . 3% genome-wide; Fisher's exact p = 0 . 004; Table S6 ) . We hypothesized that naturally occurring genetic variation in RNA 3′-end processing would prove to underlie changes across individuals in steady-state levels of gene expression . To test this , we analyzed the genomic relationship between biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and gene expression differences across our set of lymphoblastoid cell lines from distinct human genotypes . We used a standard regression test of genetic association to evaluate genotype at each such sequence variant as a predictor of expression of the gene in which it lay . The results revealed a significant enrichment of association with expression for variants in polyadenylation signals , relative to the background signal from 3′ UTRs as a whole ( Figure 3A ) . We expected that for a given such variant , the allele conferring a closer match to the canonical polyadenylation signal motif would confer more robust transcription termination , and thus more abundant steady-state levels of transcription , than would the allele weakening the match to the canonical motif . To quantify this effect , we scored each allele in each variant polyadenylation signal with respect to agreement with the canonical motif , and at each variant position , we calculated the difference in scores between alleles . This score difference was a strong predictor of the effect of a given polyadenylation signal variant on steady-state expression levels ( Figure 3B ) , with a departure from the polyadenylation signal motif associated with a drop in expression as predicted . To pursue on a molecular basis the impact of variation across humans in polyadenylation signals , we used our 3′-end RNA-seq data to infer the effects of single-nucleotide variants on usage of 3′ transcript forms at individual genes , and we evaluated these predictions in single-gene 3′ UTR reporter assays . For each gene , toggling natural variant alleles at one nucleotide position in the polyadenylation signal was sufficient to drive differential usage of short and long 3′ transcript forms ( Figure 4 ) . These included variants attenuating usage of 3′ forms of the translation initiation factor EIF2A and the putative DNA methylation enzyme DIP2B , as well as the expected effect of the polymorphic polyadenylation signal on usage of 3′ forms of the inflammation regulator IRF5 [15] . In each of the latter genes , the causal variant conferred significant changes in luciferase protein levels as well as usage of transcript forms ( Figure 4A–F ) . Our set of confirmed causal variants at polyadenylation signals also included that in the transcription factor NAB1 , which attenuated usage of a minor 3′ transcript form with modest effect on luciferase levels ( Figure 4G , H ) . We conclude that sequence differences in polyadenylation signals represent a key mechanism underlying variation between humans in levels of gene expression , with genome-scale trends validated at the single-gene level . We next sought to dissect the mechanisms by which natural variation in 3′-end usage impacted gene expression , using as case studies IRF5 and DIP2B , which lie in genomic regions associated with susceptibility to lupus [15] and colorectal cancer [55] , respectively , as well as NAB1 and EIF2A . In RNA expression measurements using the 3′ UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms of a given gene , one form was detected at higher abundance in each case ( Figure 4B , D , F , H ) . We hypothesized that these abundance differences between length forms could be in part the result of sequence elements that dictate transcript cleavage , polyadenylation , and termination , and in part the result of regulatory elements that affect transcript half-life . To test this , for each gene we first developed expression reporters incorporating only the regions flanking the end positions of each transcript form in turn , which we expected would include the polyadenylation signal and auxiliary sequence motifs underlying 3′-end processing of the respective form while excluding most other 3′ regulatory information . Expression measurements confirmed differences in the strength of these 3′-end processing motifs between length forms for EIF2A , IRF5 , and DIP2B , in that reporters incorporating each of the two 3′-end sequences from a given gene exhibited up to 2 . 5-fold differences in expression ( Figure 5A , C , E ) . To assess the contribution of 3′ regulatory elements that control transcript half-life , we next measured the decay rate of each transcript length form upon addition of actinomycin D in the context of complete 3′ UTRs . Measurements of transcript stability by quantitative PCR and by Northern blot bore out this prediction , with the long transcript form showing reduced half-life relative to the short form for IRF5 [15] and DIP2B ( Figure 5D , F and Figure S4B , C ) , and increased half-life for NAB1 ( Figure 5H and Figure S4D ) . Analyzing these results together with the effects of natural variants in polyadenylation signals ( Figure 4 ) indicates that for a given gene , a variant can abrogate production of a transcript form with strong sequence determinants of 3′-end processing , leaving only the less efficiently processed form and giving rise to lower total expression of the gene product , as in IRF5 and EIF2A . In addition , a variant abrogating production of a transcript form with longer half-life leaves only the less-stable form and reduces total steady-state levels of the gene product , as in IRF5 and DIP2B . As a further investigation of the determinants of abundance of long and short transcript forms for genes subject to natural genetic change in 3′-end processing , we analyzed the role of 3′ regulatory elements in such genes in relation to trans-acting regulatory factors . We identified a candidate ARE in the differential region of the 3′ UTR of IRF5 , i . e . between the positions of alternative 3′ ends observed in our 3′-end RNA-seq; a candidate ARE in the differential region of NAB1; and a candidate binding site for the miRNA miR-101 in the differential region of DIP2B ( Figure 6 ) . To assess the functional relevance of these motifs , we applied a mutagenesis strategy using 3′ UTR reporter constructs for each gene , as above distinguishing between the 3′ UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms and the haplotype producing only the long form ( Figure 4D , F , H ) . For each inferred cis-regulatory element , we assayed the regulatory response of 3′ UTR reporters to the trans-acting factor predicted to mediate its repressive effect: the ARE-binding proteins TTP and AUF1 for IRF5 and NAB1 , respectively , and a mimic of miR-101 for DIP2B . In each case , expression measurements from mutagenized reporter constructs established the respective sequence element as necessary for full repression of the long form of its host UTR ( Figure 6 ) , validating our motif inferences . Among experiments that used haplotypes producing both short and long 3′ forms of the respective UTRs , motifs in the differential region were only necessary for repression by trans-acting factors in the case of NAB1 ( Figure 6C ) , for which the population of transcripts arising from this haplotype was dominated by the long form ( Figure 4H ) . Taken together , our results illustrate the complexity of regulatory information in 3′ UTRs , as determinants of RNA 3′-end processing and transcript fate each contribute to the final expression level of the host gene . We conclude that , for these case studies , integrating predicted regulatory motifs with knowledge of transcript end positions is essential in the effort to relate genotype to gene expression . We next aimed to shed light on the biological context in which differences in regulatory responsiveness could manifest between long and short transcript forms . For this purpose , we focused on natural variation in alternative polyadenylation at the immune regulator IRF5 . In response to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , immune genes undergo an immediate spike in expression , followed by dampening to a more modest steady-state level mediated by the ARE-binding protein TTP [56]–[58] . Motivated by our discovery of a repressive ARE in the differential region of IRF5 ( Figure 6A ) , we hypothesized that the genetically determined production of long and short 3′ mRNA forms of this gene would be associated with different patterns of regulatory behavior after induction . To test this , we treated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from genetically distinct individuals with LPS and , in each culture , measured the recovery of expression levels of IRF5 transcript forms over time . The results , shown in Figure 7 , revealed , after an initial overshoot in expression , a difference of up to 2-fold in the time to reach steady-state expression between long and short mRNA forms , with the long form downregulated to steady-state more quickly after induction as predicted , given the presence of the repressive ARE in the latter transcript . Variation in IRF5 expression recovery across B-lymphoblastoid lines was associated with genotype at the proximal polyadenylation signal in the IRF5 3′ UTR: haplotypes encoding the long form of IRF5 conferred rapid repression after induction ( Figure 7B ) relative to haplotypes encoding the short form ( Figure 7A ) . These findings suggest that genetic variation in 3′-end processing dictates differences across individuals in the regulatory dynamics of IRF5 , further underscoring the power of our approach to identify biologically relevant regulatory effects of 3′-end processing . Our molecular confirmation of cis-regulatory elements in 3′ UTRs inferred from sequence search methods ( Figure 6 ) suggested that such inference could provide a mechanistic understanding of gene expression on a genomic scale . In particular , we expected that sequence variants between individuals in 3′ regulatory elements would be significant predictors of variation in steady-state expression of the genes in which they lay . To test this notion , we first tabulated all single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the cell lines of our data set which overlapped with 3′ regulatory motifs and Alu elements in 3′ UTRs . We next classified these motifs according to the impact of alternative polyadenylation on their positions in 3′ UTRs , and we used association tests to assess the strength of each motif variant in each class as a predictor of steady-state expression of its respective gene . The results ( Figure 8 ) revealed association with expression across human individuals , for variants in AREs , G/U-rich elements , Pumilio sites , and Alu elements . The relationship with expression was striking and significant for variants in regions of 3′ UTRs constitutively incorporated into mature messages ( Figure 8 ) . Polymorphic motifs incorporated into low-abundance 3′ length forms showed no evidence of association with expression changes in their respective genes , consistent with the minor contribution of these forms; by the same token , polymorphic motifs in regions incorporated into the predominant 3′ length forms of mRNAs were more strongly associated with expression of their respective genes , though not significantly so ( Figure 8 ) . As expected [6] , the relationship between sequence variants and gene expression did not manifest for miRNA sites ( data not shown ) . These findings highlight the relevance of 3′ regulatory motifs as predictors of expression variation across human individuals , when integrated with knowledge of transcript length forms from our sequencing strategy . \\n Alternative polyadenylation is prevalent in the human transcriptome , and in landmark cases , variation across individuals in the use of 3′ length forms of RNAs has been shown to underlie human disease [15]–[20] . However , for most human genes , the regulatory importance of changes in transcript ends between individuals is incompletely understood , owing to the challenges of measuring 3′-end usage and identifying functional regulatory elements in 3′ UTRs . We have developed a spatially precise , quantitative , high-throughput sequencing approach for 3′ ends , complementing now-classic studies of expressed sequence tags [30] , [36] , [48] , [51] , [59]–[61] . We have used the resulting transcript end positions and abundances to pioneer an analysis approach which integrates bioinformatic predictions of 3′ regulatory motifs , genomic analysis , and molecular genetics . With this strategy , we have established a regulatory map of transcript ends and functional elements in the 3′ UTRs of lymphoblastoid cells , and we have abstracted genomic principles of alternative polyadenylation and natural genetic variation in this cell type . Our mapping of 3′-end length forms and sequence motifs in 3′ UTRs revealed an intuitive logic in which the choice between short and long UTR forms governs the incorporation of regulatory elements into mature messages [36] , [61] . We note that the 3′ length forms we report in B-lymphoblastoid cells represent a subset of the total complement of 3′ UTR lengths used across tissues . As such , we hypothesize that surveys of tissue types will ultimately reveal transcript forms of many genes , used in particular contexts , that incorporate 3′ regulatory information to different extents . The ability to tune the responsiveness to trans-acting input itself distinguishes alternative polyadenylation from other transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms , providing a compelling model for the particular advantage of 3′-end processing as a regulatory strategy and a rationale for its prevalence in mammalian genomes . In comparisons across cell lines from genetically distinct individuals , we analyzed the regulatory importance of genetic changes at 3′ transcript ends . We uncovered a key role for polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals as a driver of changes in gene expression , and we detailed the molecular mechanisms at play . The polyadenylation variants we study here dictate the production of transcript forms with different determinants of 3′-end processing , different half-lives , and different recognition sites for trans-acting regulators . These findings establish a connection between observational studies of transcript 3′ length forms across human populations [21] , [22] and regulatory effects of this variation . In the case of IRF5 , we discovered that a naturally occurring genetic change in usage of 3′ RNA forms can serve to tune the kinetics of recovery of expression after induction by lipopolysaccharide . Thus , against the backdrop of prior studies of this lupus susceptibility gene [15] , we have uncovered an additional dimension by which variation in RNA 3′-end processing affects regulatory behavior . Given these case-study results as a validation of our genome-scale analyses , we speculate that many genetic variants with biologically relevant effects mediated by RNA 3′-end processing remain to be discovered in the human population . We have also shown that polymorphisms in 3′ motifs that govern transcript fate can serve as predictors of steady-state levels of the genes in which they lie . In light of the ultimate goal of predicting regulatory and phenotypic effects from human genome sequence , our results indicate that analysis strategies using sequence determinants of transcription initiation and splicing alone are likely to provide an incomplete model of expression variation . Importantly , however , our work makes clear that binding sites for regulators of mRNA localization , half-life , and translation at 3′ ends are themselves only part of the regulatory landscape . Rather , a complete understanding of the genetics of gene expression will integrate the usage of RNA 3′-end processing signals with the effects of 3′ sequence elements that control transcript fate . We anticipate that abundances and positions of transcript ends observed in 3′-end RNA-seq will prove to be a key component in the systems-level modeling of regulatory networks and their variation . In summary , while the genetic study of RNA 3′-end processing is in its infancy , our work and that of others [15]–[22] establishes that variation at 3′ ends can be a critical determinant of regulatory behaviors . However , for the vast majority of human genes , the importance of 3′ regulatory change remains unknown . Our single-gene experiments detail the expression effects of 3′ UTR variation in the disease-associated genes IRF5 [15] and DIP2B [55]; the potential for regulatory variants as drivers of human disease will serve as continued motivation for genomic and genetic analyses of expression change . \\n Two biological replicates of each of the human lymphoblastoid cell lines GM10860 , GM17106 , GM17189 , GM17207 , GM17220 , and GM17253 ( Coriell Institute ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamate and 15% fetal bovine serum . Cells were incubated at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide . Total RNA was extracted from ∼107 cells using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) , and genomic DNA was removed from RNA using Turbo DNase ( Ambion ) . Polyadenylated RNA was selected from 10 µg of total RNA using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit ( Invitrogen ) , and was fragmented for 3 minutes at 70°C using 10× Fragmentation Reagent ( Ambion ) . After ethanol precipitation , polyadenylated RNA fragments were selected using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II ( Invitrogen ) and anchored oligo-dT ( Invitrogen ) . Double-stranded cDNA was generated using RNase H ( Invitrogen ) and DNA Pol I ( Invitrogen ) , end-repaired using T4 DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) , Klenow DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) , and T4 PNK ( New England Biolabs ) , and then adenylated using Klenow 3′ to 5′ exo minus ( New England Biolabs ) . Illumina paired-end adapters were ligated to the adenylated cDNA using T4 DNA Ligase ( Enzymatics ) . Ligated cDNA was purified on a 2% agarose gel and then amplified by performing 12 cycles of PCR using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . Libraries were sequenced using 40 bp paired-end modules on an Illumina 2G Genome Analyzer . Consecutive T's from the beginning of all reads were trimmed and classified before mapping: for a given read , if there were more than 20 consecutive T's or if neither mate of a read pair had a stretch of T's , the read was not included in further analysis . For mapping , the set of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) segregating in the CEU population was downloaded from HapMap phase II+III , release 27 ( ftp://ftp . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/hapmap/genotypes ) , and used to modify the human reference genome ( hg18; [62] ) by incorporating the appropriate ambiguous bases at each SNP position . All reads were then mapped to this modified genome and to the associated splicing junctions in the Known Genes database of the UCSC genome browser [63] using MOSAIK ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) . For a given length of trimmed T's , nT , a splicing junction reference was created by concatenating 37 - nT bp from each exon adjacent to the splicing junction to ensure that the reads mapped across the splicing junction . If the reads mapped to both the genome and a splicing junction , the mapping with smaller number of mismatches was used . Only uniquely mapped reads with two or fewer mismatches in each mate were retained . Trimmed T's were then compared to the genome sequence; reads with &gt;2 mismatches to the genome in this poly-T tract were retained for analysis . We inferred that a given read was transcribed from the minus strand of the genome if , when it was mapped to the reference genome , the position of its poly-T tract had a lower coordinate position than the mapped position of the other end of the read; we inferred that a read was transcribed from the plus strand of the genome if the mapped position of its poly-T tract had a higher coordinate position than the position of the other end . Mapped reads yielded an average coverage of 22 . 6% of UCSC annotated 3′ UTRs with a depth of 97 . 8 reads/bp for the covered bases for each sample . The last 100 bp of annotated 3′ UTRs were even more highly represented in libraries , with an average coverage of 43 . 4% and an average depth of 211 . 1 reads/bp . Mapped reads from all samples were pooled , sorted according to the polyA positions , defined as the coordinate of the base adjacent to the polyA tail , and then grouped into tag clusters as follows . For each strand of each chromosome , the 5′ boundary of a tag cluster was set as the polyA position of the first read , and then reads were sequentially added to this unit until the polyA position of the next read was more than 15 bp away . The latter position then became the 5′ boundary of the next tag cluster . Most tag clusters spanned less than 24 bp , but if the polyA positions in a cluster spanned more than 40 bp , we applied a peak-finding algorithm as follows . For each genome coordinate in the region corresponding to the tag cluster , we defined the read count as the number of reads whose polyA position overlapped the coordinate . From these we first identified the genome coordinate ( posM ) with the greatest read count ( MaxHeight ) . We then delineated a window 40 bp upstream and 40 bp downstream of this coordinate . Within this window , we retained all coordinates with read counts greater than 10% of MaxHeight . Of these , we identified the most 5′ and 3′ polyA positions ( posL and posR ) . All reads in the tag cluster were then divided into three new candidate tag clusters: reads with positions 5′ to posL , reads with positions including and between posL and posR , and reads with positions 3′ to posR . If the distance between posL and posR was longer than 40 bp , the middle candidate tag cluster was eliminated from further analysis . If the read counts of all coordinates in a candidate tag cluster were below 10% of MaxHeight , the candidate unit was eliminated . If a candidate tag cluster contained coordinates with read counts larger than 10% of MaxHeight , we identified the coordinate with the largest read count within this candidate tag cluster and repeated the peak-finding algorithm . For each tag cluster retained for analysis , we defined the polyA position of the unit as the median of the polyA positions of all reads encompassed by the unit . After establishing that the stretch of A's in each read represented a mismatch to the genome sequence ( see above ) , we filtered out reads with a potential origin from internal priming from A-rich regions of the genome by removing any tag cluster whose defined polyA position was followed by 10 or more A's in the genome sequence within 20 bp . We also filtered out reads with a potential origin as PCR clones or false mapping as follows . We expected that for a given set of paired-end reads falling into a tag cluster , the characteristics of read ends originating from biological 3′-end processing should be distinct from the characteristics of read ends originating from fragmentation , reverse transcription , and ligation during RNA-seq library preparation . In particular , we reasoned that the polyA positions of a set of reads in a tag cluster with origin as a biologically relevant transcript would be less heterogeneous than the positions of the other mates of the reads . If the opposite were true , we considered the tag cluster to be a likely product of false mapping or PCR duplication . As such , we retained a tag cluster for analysis only if the precision of polyA positions across the reads of the unit was greater than the precision of the positions of the other mates . The precision was calculated by where ni is the number of reads at the ith position and N is the total number of reads in the tag cluster . We also filtered out any tag cluster whose total read count across all samples amounted to fewer than 50 reads . For tag clusters with read counts between 50 and 100 , we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient R between each pair of the two biological replicates across the six cell line samples , and eliminated the tag cluster from further analysis if the absolute value of R was less than 0 . 5 . For use in searches for regulatory motifs , we harnessed all 3′-end RNA-seq reads in tag clusters from all samples to define a consensus base at each position in 3′ UTRs as follows . At every genomic coordinate covered by five or more 3′-end RNA-seq reads , the consensus nucleotide was chosen as that with highest frequency across the sample . If the second most abundant base was more than 20% in abundance , it was incorporated into the consensus using an ambiguous base notation ( M = A or C , R = A or G , W = A or T , S = C or G , Y = C or T , K = G or T ) . For every tag cluster , the consensus sequence of the region 40 bp upstream from the polyA position was searched for a polyadenylation signal using the known hexamer motifs sorted by their abundance in the human genome from [30] . Polyadenylation signals with higher abundance were given higher priority when there was more than one instance in the 40 bp upstream window . In the absence of a match to these motifs , the 40 bp upstream window was searched for an A-rich stretch as follows . We identified any 9 bp regions containing at least 6 A's and considered each such region a candidate polyadenylation signal; if no such candidate signal were present , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable polyadenylation signal . If more than one candidate signal was present , we retained the one with the most A's . For each boundary of this region , if the boundary nucleotide was an A , the region was extended to include all consecutive A's . If the first base was not an A , it was trimmed until the first base was an A . To find upstream U-rich elements ( USE ) , for a given tag cluster , we identified a candidate USE as the 9-bp window with the highest number of T's in the consensus sequence , within 30 bp upstream of the polyadenylation signal . If there were fewer than six T's or if the candidate did not have three consecutive T's , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable USE . For each boundary of a given candidate window , if the boundary nucleotide was a T , the window wasextended if there was a T in the adjacent 2 bp and the proportion of T's in the window was above 65%; if the boundary base was not a T , we trimmed the candidate window until a T was reached . To find downstream U/G-rich elements ( DSE ) , for a given tag cluster , we identified a candidate DSE as the 9-bp window with the highest number of T's in the consensus sequence , within 40 bp downstream of the poly-A position . If there were fewer than five T's or if the window did not contain at least one of the strings TTT , TGTG , GTGT , GTCT , CTGT , TCTG , or TGTC , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable DSE . For each boundary of a given candidate window , if the boundary nucleotide was a T , the window was extended if there was a T in the adjacent 2 bp and the proportion of T's in the window was above 50%; if the boundary base was not a T , we trimmed the candidate window until a T was reached . Human gene annotations were downloaded from the Known Genes database of the UCSC Genome Browser [63] . Among the UCSC transcript annotations that overlapped the start and end positions of a tag cluster , the annotation with the minimum distance between the annotated 3′-end position and the polyA position of the tag cluster was chosen . If there were multiple annotations with the same 3′-end positions , we chose the annotation with greatest degree of overlap between the tag cluster consensus sequence and the annotated exons . The genomic coordinates of human expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) with polyA tails were downloaded from the polyA_db2 database [64] . The genomic coordinates were converted from hg17 to hg18 using the liftOver tool from the UCSC Genome Browser [65] . If the coordinate of polyA_db2 EST was between the start and end position of a tag cluster , we considered the length form corresponding to the unit to be supported by the EST . All tag clusters with the same UCSC gene annotation were categorized as associated with the gene , and only the two tag clusters with the highest expression per gene were used for classification of alternative polyadenylation . We classified each gene as follows: class I if there was only one tag cluster overlapping with the annotated 3′ UTR of the gene; class II if both tag clusters overlapped with the annotated 3′ UTR of the gene and they were associated with the same UCSC transcript ID; class III if one of the tag clusters overlapped witha coding exon or intron , or if both tag clusters overlapped with 3′ UTRs with different UCSC transcript IDs . We calculated the broad-sense heritability in polyA positions using biological replicates of 3′-end RNA-seq across the six human cell lines as follows . For a given gene , we considered the polyA position of the most abundant tag cluster in each replicate of each sample as a quantitative trait , and calculated the heritability H2 of this trait from intraclass correlations [66] given by the following equations . Here , indices i and j refer to sample and replicate , respectively; is the polyA position for sample i , replicate j; is the average between two replicates for sample i; is the average of all samples and replicates; MSe is the error mean square ( within-individual ) and MSb is the between-individual mean square . Heritability of total expression levels for each gene was calculated analogously , using as a quantitative trait the sum of read counts across the gene normalized by the sum of all reads . To identify microRNA binding sites in 3′ UTRs , the Perl script from TargetScan Release 5 . 2 [67] was used to predict miRNA binding sites in the 3′ UTR sequences of all expressed genes . miRNA sequences and families were downloaded from the TargetScan database . Only predicted binding sites with context scores less than −0 . 4 were used for analysis . To identify AU-rich elements , the class II motif WWWT ( ATTTA ) TTTW was searched in the 3′ UTR sequences of all expressed genes allowing up to one mismatch outside the central pentamer , ATTTA . Overlapping motifs were combined . To identify GU-rich destabilizing elements , the motif TGTTTGTTTGT was searched in 3′ UTR sequences allowing up to one mismatch . To identify Pumilio binding elements , the motif TGTANATA was searched in 3′ UTR sequences . Alu transposable element motifs were taken from RepeatMasker ( www . repeatmasker . org ) downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser . We note that each search strategy used human sequence data alone rather than inter- or intra-species conservation to identify motifs . SNPs within the human population were downloaded from the 1000 Genomes Project database [68] . Genomic coordinates were converted from hg19 to hg18 using the liftOver tool from the UCSC Genome Browser [65] . For each regulatory element motif , the SNP rate was calculated as the total number of SNPs within all motif matches divided by the sum of the lengths of all matches . For the background model of sequence variation in 3′ UTRs used in Table S4 , we first tabulated all instances of A , C , T , and G across all positions of 3′ UTR sequences in the hg18 human reference genome , where the boundaries of 3′-ends were taken from our compendium of 3′-end RNA-seq data for genes expressed in our samples . We refer to these frequencies as P ( A ) , P ( C ) , P ( T ) , and P ( G ) , respectively . We then tabulated the SNP rate separately for each of these four sets of base positions from the 1000 Genomes data set , which we refer to as P ( SNP , A ) , P ( SNP , C ) , P ( SNP , T ) , and P ( SNP , G ) , respectively . We used these values to calculate the expected density of polymorphisms for the stretch of genome corresponding to a given 3′ motif match as: where is the sequence of bases of length Ns corresponding to the motif match in the human reference genome and P ( SNP|si ) is the probability of a single-nucleotide polymorphism for the nucleotide si at position i , calculated as: For each regulatory motif , P ( SNP|s ) was calculated for every instance of a motif match across all 3′ UTRs in the reference genomefor genes expressed in our samples , and the lower and upper bounds listed in Table S4 were taken as the minimum and maximum values of this distribution , respectively . For miRNA binding sites , only the 7-mer seed sequence was used . The DEFOG web-based tool ( http://www . mooneygroup . org/defog ) was used for Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis in Table S5 as follows . For each type of regulatory element analyzed in Figure 2C , we tabulated a list of class II genes with motifs in the shared region only , and combined these lists across elements . For each Gene Ontology term , we then evaluated the significance of the representation of genes annotated in the term in this list , relative to a background set of class II genes harboring at least one motif , using DEFOG with default parameters . Separately , we tabulated an analogous combined list of class II genes with motifs in the differential region only and repeated the DEFOG analysis . To find polymorphisms in 3′ UTRs across the six individuals of our sample , we generated mRNA-seq libraries [69] from one biological replicate of each cell line sample , and sequenced using 36 bp paired-end modules on an Illumina 2G Genome Analyzer , resulting in 21 to 24 million reads per sample . The sequenced reads were mapped to the human genome ( hg18 ) using MOSAIK ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) . Mapped reads ( 10 to 14 million per sample ) yielded an average coverage of 48% of UCSC annotated exons with an average depth of 27 reads/base for the covered bases . Mapped reads were used to call SNPs using GigaBayes ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) with options –ploidy diploid –O 3 –indel –CAL 10 . Only SNPs with a quality score higher than 0 . 99 were retained for analysis . This set of SNPs was used in association tests with total gene expression levels as follows . Given tag cluster definitions for each gene from analysis of 3′-end RNA-seq libraries ( see above ) , we calculated a normalized expression level for each tag cluster in each sample as the ratio between the number of 3′-end RNA-seq reads mapping within the tag cluster boundaries in the sample and the total number of mapped 3′-end RNA-seq reads in the sample . We then defined the expression level of a given gene in a given sample as the sum of all normalized expression levels across all tag clusters in that gene . To get a final estimate of gene expression level for use in association tests in Figure 3 and Figure 8 , we summed expression values across the two replicate samples from each cell line . For each SNP in the 3′ UTR of a gene , we identified the major allele across all cell lines and scored each diploid genotype in terms of the number of major alleles ( values ranging from 0 to 2 ) . Given the complete matrix of gene expression levels and genotypes across all six cell lines , we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient R between allele counts and the started logarithm of the gene expression level . For Figure 3A and Figure 8 , we used the absolute value of R as the association statistic , and for Figure 3B , we used the signed value of R . In cases of alternative polyadenylation , SNPs in polyadenylation signals upstream of a maximum of two major length forms were considered for association tests . To analyze the effect of genetic variation in polyadenylation signal strength on expression in Figure 3B , each allele of each polyadenylation signal was assigned a score: 1 if the signal was AATAAA or ATTAAA , 0 . 5 if the signal was a match to the “variant” polyadenylation motifs in [30] , and 0 otherwise . The polyadenylation signal strength difference was calculated by subtracting the strength of the minor allele from the major allele . In Figure 3A , we analyzed SNPs in 3′ UTRs for 4214 genes and SNPs in polyadenylation signals for 33 genes . In Figure 8 , we analyzed regulatory element SNPs in 62 , 16 , 7 , and 20 genes respectively in 3′ UTRs of class I genes , shared regions of 3′ UTRs of class II genes , differential regions of 3′ UTRs of class II genes whose long forms were more abundant , and differential regions of 3′ UTRs of class II genes whose short forms were more abundant . A psiCheck-2 vector ( Promega ) was modified to generate a 3′ UTR reporter vector , pOKY001 ( Figure S5 and Table S8 ) , in which we removed the SV40 late polyA signal from the firefly luciferase gene and replaced it with a tag for ligation independent cloning ( LIC ) [70] of 3′ UTR sequences of interest . Genomic DNA was isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines using the MasterPure DNA Purification Kit ( Epicentre ) , and 3′ UTR sequences were amplified from genomic DNA using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) with PCR primers with LIC tags . PCR products were cloned into pOKY001 using LIC , and plasmids were purified using Plasmid Midi Kit ( Qiagen ) . Site-directed mutagenesis of plasmids was performed using QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . All primers used for PCR and mutagenesis are listed in Table S7 . Cloned sequences of all reporter vectors were checked by capillary sequencing . The list of reporter vectors is provided in Table S8 . HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% non-essential amino acids in six-well culture plates . For each of two independent transfections for each construct , at 90% confluency , 1 µg of plasmid DNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . After incubating at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide for 24 h , the cells were washed with Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline ( DPBS ) , detached from plates by adding 300 µL of trypsin-EDTA and incubated at 37 degrees for 5 minutes . After adding 900 µL of media , the detached cells were split into three 2 mL tubes , and pelleted by spinning at 1000× g for 3 minutes . The cell pellets were washed with DPBS and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C . Given one cell pellet from each of two reporter transfections ( see above ) , cells from each pellet were lysed and used for two technical replicates of a dual luciferase assay using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) . Luminescence from the activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured sequentially in a Turner BioSystems Veritas Luminometer . The ratio of luminescence measurements between Firefly and Renilla luciferases was used for all analyses . To measure expression of short and long forms for a given gene with alternative polyadenylation , we considered quantitative PCR assays that would interrogate regions just upstream of the inferred cleavage sites of the short and long forms ( which we refer to below as SU and LU , respectively ) . We reasoned that expression measurements of SU would reflect abundance of both the short and long transcript forms , whereas LU would reflect abundance of the long form only . For a given transcript in a given experiment , the absolute mRNA level ( calculated from quantitative PCR reactions on a biological sample and standards , as described below ) from the primer set amplifying LU was used as the expression level for the long form; the expression level of the short form was calculated by subtracting the absolute mRNA level of LU from the absolute mRNA level of SU for all genes except IRF5 . Primer sequences for IRF5 were taken from [15] , where the primer set for SU hybridized to the polyA tail and only amplified the short form . Thus , for IRF5 , the mRNA count from SU was used as the expression level for the short form . All other primers were designed using Primer3 Plus [71] , checked for potential hairpins and primer dimers using BeaconDesigner Web Edition ( PREMIER Biosoft International ) . Primers were synthesized by Elim Biopharmaceuticals . For each transcript in each experiment , measurements were normalized by absolute mRNA counts of Renilla luciferase or GAPDH genes . All primer sequences are in Table S7 . Expression measurements on cells transfected with 3′ UTR reporters were performed as follows . Given one cell pellet from each of two transfections ( see above ) , total RNA was isolated from each pellet separately using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) . For each sample , genomic DNA was removed from 10 µg of total RNA using TurboDNase ( Ambion ) . Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of DNased RNA using oligo ( dT ) ( Invitrogen ) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) , and then RNA was removed using RNase H ( Invitrogen ) . For each of two technical replicates for each primer set and sample , the cDNA was amplified using the DyNamo HS SYBR Green QPCR Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) for 40 cycles on a Strategene MX3000P qPCR instrument . We calculated absolute numbers of mRNA molecules amplified from each primer set in each experiment by comparing the number of amplification cycles taken to reach a given threshold against a standard curve constructed using samples of a synthetic template ( gBlocks Gene Fragments , Integrated DNA Technologies ) of known absolute numbers of molecules , in serial dilutions extending from 107 to 101 molecules . Reporters incorporating 3′ processing signals were constructed as follows . For each length form of each gene , we aimed to clone a region centered on the cleavage site as inferred from the transcript end position observed in 3′-end RNA-seq , bounded by the 40 bp upstream and 40 bp downstream in the genomic sequences and flanked by LIC tags ( region sequences for EIF2A , IRF5 , DIP2B , and NAB1 were taken from the haplotype giving rise to production of both long and short forms for cell lines GM17220 , GM10860 , GM10860 , and GM17220 respectively ) . This 115-bp construct was produced by PCR stitching two opposite-strand DNA oligos of 60 bp and 78 bp ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) with 23 bp overlap using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) for 3 cycles . PCR products were cloned into pOKY001 and purified as described above . Transfection and dual luciferase assay were performed as above . For each transcript half-life measurement , cells transfected with a luciferase reporter harboring the complete 3′ UTR from the haplotype giving rise to production of both long and short forms of a given gene were incubated at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide for ∼24 h . A stock solution of actinomycin D dissolved in DMSO was added to achieve a final actinomycin D concentration in tissue culture media of 10 µg/mL . After incubation times as indicated in Figure 5 and Figure S4 , cells were harvested for quantitative PCR measurements as above or Northern blotting as described below . To generate expression vectors for ARE-binding proteins , the tristetraprolin ( gene name ZFP36 ) coding sequence was amplified from the vector pGFP-TTP and the AUF1 p37 coding sequence from pCDEF-His-AUF1-p37 ( both kind gifts from B . Glaunsinger ) . Each gene was cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector ( Invitrogen ) . Syn-has-miR-101 , a miRNA mimic of has-miR-101 , was purchased from Qiagen ( MSY0000099 ) . For dose-response assays , expression vectors or miRNA mimic were mixed with the corresponding luciferase reporter vectors ( Figure 6 ) and then transfected as above . Lipopolysaccharide from E . coli K12 ( Invivogen ) was added to each of the human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines GM10860 , GM17106 , and , GM17207 to a final concentration of 5 µg/mL in 6-well tissue culture plates , and incubated at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide . The cells were harvested after 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , and 16 hours by centrifuging at 1000× g for 3 minutes , washing with DPBS , and then flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen . RNA was isolated using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) . The DIG Northern Starter Kit ( Roche ) was used for Northern blotting . A 400 bp region of firefly luciferase gene was amplified from luciferase reporter vector pOKY001 , and cloned into pcDNA3 vector ( Invitrogen ) . A digoxigenin ( DIG ) labeled RNA probe for firefly luciferase was created by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase after linearizing the plasmid with BamHI . Total RNA isolated using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) was cleaned using RNeasy columns ( Qiagen ) with on-column DNase-digestion . Between 1 and 10 µg of total RNA was loaded and run on 1% denaturing agarose gels . The gels were stained with SYBR Gold ( Invitrogen ) and then the separated RNA was blotted onto nylon membranes ( Roche ) and UV cross-linked . Both the gels and the membranes were imaged on Blue Light Transilluminator ( Invitrogen ) to check the transfer of SYBR-stained RNA . 28S ribosomal RNA bands on the membranes were used as the loading control in Figure S4 . Each membrane was subjected to prehybridization , probe hybridization , low and high stringency washing , and detection procedures recommended by the manufacturer ( Roche ) . Anti-digoxigenin-AP ( Roche ) and CDP-Star ( Roche ) were used for chemiluminescent detection of the DIG-labeled RNA probe . To maximize length resolution for EIF2A , total RNA was incubated at 37°C for 30 min with RNaseH ( Invitrogen ) and an oligo antisense to a 20 bp region upstream of the binding site for the Northern probe in the firefly gene . For DIP2B , the denaturing agarose gel was treated with 0 . 05% NaOH and washed with water before blotting onto the nylon membrane .

       "      <td>Gene expression varies widely between individuals of a population , and regulatory change can underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical relevance . A key question in the field is how DNA sequence variants impact gene expression , with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence . By contrast , the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown , owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3′ untranslated regions . In this work , we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals . Our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ gene ends , finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements , including miRNA sites . The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals , and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay . Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation .</td>\n",
       "      <td>The expression of genes within a population is different for every individual. These differences can be due to changes in gene regulation. It is important to understand how these changes occur, and how they are related to gene expression. Most research on this topic has focused on the effects of genetic changes on the regions of DNA that control gene expression. However, less is known about the role of RNA processing in regulating gene expression. This is because it is difficult to identify functional elements in the regions of DNA that are not translated into proteins. In this study, researchers conducted an analysis of the ends of RNA molecules in lymphoblastoid cells from different human individuals. They found that the positions of these ends were not randomly located, but rather preferred to be close to certain regions of DNA that control gene expression. The usage of different RNA length forms and motifs in these regions varied across different individuals, and genetic changes in these regions were significant predictors of the expression levels of the genes. Independent experiments confirmed that genetic changes in these regions affected the expression levels of the genes. The researchers also looked at the gene IRF5, and how natural genetic variations in RNA processing affected the regulation of this gene in response to antigen stimulation. The researchers found that two mechanisms are at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of different 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate. The researchers suggest that the strategy of combining observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will be a useful tool in efforts to understand the human genome.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Annually , more than two million people are infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . Due to the ability of the virus to escape host immune responses , designing a successful HIV vaccine has been elusive . Similar to HIV in humans , rhesus macaques can be infected with SIV , a close relative and ancestor of HIV , resulting in simian AIDS . SIVΔnef , a live attenuated form of SIV , protects rhesus macaques from subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIV and is widely viewed as the most effective SIV vaccine . Here , we demonstrate that after vaccination of macaques with SIVΔnef , the immune response initially targets more variable regions of the virus , which the virus rapidly escapes . However , as the virus escapes , the immune response evolves to target more conserved regions of the virus as well as escape variants . This refocused targeting of conserved regions by the immune response provides a new mechanistic model that contributes to our understanding of how SIVΔnef vaccination protects animals from pathogenic challenge with SIV . Our findings also reinforce the importance of developing HIV vaccines that target conserved regions of the virus as well as their potential variants .</td>\n",
       "      <td>The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design . \\n Two decades ago , a report described a cohort of rhesus macaques infected with the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) , SIVΔnef , and subsequently protected from pathogenic wild-type SIV challenge [1] . Since then , numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of SIVΔnef-induced protection , ranging from complete protection with sterilizing immunity to partial protection with two or more logs reduction in peak and set-point viremia [2–6] . Remarkably , presumably in part due to the replication of SIVΔnef in mucosal sites [7] , robust protection has been also been documented following mucosal challenges [3–5] . SIVΔnef has also induced significant protection against heterologous challenge , albeit less effectively than against homologous challenge [4 , 5] . However , studies describing disease progression in SIVΔnef-vaccinated infant macaques and a subset of adult non-human primates precluded live attenuated HIV from being developed as a vaccine in human subjects [8–10] . Due to concerns over safety , research on SIVΔnef and related LASIV vaccines has shifted from safety-and-efficacy determination to mechanism-of-action delineation . As the most effective lentiviral vaccine , SIVΔnef has been extensively studied in order to shed light on the correlates of vaccine-mediated protection . However , no immunological correlate or mode of action has consistently been identified as being responsible for protection against pathogenic challenge . SIVΔnef generates a diverse SIV-specific antibody response [11 , 12] and macaques vaccinated with the related attenuated virus SIVΔ3 and lacking the Mamu-A*01 MHC I allele show effective control of pathogenic viral challenge despite CD8 T cell depletion [13] , implying that humoral immunity may play a significant role , at least in some genotypic backgrounds . Innate immunity has also been implicated as a correlate of SIVΔnef-induced protection [3] . SIVΔnef infection induces potent CD8 T cell responses similar in magnitude to wild-type SIV infection [14] , and multiple studies have implicated SIV-specific CD8 T cells in the protection induced by SIVΔnef [4–6 , 15] . Most recently , Fukazawa et al . [6] correlated the magnitude of lymph node SIV-specific T cell responses with protection elicited by a range of different LASIV strains , including SIVΔnef . Finally , studies in a related vaccine challenge model involving vaccination with an attenuated SHIV strain have implicated SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses in the female reproductive tract as playing a crucial role in protection [16] . In this work , we sought to scrutinize the interplay of the attenuated virus and the immune response at a high resolution . We chose to focus on the CD8 T cell response as the most likely immune correlate for protection given that previous studies have demonstrated: potent anti-lentiviral activity of CD8 T cells in vitro [17–21]; increased viremia during chronic SIV infection after CD8 T cell depletion [22]; the ability of a live attenuated SHIV vaccine containing HIV env to protect vaccinated macaques against SIVmac239 challenge [16 , 23]; SIVΔnef-mediated protection of animals challenged with wild-type SIVmac239 containing highly heterologous env sequences [24]; and a correlation between increased LASIV-induced protection and higher magnitude of SIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lymph nodes of vaccinated animals [6] . A distinguishing feature of the SIVΔnef and SIVΔ3 vaccines is the gradual increase in protection against wild-type SIV challenge during the first 15–20 weeks of vaccination [2 , 25] . Given the low-level replication rate of SIVΔnef after initial control of viremia by 8–12 weeks after vaccination , it was unknown whether SIVΔnef undergoes sequence evolution after acute infection . The only previously documented sequence evolution of SIVΔnef was in the Tat SL8 epitope , which escaped as early as 3 weeks post-infection [26] . We hypothesized that , despite low levels of viral replication , SIVΔnef undergoes sequence evolution during the vaccination period , which would induce a shift in the specificity of the CD8 T cell response between week 5 , when the animals are not protected , and week 20 , where increased protection plateaus [12] . We made use of high-throughput deep sequencing to quantify SIVΔnef sequence variants and their frequencies in vaccinated animals , including those with undetectable plasma viral loads . Concurrently , we fine-mapped the CD8 T cell responses at the epitope level at week 5 and 20 post-vaccination . Studying this cohort of animals longitudinally after SIVΔnef vaccination , we demonstrate concomitant coevolution of the virus and the specificity of the CD8 T cell response , resulting in a CD8 T cell repertoire with increased anentropic specificity , wider cumulative breadth , rearranged immunodominance and enhanced depth . \\n The animals included in this study were all female Indian-origin rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) , housed in a biocontainment facility at the New England Primate Research Center ( NEPRC ) . These experiments and procedures were approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals . At approval of the study , the assigned protocol number by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) was 04383 . The Harvard Medical School animal management program is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care , International ( AAALAC ) , and meets National Institutes of Health standards as set forth in the 8th edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [27] . The institution also accepts as mandatory the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Awardee Institutions and NIH Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing , Research , and Training . There is on file with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare ( OLAW ) an approved Assurance of Compliance ( A3431-01 ) . All animals were housed indoors in an SOP-driven , AAALAC-accredited facility . Husbandry and care met the guidance of the Animal Welfare Regulations , OLAW reporting and the standards set forth in The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . All research animals were enrolled in the NEPRC behavioral management program , including an IACUC-approved plan for Environmental Enrichment for research primates . This program included regular behavioral assessments , and provision of species appropriate manipulanda , and foraging opportunities . This protocol had an IACUC-approved exemption from social housing based on scientific justification . Primary enclosures consisted of stainless steel primate caging provided by a commercial vendor . Animal body weights and cage dimensions were regularly monitored . Overall dimensions of primary enclosures ( floor area and height ) met the specifications of The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and the Animal Welfare Regulations ( AWR's ) . Further , all primary enclosures were sanitized every 14 days at a minimum , in compliance with AWRs . Secondary enclosures ( room level ) met specifications of The Guide with respect to temperature , humidity , lighting and noise level . The animals were provided ad lib access to municipal source water , offered commercial monkey chow twice daily , and offered fresh produce a minimum of three times weekly . Light cycle was controlled at 12/12 hours daily . The animals were subject to twice daily documented observations by trained animal care and veterinary staff , and enrolled in the facility's environmental enrichment , and preventative health care programs . Euthanasia took place at defined experimental endpoints using protocols consistent with the American Veterinary Medical Association ( AVMA ) guidelines . Animals were first sedated with intramuscular ketamine hydrochloride at 20 mg/kg body followed by sodium pentobarbital ( ≥100 mg/kg ) intravenously to achieve euthanasia . To determine SIV protein-specific T cell responses , 9 whole protein peptide pools were constructed containing 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids at 2 . 5 μg/ml for each . Peptides spanning the SIVmac239 proteome and corresponding to the peptide sequences available from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH , were synthesized by the Massachusetts General Hospital core peptide facility . The sequence of individual peptides can be found at www . aidsreagent . org . For epitope mapping , a three-dimensional peptide matrix was constructed . The matrix was composed of 87 peptide pools , each containing around 27 to 30 peptides . The 87 peptide pools encompassed the entire SIV proteome with a coverage of 3-fold , such that each of the 823 overlapping peptides spanning the SIVmac239 proteome was represented in 3 different pools . The peptides used for epitope mapping were 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids and were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH . The sequence of individual peptides can be found at www . aidsreagent . org . The entropy for each epitope within SIVmac239 was determined by calculating the entropy of each 9-amino-acid window within SIVmac239 , which was determined by aligning 10 proteomes of SIVsmm , the ancestral virus of both the clonal SIVmac239 and the quasi-species SIVmac251 . The aligned proteome sequences were then uploaded into the Shannon Entropy-One calculator from the Los Alamos National Database ( http://www . hiv . lanl . gov/content/sequence/ENTROPY/entropy_one . html ) . The program calculates an entropy score for each 9 amino acid sequence in the SIVsmm proteome . In order to detect only IFN-γ-producing CD8 T cells , ELISPOT assays were carried out with PBMCs or lymph node mononuclear cells ( LNMC ) after negative selection of CD4 T-lymphocyte populations fractionated by magnetic bead separation ( CD4 Dynabeads; Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) as previously described [20] . Negatively selected CD4 T cells were &gt;90% CD8 T cells . CD4 T cell-depleted PBMC and LNMC were suspended in R-10 medium and used the same day in ELISPOT assays . Isolated lymph node CD4 T cells were pelleted and used for RNA extraction and cell-associated viral RNA quantitation and sequencing . For quantitation of plasma viral loads in SIVΔnef-infected animals , highly specific , real-time RT-PCR assays were performed as described previously [28] . The assay specific for SIVmac239Δnef was developed by designing a reverse primer that uniquely recognizes the sequence generated by the deletion of nef coding sequences in SIVmac239 . The nominal threshold for this assay was 30 viral RNA copy equivalents/ml plasma . To sequence lymph node cell-associated viral RNA , cell-associated viral loads were first determined , incorporating qPCR assay primers and probes for SIV gag , rhesus CCR5 and SIVmac239Δnef as described [28] . Briefly , pelleted cells were rapidly disrupted in 100 μl lysis/digestion solution ( 3M GuHCl , 50 mM TrisCl , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml Proteinase K ) , utilizing a Branson 450 sonifier equipped with a high-intensity cup horn and set at 60% power amplitude ( Branson Ultrasonics , Danbury , CT ) . After continued digestion at 42°C for 1 hour , 400 μl of GuSCN/carrier solution ( ~5 . 7 M GuSCN , 50 mM TrisCl , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM EDTA , 600 μg/ml glycogen ) was added to completely dissociate RNA-protein complexes . Total nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of 500 μl isopropanol , collected by centrifugation , and washed with 70% ethanol . This precipitate was air-dried , suspended in 60 μl 1X TurboDNAse buffer ( ThermoFisher/Ambion ) , and split into 2 equal 30 μl aliquots for separate RNA and DNA preparation . The samples for DNA determinations were denatured by heating to 100°C for 5 min and quenched on ice prior to qPCR . Associated with determinations of SIVmac239Δnef DNA , cell equivalents based on qPCR for rhesus CCR5 at single haploid copy per genome ( 2 copy equivalents per cell ) were determined on aliquots diluted 1:10 with 5 mM TrisCl , pH 9 . 0 . Copy equivalents of SIVgag and SIVmac239Δnef targets were determined as described [28] . For the aliquots reserved for RNA , 20 μl of a cocktail containing 2 μl ( 4 Units ) TurboDNAseI in 1X buffer ( ThermoFisher/Ambion ) were added to each , and the samples incubated at 42°C for 30 min to digest DNA . After digestion , RNA was recovered by addition of 200 μl of GuSCN solution without glycogen carrier , followed by precipitation with 250 μl isopropanol and a 70% ethanol wash , as noted above . Genome equivalents based on SIV gag or SIVmac239Δnef target sequences were determined as described . The threshold limits of detection for both SIV DNA and SIV RNA were 30 total copies of SIV sequence normalized to calculated cell equivalents . Plasma samples were spun at 14 , 000 rpm at 4°C for 1 hour in a microcentrifuge . Viral RNA was then isolated using the Qiamp MinElute Virus spin kit according to manufacturer’s instructions . Plasma viral RNA and cell-associated viral RNA ( isolated and quantitated as described above ) were reverse transcribed and amplified using 4 sets of primers to produce 4 overlapping amplicons spanning the entire length of the viral coding sequence using the SuperScript III High Fidelity One-Step RT-PCR kit ( Invitrogen , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . PCR products were either purified with the Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction ( Qiagen ) kit or Agencourt AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter ) . Samples were quantified with the Quant-IT dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Invitrogen ) The four resultant amplicons were combined and then libraries were created and tagged using the Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit ( Illumina ) . Individually tagged libraries were quantified with the Quant-IT dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Invitrogen ) and the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . Libraries were then pooled together , denatured with NaOH , and run on an Illumina MiSeq using either a 300 or 500 cycle MiSeq Kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . IFN-γ-producing T-cell responses were enumerated using an enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay for detection of macaque IFN-γ ( Mabtech , Mariemont , OH ) . CD4-depleted PBMC and LN mononuclear cells were stimulated at 2x105 cells per well with peptide pools ( 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids at 2 . 5 μg/ml each ) . Cells were incubated overnight in multiscreen plates ( Millipore ) coated with an IFN-γ capture antibody , and spots representing IFN-γ-producing T cells were detected in an enzyme-linked , colorimetric assay for bound IFN-γ . Spots were counted using an automated ELISPOT plate reader ( Zellnet Consulting , New York , NY ) . For epitope mapping , peptide-pool-stimulated wells , containing a number of spots 3 times higher than background and greater than 30 spots per million mononuclear cells , were selected for second round deconvolution . To deconvolute peptide-specific CD8 T cell responses , peripheral and lymph node mononuclear cells , depleted of CD4 T cells , were stimulated with single peptides that were present in at least 2 positive pools of the 87 peptide pools . Wells with responses to single peptides 3 times higher than background and greater than 60 spots per million were considered significant . Comprehensive MHC I typing using pyrosequencing was conducted as described [29] . Total cellular RNAs were converted to cDNA using a Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen ) . Primary cDNA-PCR amplicons spanning 190 bp of exon two of macaque class I sequences were generated with high-fidelity Phusion polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . Each PCR primer contained one of 12 distinct 10 bp MID tags along with adaptor sequences for 454 pyrosequencing . After purification , primary amplicons were normalized to equimolar concentrations and groups of 12 animals were pooled for GS FLX analysis . The emulsion PCR and pyrosequencing steps were performed with Genome Sequencer FLX instruments ( Roche/454 Life Sciences ) using GS FLX protocols according to the manufacturer’s specifications ( 454 Life Sciences ) at the 454 Sequencing Center ( Branford , CT ) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign High-Throughput Sequencing Center . Surface staining was carried out by standard procedures for our laboratory as described [30] . Except where noted , all reagents were obtained from BD Biosciences ( San Diego , CA ) and included monoclonal antibodies to the following molecules: CD3 ( clone SP34-2 , APC-Cy7 conjugate ) CD4 ( clone SK3 , PerCP-Cy5 . 5 conjugate ) , CD8α ( clone RPA-T8 , Alexa700 conjugate ) , CD28 ( clone CD28 . 2 , PE-Texas Red conjugate , Beckman-Coulter , Fullerton , CA ) , CCR7 ( clone 150503 , Pacific Blue conjugate , custom ) , KI-67 ( clone EH12 . 2H7 , PE conjugate , custom ) , CD127 ( clone R34 . 34 , PE conjugate , Beckman-Coulter ) , perforin ( clone Pf-344 , FITC conjugate , Mabtech , Mariemont , OH ) . Intracellular staining for perforin and KI-67 expression was performed using Caltag Fix &amp; Perm ( Invitrogen , Camarillo , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol . Enumeration of SIV-specific cells using PE- or APC-conjugated tetramers to Mamu-A*01 Gag181–189CM9 and Tat28–35SL8 ( kindly provided by Nancy Wilson and David Watkins , Wisconsin National Primate Research Center , Madison Wisconsin ) was performed as described previously [31] . All acquisitions were made on an LSR II ( BD Biosciences ) and analyses were done using FlowJo software ( Tree Star Inc . , Ashland , OR ) . Isotype-matched controls and/or fluorescence-minus-one ( FMO ) controls were included in all assays [32] . All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism software ( GraphPad Software v6 . 0b , Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Non-parametric Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis where the sample size was less than 6 . Otherwise , parametric t tests were conducted; p values less than 0 . 05 were assumed to be significant in all analyses . \\n To study the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response following vaccination with SIVΔnef , we first assessed the extent of viral sequence variation in 12 animals after SIVΔnef infection using next generation sequencing ( NGS ) . The vaccinated animals , most of which displayed classical SIVΔnef viral replication kinetics of peak viremia at week 2 and viral set-points at or near undetectable levels ( &lt;30 copy Eq/ml ) at week 8 , were followed for 20 to 40 weeks before challenge ( Fig . 1A ) . Plasma viral samples from the 12 vaccinated animals were sequenced at time points ranging from 1 week to 34 weeks post-vaccination . RT-PCR was used to create four overlapping amplicons corresponding to the full-length SIV viral genome . Libraries were prepared from the pool of four amplicons and then sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform . Although there was already widespread sequence variation during the first 2 weeks after vaccination with SIVΔnef , none of the variants in any of the animals sequenced exceeded a threshold of 10% ( Figs . 1C and S1 ) , suggesting that these variants were not subject to significant selection in vivo during this initial observation period . However , by week 4 post-vaccination , as the viral load declined from peak viremia , there was a significant increase in the prevalence of nonsynonymous mutations that exceeded the 10% threshold . At this time point , plasma viral RNA samples from 12 animals displayed an average of 8 nonsynonymous mutations , each with a greater frequency than 10% ( Figs . 1C and S2 ) . To determine if sequence variation continued to increase between weeks 4 and 20 , plasma viral RNA was sequenced from the 3 macaques with detectable viremia at week 20 . Plasma viral RNA samples from these 3 animals at week 20 had an average of 28 nonsynonymous mutations with a frequency greater than 10% , a marked increase compared to an average of 8 nonsynonymous mutations at week 4 ( Figs . 1C and S3 ) . To determine the extent of sequence evolution in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals that had lower levels of plasma viremia , we analyzed lymph node CD4 T cell-associated viral RNA at week 20 from 3 animals . Follicular helper CD4 T cells , which are localized in secondary lymphoid tissues , are preferentially infected by SIVΔnef [33] , and therefore have higher cell-associated viral RNA levels than CD4 T cells in peripheral blood [6] . Sequencing of lymph node CD4 T cell-associated viral RNA at week 20 revealed increased viral sequence variation even in SIVΔnef-infected animals with undetectable plasma viremia , albeit at lower levels of variation than observed for viremic animals . Lymph node associated viral RNA sequenced from animals with undetectable plasma viremia had an average of 15 nonsynonymous mutations with a greater frequency than 10% ( Fig . 1D ) , a substantial increase over the 8 nonsynonymous mutations at week 4 for these animals ( S2 Fig . ) . SIVΔnef was longitudinally sequenced in 5 animals , from plasma virus at week 4 and either plasma virus or LN CD4 T cell-associated virus at week 20 . Pooling all the variants ( greater than 10% frequency ) for all 5 animals , the average frequency of nonsynonymous mutations increased from 29% at week 4 to 47% at week 20 ( p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Moreover , there was a significant accumulation in the number of nonsynonymous mutations , increasing from an average of 10 nonsynonymous mutations per animal at week 4 to an average of 24 at week 20 ( p = 0 . 031 ) ( Fig . 1E ) . In all animals whose virus was sequenced , there was extensive sequence evolution as measured by the number of nonsynonymous mutations and their frequencies , including in animals with undetectable plasma viral loads . To determine if viral sequence evolution was accompanied by a shift in the epitopes targeted by the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response , we analyzed CD8 T cell responses at weeks 5 and 20 in the 12 vaccinated animals using IFN-γ ELISPOT assays using overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire SIV proteome . In contrast to increased protection between weeks 5 and 20 , there was a 40% decrease in the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) between weeks 5 and 20 ( Fig . 2A ) . Similarly , the breadth of the CD8 T cell response did not correlate with increased protection between weeks 5 and 20 , as the number of positive pools remained stable , with an average of 6 stimulating pools detected at week 5 and an average of 5 . 2 pools detected at week 20 in PBMCs ( Fig . 2B ) . A recent report demonstrated that the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes at week 50 post-vaccination with SIVΔnef correlated with protection against intravenous challenge [6] . To determine if the kinetics of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes ( LN ) correlated with the increased protection observed between weeks 5 and 20 , we looked at the magnitude and the breadth of the SIV-specific CD8+ T cell response in lymph nodes . Similar to the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response observed in peripheral blood , the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes decreased modestly , by 25% , between weeks 5 and 20 ( Fig . 2C ) . The breadth of the response , as defined by recognition of peptide pools of 30 peptides each , in the lymph nodes was likewise comparable to the breadth of the response in the periphery ( Fig . 2C ) , with a slight decrease from 5 positive pools at week 5 to 4 positive pools at week 20 . We next examined CD8 T cell responses to Gag and Pol , the two most conserved proteins in lentiviruses , as a fraction of total responses to the SIV proteome , an indicator of the level of conservation of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response . Intriguingly , there was a significant enrichment of the ratio of the magnitude of Gag and Pol responses to the total SIV-specific CD8 T cell response between weeks 5 and 20 in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals ( p = &lt;0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 2D ) . The ratio of Gag and Pol responses to total SIV responses increased in every animal between week 5 and week 20 , increasing from an average of 28% at week 5 to 47% at week 20 . To characterize the shift in CD8 T cell specificity at the level of individual epitopes , we mapped the CD8 T cell response to single peptides for 6 animals at weeks 5 and 20 post-vaccination with SIVΔnef . Epitope mapping of SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses was conducted on CD8 T cells from lymph nodes . For the 2 animals whose SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses were mapped in both lymph nodes and peripheral blood , there was no significant difference in the epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell responses in these two sites ( S1 Table ) . Longitudinal epitope mapping in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals revealed a change in the relative immunodominance of recognized epitopes between weeks 5 and 20 after SIVΔnef vaccination . Furthermore , the specific SIV epitopes recognized by CD8 T cell responses differed significantly between week 5 and week 20 . Of the 36 CD8 T cell epitopes mapped in the 6 animals at week 20 , only 14 were also recognized at week 5 ( Figs . 3A and S4 ) . Almost two thirds of the responses at week 20 are de novo responses or were not readily detectible at week 5 . As a first step in assessing whether these shifts in epitope specificity reflected increased anentropic specificity of the CD8 T cell response , we examined the conservation of targeted epitopes at different times after SIVΔnef vaccination . We assigned every mapped epitope a conservation score by calculating the mean entropy of nine amino acid stretches for all SIV proteins , as determined from the alignment of 10 SIVsmm predicted open reading frames ( Fig . 4 ) . SIVsmm strains were chosen because the virus clone SIVmac239 and the quasispecies SIVmac251 are derived from SIVsmm . Interestingly , in 5 out of 6 animals , the immunodominant response targeted a more conserved epitope ( lower entropy score ) at week 20 than at week 5 ( p = 0 . 039 ) ( Fig . 3B ) . Moreover , 7 of the de novo CD8 T cell responses detected at week 20 targeted highly conserved epitopes with an entropy lower than 0 . 1 . Having established the accumulation of sequence variants between weeks 5 and 20 and a simultaneous shift in the SIV epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell response , we sought to determine whether the two events were causally related . Overlaying epitopes mapped onto the sequenced virus from the 6 animals vaccinated with SIVΔnef demonstrated that there was a high concordance between the occurrence of nonsynonymous mutations and identification of CD8 T cell epitopes . In macaque 225–97 , for which we have the most comprehensive set of viral sequence data and longitudinal epitope mapping , almost all of the nonsynonymous mutations ( 7 out of 9 mutations ) with a frequency greater than 50% fell within a mapped CD8 T cell epitope ( Fig . 5A ) , implying a causal link between CD8 T cell pressure and viral escape . Moreover , the nonsynonymous mutations and mapped epitopes not only overlapped spatially but also overlapped temporally . In animals 225–97 and 256–00 , epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses declined in frequency following escape of the epitope ( Fig . 5B ) . Remarkably , escape epitopes in animal 225–97 were themselves overtaken by other epitope variants over time , suggesting CD8 T cell pressure on the escape epitopes as well ( Fig . 5C ) . However , we did not observe sequence variation in all identified CD8 T cell epitopes . As expected , we observed a strong bias favoring the escape of responses targeting highly variable epitopes , as determined by calculated entropy scores . An analysis of the top four responses mapped for each animal at weeks 5 , 20 and 40 after SIVΔnef vaccination demonstrated that the escaped epitopes had significantly higher entropy scores than targeted epitopes that did not escape ( p = 0 . 0013 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . Similarly , SIV-specific CD8 T cells can be grouped into maintained responses , which target mostly conserved regions , and waning responses that target escaped epitopes . The magnitude of the variable responses , defined as targeting epitopes with an entropy above 0 . 25 , decreased significantly between weeks 5 and 20 ( p = . 0101 ) and between weeks 5 and 40 ( p = . 0449 ) , whereas the magnitude of the conserved responses was maintained ( Fig . 6B ) . To determine if the selective escape of variable epitopes , coupled with the decline of their CD8 T cell response frequencies , led to an immune response that was increasingly focused on more conserved epitopes , we developed a formula that estimates the conservation level of the immune response . The Response Conservation Index is the sum of all SIV-specific CD8 T cell response frequencies , weighted for entropy . The Response Conservation Index was calculated for every animal at both week 5 and 20 using the formula in Fig . 7 . Importantly , in the six animals whose CD8 T cell responses were mapped , the Response Conservation Index increased significantly between weeks 5 and 20 ( p = 0 . 0156 ) ( Fig . 7 ) . To ascertain that the increased targeting of conserved epitopes in the vaccinated animals was not due to a genetic background enriched for protective MHC I molecules , we conducted comprehensive pyrosequencing of MHC I genotypes in the six animals whose CD8 T cell responses were longitudinally mapped . The cohort displayed a diverse set of MHC I molecules with three animals expressing the protective alleles Mamu-A*01 and Mamu-B*17 , while the rest of the animals did not express any protective MHC I alleles ( Table 1 ) . Notably , increased anentropic specificity was documented in every animal between weeks 5 and 20 regardless of the MHC I background ( Fig . 7 ) . The number of epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell response did not differ between weeks 5 and 20 , as measured by positive peptide pools ( Fig . 2B , 2C ) or the specific mapped epitopes ( Fig . 8A ) . However , we hypothesized that escaped CD8 T cell responses were not deleted but rather maintained as a central memory T cell pool and , therefore , that the cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell repertoire , encompassing all previously detected responses in a given animal , may be a more accurate measure of SIV-specific CD8 T cell breadth ( Fig . 8B ) . Phenotypic analysis of SL8-specific CD8 T cells , targeting the highly mutable SL8 epitope , did reveal a shift to a central memory profile between weeks 5 and 20 , characterized by increased cell surface expression of CD28 ( p = 0 . 0087 ) , CCR7 ( p = 0 . 0006 ) and CD127 ( p&lt;0 . 0001 ) , as well as a decrease in intracellular expression of perforin ( p&lt;0 . 0001 ) and Ki67 ( p = 0 . 0194 ) ( Fig . 8C ) . In Mamu-A1*001+ ( previously known as Mamu-A*01 ) animals , SL8-specific CD8 T cell responses are frequently immunodominant during acute infection but quickly decline following the evolution of escape variants , where 82% and 94% of sequenced SL8 epitopes had mutated as early as week 4 in two SIVΔnef-vaccinated macaques ( Fig . 8D ) . Although SL8-specific CD8 T cells reached nearly undetectable levels by week 20 as measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT and SL8-MHC tetramer staining , the responses rebounded in both animals following challenge with SIVmac251 ( Fig . 8D ) . Given the maintenance of responses to escaped epitopes in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals , all escaped responses were included in the calculation of cumulative breadth . In contrast to CD8 T cell breadth , the cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response increased significantly from an average of 6 responses per animal at week 5 to an average of 10 responses at week 20 ( p = 0 . 0036 ) ( Fig . 8B ) . Finally , SIVΔnef escape , in addition to allowing for anentropic specificity and increased cumulative breadth , contributes to the deepening of the CD8 T cell response . In macaque 256–00 , the mapped Mamu-B17-restricted FW9 ( FHEAVQAVW ) epitope was intact at week 5 but the virus fully escaped by week 20 with 99 . 9% of sequenced reads containing the FW9-H831Y variant . To determine if de novo CD8 T cell responses to the escape variant arose , we tested both variants at week 5 and at the latest time point before challenge , week 38 . Lymph node CD8 T cells from macaque 256–00 recognized FW9 at week 5 but not at week 38; conversely , the FW9-H831Y escape variant was recognized only at week 38 but not at week 5 ( Fig . 9A ) . Similarly , the GY9-K76R epitope variant was recognized at week 38 but not at week 5 demonstrates increased depth of the CD8 T cell response after the escape of the mapped Mamu-A*02-restricted GY9 ( GSENLKSLY ) epitope ( Fig . 9B ) . These data demonstrate that , at least in a subset of SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals , the depth of the CD8 T cell response increased between weeks 5 and 20 as new CD8 T cell responses were mounted against escape variants . \\n Taken together , this data set supports a comprehensive model that provides new insights into the mechanism of SIV-specific immunity maturation after SIVΔnef vaccination . For the first time , we demonstrate that SIVΔnef sequence evolution is widespread after vaccination , not just confined to the previously documented highly mutable epitope of Tat SL8 [26] , and that ongoing sequence evolution occurs even in animals with undetectable plasma viremia . Moreover , we show that the observed sequence evolution can be characterized as viral epitope escape , a consequence of SIV-specific CD8 T cell pressure on the virus as indicated by the many nonsynonymous mutations that appear within mapped CD8 T cell epitopes . Importantly , another direct consequence of immune CTL pressure is the disproportionate escape of highly variable epitopes , which leads to the waning of CD8 T cell responses targeting entropic epitopes and the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses specific for these epitopes . In addition , escaped SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and , as such , contribute to the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 post-vaccination with SIVΔnef . Finally , epitope escape and the ensuing generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to these escape variants constitute a deepening of the CD8 T cell repertoire . Our work sheds new light on SIVΔnef and other LASIV vaccines and how their functional and mechanistic characteristics are fundamentally different from other vaccines . While many of the recent successful replication competent virus vector-based vaccines such as CMV and RRV are also persistent [34–37] , we demonstrate that SIVΔnef is not only a persistent vaccine but that , as a lentivirus , it evolves with the immune response it induces and , ultimately , shapes the CD8 T cell response during the vaccination period . This unique characteristic of SIVΔnef to mutate allows for maturation of CTL specificity through increased targeting of conserved regions , deepening and broadening of the response . Furthermore , this new model accommodates earlier known properties of LASIV , such as the observation that the level of protection of LASIV vaccines inversely correlates with the level of attenuation of the vaccine [6 , 38] . Based on our current work , we hypothesize that LASIV vaccine efficacy depends on virus evolution , resulting in the concurrent CD8 T cell specificity shift from highly variable to conserved regions of the virus . Highly attenuated viruses , such as SIVΔ4 , which exhibits lower efficacy compared to SIVΔnef [38] , would have lower replication rates and less escape events , therefore less opportunity to shape the CD8 T cell response . Despite three decades of HIV research , basic questions of vaccine design remain hotly debated , namely the optimal balance of CD8 T cell response magnitude , breadth and specificity that should be induced by a vaccine . In suggesting that anentropic specificity is a more important correlate of protection in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals than response magnitude , our data corroborates previous work on long-term nonprogressors ( LTNP ) , another important model of spontaneous lentiviral suppression . Research on LTNP has shown that MHC I molecules associated with protection restrict CD8 T cells that target regions within HIV Gag [39 , 40] as well as highly conserved epitopes [41] . However , unlike viral control in LTNP , which is associated with certain protective HLA molecules , we document increased targeting of highly conserved epitopes in all animals regardless of their MHC I genotypic background . Similar to our LASIV-induced protection , viral control in LTNP is correlated with the immunodominance of CD8 T cell responses that target highly conserved epitopes [42] , given that immunodominant CD8 T cells exert more immune pressure [41] . Finally , studies of LTNP revealed the importance of targeting conserved regions during acute infection [41] , before massive depletion of CD4 T cells has occurred [43] . Our research demonstrates that at week 20 , whereas responses to variable regions have waned , the immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells target more conserved epitopes than at week 5 . The presence of immunodominant CD8 T cells exerting pressure on highly conserved regions during acute infection in animals challenged at week 20 post-vaccination , but not at week 5 , could explain the observed difference in protection . Conversely , the absence of immunodominant responses targeting highly conserved regions in animals challenged at week 5 allows the virus to easily escape and the accumulation of anentropic-specific CD8 T cell responses would occur long after acute infection , if at all . In addition to immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells with anentropic specificity , we also show increased cumulative breadth and depth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 compared to week 5 . The increased cumulative breadth at week 20 is a function of waning escaped CD8 T cell responses that are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and are recalled upon challenge . It is unclear how effective these responses are at long-term viral suppression , given that they have been escaped and mostly target variable regions of the virus . Still , a recent report suggests that acute-phase SIV-specific CD8 T cells targeting variable regions are important for viral control [44] , indicating that the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 may also contribute to protection . Moreover , we detected de novo CD8 T cell responses specific to escaped epitope variants , illustrating that viral escape also contributes to increased immune response depth . Although LTNP generate HIV-specific CD8 T cells that cross-react with escape mutants [45] , the generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to escaped epitopes is rarely observed in adults infected with HIV [46] . In animal 256–00 , we identified two such CD8 T cell responses that target variant epitopes at week 38 but were not detectable at week 5 . We only assayed CD8 T cell responses against escape variants of known CD8 T cell epitopes with known MHC I restriction , and only if the MHC I is expressed by the infected animal . The relative frequency of de novo CD8 T cell responses in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals , if verified in future studies , could be due to an intact CD4 T cell compartment that persists well into the chronic phase of LASIV infection . Previous reports have documented rapid escape of variable epitopes during acute HIV-1 infection and maintenance of CD8 T cell responses specific for conserved epitopes into chronic infection [47–49] . Here , in the context of SIVΔnef , we demonstrate , in addition to rapid escape of variable epitopes and maintenance of existing CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity , de novo CD8 T cell responses against novel epitopes and escape variants during chronic infection . Furthermore , we correlate the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity and the increased repertoire depth and breadth to the kinetics of SIVΔnef vaccine-induced protection . Previous research on the coevolution of lentiviral epitopes and the CD8 T cell response has been conducted in the setting of wild-type infection , and it is unclear that our findings of increased anentropic specificity , cumulative breadth and repertoire depth during SIVΔnef vaccination would apply to wild-type lentiviral infection , in which the CD8 T cell response is likely to be impaired by the persistently high antigenic load , CD4 T cell depletion in the gut and microbial translocation-induced immune activation . Notably , we did not see an increased magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in the lymph nodes between weeks 5 and 20 . Fukazawa and colleagues [6] have recently shown that less attenuated LASIVs such as SIVΔnef have higher viral replication in the lymph nodes and , in turn , have higher lymph node CD8 T cell responses . Although these results corroborate existing data demonstrating that protection inversely correlates with LASIV attenuation [38] , our data demonstrates that the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response does not correlate with the kinetics of protection , neither in the PBMC nor lymph node compartment . Although our current work supports the importance of conserved responses as a correlate for protection , others have shown that using conserved regions as immunogens may result in a reduction of the total magnitude of responses [50] . It is unknown whether vaccines inducing targeted responses toward conserved regions will make up for the loss of magnitude . Still it is encouraging that we observe increased anentropic specificity in all animals , suggesting that even nonprotective MHC I molecules can target highly conserved epitopes if properly primed . It has also been proposed that the increased protection of LASIV vaccines is due to phenotypic maturation of the CD8 T cell response . It is important to delineate whether observed phenotypic changes in SIV-specific CD8 T cells correlate with LASIV protection and whether CD8 T cell phenotypic maturation is specific to LASIV or can be seen in other vaccines , such as adenovirus- , CMV- and RRV-based SIV vaccines . Finally , although this data set was focused on the CD8 T cell response and its evolution over time post-vaccination , we observed relatively few nonsynonymous mutations in env outside of mapped CD8 T cell epitopes , suggesting that antibody responses induced only modest immune selective pressure on SIVΔnef compared to CD8 T cell responses . Although immunodominance , specificity , breadth and depth have been implicated for some time as determinants of a successful CD8 T cell response against HIV/SIV infection , these results demonstrate how such a CD8 T cell response may be induced by the highly protective SIVΔnef vaccine . This new model of SIVΔnef-mediated protection raises obvious implications for vaccine design , namely that a successful vaccine should focus CD8 T cell responses on conserved regions of the virus and their existing variants . The recent success of viral vectors such as CMV [34–36] , RRV [37] , and adenovirus [51] to elicit potent CD8 T cell responses that partially protect rhesus macaques from infection has been an important step forward in vaccine design . However , these vaccines are all derived from DNA viruses , which have significantly lower rates of mutation than lentiviruses , and thus they are unlikely to shape the immune response in a similar fashion to SIVΔnef . Our work suggests that immunogens should be carefully chosen for these vectors such that the induced responses preferentially target conserved regions of the virus , as well as existing variants of these regions to increase response breadth and depth simultaneously .</td>\n",

       "      <td>The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design .</td>\n",
       "      <td>The SIVΔnef virus is one of the most effective vaccines in protecting against infection with wild-type lentiviruses. However, little is known about how this vaccine works. In this study, researchers used advanced technology to analyze the immune response of vaccinated animals. They found that the initial response was directed against regions of the virus that vary more widely, but as the virus evolved to escape the immune response, the response became more focused on regions of the virus that are highly conserved. This broadened the immune response to include more diverse regions of the virus, which is associated with better protection. These findings make SIVΔnef a useful model for researchers to study how vaccines can be designed to be more effective.</td>\n",

The cytokine interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) plays a critical role for antifungal host defense and was proposed to act by regulating neutrophil recruitment to the oral mucosa . However , although IL-17 can promote neutrophil trafficking in some situations , we recently showed in a mouse model that this is not the case during OPC .

Here , we demonstrate an essential role of IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling in the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation to the infected tissue via enhanced secretion of chemokines and increased output of neutrophils from the bone marrow . We found that IL-1α is released from keratinocytes upon invasion of C . albicans and acts on endothelial cells to induce the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , a key trigger of emergency granulopoiesis . Thereby , IL-1R signaling translates the local response to the fungus in the oral mucosa into a systemic response that critically contributes to protection from infection .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Mucosal infections with Candida albicans belong to the most frequent forms of fungal diseases . Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease . \\n The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide , particularly in immunocompromised individuals [1] . Of the diverse forms of disease manifestations , mucosal infections with C . albicans are by far most abundant [2] . The symptoms reach from mild forms of infection to chronic or recurrent diseases . No licensed fungal vaccines are currently available to prevent disease , and toxicity and resistance to available drugs compromise the effective management of patients . With the ever-increasing population of immunocompromised patients , C . albicans infections thus represent an important socio-economic challenge worldwide . The epithelium constitutes the first point of contact between the fungus and the host [3] . It provides an important physical barrier to prevent fungal invasion . Moreover , it has the capacity to sense and respond to the fungus . By producing inflammatory mediators and antifungal defense molecules the epithelium actively participates in the host response and together with leukocytes , including neutrophils and IL-17-producing lymphocytes , contributes to limiting fungal ( over ) growth . Diverse mutual interactions between leukocytes and the epithelium are critical for mounting a broadly protective response against C . albicans . The epithelium elicits signals in response to the fungus that can promote the inflammatory response [3] , while cytokines such as IL-17 , produced by leukocytes , act on the epithelium to enhance its barrier function and antimicrobial activity [4 , 5] . Neutrophils have been shown to rapidly accumulate in the oral mucosa in response to C . albicans infection , and they critically contribute to prevent invasion of the fungus in underlying tissues and dissemination to the circulation and visceral organs as was shown in a model of acute oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) [6 , 7] . The relevance of neutrophils in protection from oropharyngeal candidiasis is also evidenced by the high incidence of the disease in hemato-oncological patients with bone marrow aplasia [8 , 9] . Neutrophils comprise a major proportion of circulating peripheral blood leukocytes . They are generated from granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in the bone marrow under the control of granulopoietic growth factors , primarily granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) [10] . During acute infection , granulopoiesis is massively enhanced to comply with the increased demand for neutrophils in host defense [11] . Control mechanisms of this demand-adapted hematopoiesis involve long-distance regulatory feedback loops induced at the site of infection where neutrophils act , which is usually distant from the production site of neutrophils in the bone marrow . Increased release of G-CSF in response to infectious and/or inflammatory insult plays a key role in this process [11] . Given the potentially harmful effects of dysregulated neutrophils , granulopoiesis and neutrophil trafficking is under tight control and regulated in a tissue-specific manner [12] . With the discovery of interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) and the realization of its critical role in defense against mucocutaneous candidiasis [5 , 13] , it was postulated that IL-17 mediates protection by promoting the neutrophil response . Indeed , IL-17 signaling can enhance expression of neutrophil cytopoietic and chemotactic factors in response to C . albicans [14] . However , we recently demonstrated that neutrophils are recruited normally to the site of infection in IL-17 receptor-deficient mice , thus that the IL-17 pathway is not required for the neutrophil response during OPC [6] . Therefore , although neutrophil trafficking may be regulated by IL-17 in some tissues and in response to certain pathogens [15–19]—this is not the case during C . albicans infection in the oral mucosa . Alternative candidate factors regulating the neutrophil response include IL-1 . In fact , secretion of both IL-1α and IL-1β are efficiently induced in dendritic cells and macrophages when stimulated with C . albicans [20–23] and both IL-1 family members were shown to contribute to protection from systemic infection [24] . Epithelial cells also secrete IL-1 cytokines when triggered with C . albicans [25–27] , although in mice , unlike in humans , keratinocytes produce only IL-1α but no IL-1β [28] . Whether and how IL-1 cytokines contribute to antifungal defense in barrier tissues remains poorly defined . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis , we found that IL-1R signaling is critical for host defense by regulating the neutrophil response . We show here that IL-1 acts by two complementary mechanisms . First , it regulates the production of neutrophil-chemotactic factors by epithelial cells for the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulating pool to the site of infection . Second , it induces G-CSF production by the endothelium for enhanced neutrophil output from the bone marrow to meet the increased demand in response to infection . Release of IL-1α from keratinocytes upon contact with C . albicans is critical for mediating this crosstalk between the epithelium and the endothelium in the oral mucosa . \\n Infection of mice with C . albicans via the oropharyngeal route induces a rapid inflammatory response , characterized by a massive recruitment of neutrophils to the oral mucosa ( Fig 1A , S1 Fig ) [6 , 7 , 29] , which accumulate in proximity to where C . albicans hyphae invade the keratinocyte barrier on the dorsal and ventral side of the tongue [6] . Following from our previous findings that neutrophil trafficking during OPC was independent of the IL-17 pathway [6] , we sought after factors responsible for controlling neutrophil recruitment in response to C . albicans . We found that mice lacking the IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) recruited significantly less neutrophils to the site of infection than their wild type ( WT ) counterparts ( Fig 1B ) . In consequence Il1r1-/- mice were unable to control the fungus and displayed an increased fungal load in the tongue on day 3 post-infection ( Fig 1C ) . These data indicated clearly that IL-1R signaling was critical for the neutrophil response during OPC . The rapid accumulation of neutrophils in the oral mucosa of infected mice was paralleled by a strong induction of the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines CXCL1 , CXCL2 and CXCL5 ( Fig 2A ) . Consistent with the role of IL-1 in neutrophil recruitment , chemokine expression in the oral epithelium was impaired in absence of IL-1R signaling ( Fig 2B ) , while basal levels were comparable ( S2 Fig ) . To determine the cellular compartment responsible for chemokine production , we sorted cellular subsets from the tongue of naïve and C . albicans-infected mice on day 1 post-infection , the peak of the neutrophil response , including CD45+ leukocytes , CD45- EpCAM+ CD31- keratinocytes and CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ endothelial cells ( S3 Fig ) and analyzed chemokine expression at the transcriptional level . The keratinocyte fraction displayed the highest RNA levels , and the induction in response to infection was most prominent in this population ( Fig 2C ) . Consistent with this result , a cell line of tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) also secreted neutrophil-attracting chemokines in an IL-1-dependent manner in vitro ( Fig 2D ) . These data suggested that the neutrophil response to OPC is initiated locally in the infected mucosa . While C . albicans may directly induce chemokine expression in keratinocytes , their production is strongly enhanced by IL-1R signaling . In addition to the strong induction of the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines during OPC , the expression of Csf3 , the gene coding for G-CSF , was also markedly induced in the infected oral mucosa ( Fig 3A ) , suggesting that it may contribute to the overall neutrophil response during OPC by boosting granulopoiesis and neutrophil egress from the bone marrow . We therefore analyzed typical surrogate hallmarks of emergency granulopoiesis in the bone marrow . While total numbers of CD45+ cells in the bone marrow were unchanged in infected mice compared to naïve controls ( Fig 3B ) , we observed a reduction in mature Ly6Ghi CD11b+ Ly6Cint neutrophils ( Fig 3C and 3D ) . This response was paralleled by an increase in Ly6Glo CD11b+ Ly6C- immature neutrophils ( Fig 3C and 3E ) . These reciprocal changes in mature and immature neutrophils in the bone marrow indicated that G-CSF , which was induced by the local infection with C . albicans , acted at a distance and thereby elicited a systemic response . Indeed , neutralization of G-CSF impaired the induction of emergency granulopoiesis during infection ( Fig 3F and 3G ) . The increased demand for neutrophils in the infected tissue was thus compensated by an increased rate of granulopoiesis and mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow . The increased neutrophil output from the bone marrow was relevant for the local antifungal response as indicated by the fact that depletion of the circulating neutrophil pool with an anti-Ly6G-specific antibody ( 1A8 ) was not sufficient to blunt the neutrophil response to C . albicans [6] . Instead , the combination of anti-Ly6G and anti-G-CSF was required for efficient depletion of neutrophils in the blood and in the infected tissue ( Fig 3H and 3I ) resulting in a total loss of fungal control ( Fig 3J ) . Note that the reduction of neutrophils by ~1 log ( Fig 3I ) resulted in a ~4-log increase in fungal load over a course of 3 days ( Fig 3J ) , while the ~0 . 5 log reduction in neutrophils in absence of IL-1 signaling ( Fig 1B ) lead to a ~2-log increase in fungal load over the same period of time ( Fig 1C ) . Given the prominent role of G-CSF for the overall neutrophil response during OPC we wanted to understand the regulation of this growth factor in more detail . For this , we isolated again CD45+ leukocytes , CD45- EpCAM+ CD31- keratinocytes , and CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ endothelial cells from the tongue of C . albicans-infected mice and uninfected controls as above ( S3 Fig ) and analyzed Csf3 transcript levels in each population . Surprisingly , the most prominent expression was observed in the endothelial cell population ( Fig 4A ) . Although keratinocytes were previously shown to secrete G-CSF in response to C . albicans in vitro [26] , their contribution in vivo was minor ( Fig 4A ) . Similarly , leukocytes expressed only very low levels of G-CSF during OPC ( Fig 4A ) . To corroborate this unexpected finding , we examined G-CSF protein production by the different cell subsets . Because we were unable to visualize intracellular G-CSF by flow cytometry , we prepared cell lysates from sort-purified tongue cell populations and quantified their G-CSF content by ELISA . Again , by far the highest production of G-CSF was detected in the endothelial cell fraction isolated from infected mice ( Fig 4B ) . Further separation of the CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ population in podoplanin-positive and podoplanin-negative subsets confirmed that blood endothelial cells rather than lymph endothelial cells were responsible for G-CSF production during OPC ( S4 Fig ) . Production of G-CSF by endothelial cells was supported by the observation that high levels of G-CSF could be detected in the serum of infected mice ( Fig 4C ) . Together , these data suggested that G-CSF , which is induced in response to local infection with C . albicans , acts at a distance to promote granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization in the bone marrow and thereby sustains a systemic neutrophil response that meets the increased demand of these cells during OPC . Next , we investigated how G-CSF secretion by endothelial cells is regulated during OPC . Direct stimulation of endothelial cells by C . albicans appeared unlikely given their spatial distribution in the oral mucosa . We made use of VE-cadherin-cre x ROSA26-RFP reporter mice [30] to visualize the blood and lymphatic vessels in situ and infected them with GFP-expressing C . albicans ( Fig 5A ) . In immunocompetent animals , fungal hyphae were restricted to the avascular tongue epithelium without penetrating the basal epithelial layers . The absence of direct contacts of C . albicans with endothelial cells suggested that G-CSF production was regulated indirectly . Given the important role of IL-1 for the overall neutrophil response to C . albicans , we assessed the IL-1 dependence of G-CSF during OPC . The induction of Csf3 transcripts was less pronounced in the oral mucosa of Il1r1-/- mice ( Fig 5B ) , while basal levels were unchanged ( S2 Fig ) . Likewise , G-CSF protein expression by endothelial cells that were sorted from infected tongues was drastically diminished in absence of IL-1R signaling ( Fig 5C ) . This translated in strongly diminished G-CSF levels in the serum of C . albicans-infected Il1r1-/- mice compared to WT controls ( Fig 5D ) . In contrast , TNF , which had been proposed to regulate G-CSF expression in vitro [31] , was not involved in G-CSF production during OPC ( S5 Fig ) . As a consequence of the G-CSF defect in Il1r1-/- mice , emergency granulopoiesis was strongly impaired during OPC in these mice , as indicated by the higher ratio of mature to immature neutrophils in the bone marrow of infected Il1r1-/- mice compared to WT controls ( Fig 5E and 5F ) . Importantly , Il1r1-/- mice responded to G-CSF treatment , and the administration of recombinant G-CSF was sufficient to fully overcome the defect in emergency granulopoiesis in these mice ( Fig 5G and 5H ) . Together , these data demonstrated , that G-CSF secretion during OPC was controlled by the IL-1 pathway . G-CSF production appeared to underlie a different regulatory mechanism compared to neutrophil chemokine production during OPC given their distinct cellular sources , despite the fact that both , chemokines and G-CSF , depended on IL-1R signaling . Next , we examined the expression of IL-1α and IL-1β , the two activating ligands of the IL-1R . Both were found strongly induced during OPC ( Fig 6A ) . IL-1α and IL-1β contribute to G-CSF production during OPC because the induction of G-CSF expression in the oral mucosa and its release into the serum were strongly impaired in absence of IL-1α or IL-1β ( Fig 6B and 6C ) . IL-1β was expressed predominantly by the hematopoietic compartment as assessed by flow cytometric analysis of intracellular pro-IL-1β ( S6 Fig ) . To determine the cellular source of IL-1α in the murine tongue , we applied an immunofluorescence approach , which allowed us to detect IL-1α with high specificity on tissue sections . Basal expression levels observed in the keratinized epithelium of the tongue in naïve mice were strongly enhanced upon infection ( Fig 6D ) . Co-staining with antibodies specific for keratinocytes of the tongue ( keratin-6 ) or those of stratum basale ( keratin-14 ) [32] revealed that IL-1α was predominantly produced by differentiated keratinocytes ( Fig 6E ) . Note that the IL-1α signal was absent in neutrophil-rich areas , which were identified by DAPI staining . The availability of preformed IL-1α ( but not IL-1β ) protein in steady-state ( Fig 6D , S6 Fig ) , which can be rapidly released in response to stimulation , together with the strategic position of keratinocytes as the first contact point between the host and the infecting fungus , suggested that keratinocyte-derived IL-1α likely functions as an ‘alarmin’ right at the onset of infection to alert the host about fungal invasion and to initiate a protective antifungal response . As such , keratinocyte-derived IL-1α may also act on endothelial cells and thereby contribute to the neutrophil response during OPC . To delineate the putative crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells in more detail , we made use of a newly generated cell line of mouse tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) ( S7 Fig ) . TDKs expressed high levels of EpCAM and keratin-6 indicating that they represented differentiated oral keratinocytes [32] . Their concurrent expression of keratin-14 was consistent with their origin of basal keratinocytes with stem cell properties . Consistent with published data with keratinocytes from other sources [26] , TDKs released IL-1α when stimulated with C . albicans ( Fig 7A ) . Notably , and in contrast to human keratinocytes [28] , mouse keratinocytes released no IL-1β ( Fig 7B ) . This response was dependent on live and hyphenating fungus because heat-killed or a yeast-locked C . albicans did not induce IL-1α ( Fig 7C ) . Likewise , IL-1α was not induced with zymosan , a yeast cell wall extract , or curdlan , a pure β-glucan preparation ( Fig 7A ) . Consistent with our in vivo data , the overall amount of IL-1α detected from TDKs in response to live C . albicans resulted from the release of preformed cytokine and de novo biosynthesis of IL-1α ( Fig 7D ) . Next , we tested the effect of TDKs and TDK-derived IL-1α on endothelial cells for G-CSF induction ( Fig 8A ) . For this , we employed an established endothelial cell line , MS1 [33] . TDKs and MS1 cells both did not produce G-CSF when directly stimulated with C . albicans nor with curdlan or zymosan , although they responded strongly to LPS , which was included as a positive control ( Fig 8B and 8C ) . However , MS1 cells secreted high amounts of G-CSF when stimulated with the sterile-filtered supernatant of C . albicans-stimulated TDKs ( Fig 8D ) . This response was dose-dependent ( Fig 8E ) and only observed when TDKs were stimulated with life and hyphenating C . albicans , but not with heat-killed C . albicans , a yeast-locked strain of C . albicans or inert fungal cell wall components such as zymosan and β-glucan ( curdlan ) ( Fig 8D–8F ) . Similar results were obtained when supernatant of freshly isolated mouse oral keratinocytes stimulated with C . albicans was added to MS1 cells ( S8 Fig ) . This indicated that a C . albicans-induced TDK-derived soluble factor was responsible for G-CSF production by endothelial cells . To test whether this factor was IL-1α , we added anakinra ( IL-1R antagonist ) or a neutralizing anti-IL-1α antibody into the supernatant-transfer assay . This resulted in a complete abolishment of the response ( Fig 8G–8I ) , while adding an anti-IL-1β antibody had no effect on G-CSF induction by TDK-derived factors ( Fig 8I ) , consistent with the notion that IL-1β was not produced by murine keratinocytes ( Fig 7B ) . IL-1α was not only necessary but also sufficient for triggering G-CSF production in endothelial cells , because MS1 cells secreted large quantities of G-CSF when stimulated with recombinant IL-1α ( Fig 8J ) . In summary , these results revealed a novel IL-1α-dependent crosstalk between epithelial and endothelial cells that mediates the induction of G-CSF by C . albicans . In conclusion , our data corroborate the notion that the epithelium takes an active part in host defense in barrier tissue through its strategic location and by alerting the immune system about the presence of a pathogenic threat . By demonstrating the relevance of IL-1α release ( for G-CSF induction ) and chemokine secretion , we provided an example in a physiologically relevant system . \\n In this study , we describe an essential function of the IL-1 pathway in antifungal immunity in the murine oral mucosa . We demonstrated how IL-1R signaling regulates the neutrophil response against C . albicans in two ways to prevent fungal growth and dissemination . Specifically , it promotes the production of chemokines by oral keratinocytes for neutrophil recruitment from the circulating pool , and it induces G-CSF secretion from endothelial cells to enhance granulopoiesis in the bone marrow to meet the rapid demand for neutrophils in the tissue . IL-1R signaling thereby translates the local response to a tissue-specific infection into a systemic response . The availability of preformed IL-1α from keratinocytes , which are the first cells to be exposed to C . albicans during infection , is critical for the initiation of the response . Together , our data demonstrate how signaling through the IL-1R coordinates a cellular crosstalk between keratinocytes , endothelial cells and neutrophils for optimal control of C . albicans in the oral mucosa . Rapid infiltration of neutrophils to the site of infection is a hallmark of the inflammatory response to OPC and critical for the confinement of the fungus in the mucosal epithelium [6] . The neutrophil response in the oral mucosa was originally thought to be controlled by the IL-17 pathway , which itself is highly critical for fungal control during OPC [14] . However , previous work from our laboratory showed that the key protective function of IL-17 is uncoupled from the neutrophil response [6] . Although IL-17 signaling can enhance the expression of neutrophil chemokines and granulopoietic factors [14] , IL-17 is not required for neutrophil chemotaxis and function during OPC [6] . Instead , neutrophil trafficking to the oral mucosa during acute infection is under the control of IL-1R signaling as our data demonstrate . IL-1R deficiency is associated with impaired neutrophil recruitment and defective fungal control in response to OPC . Our data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating a role for IL-1R signaling in antifungal defense in different settings including systemic candidiasis [24] , a model of mixed oral and systemic candidiasis [34] , A . fumigatus keratitis [35] and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [36] . The mechanism of IL-1R-mediated protection , however , was not addressed in most of these studies . Here , we used the model of OPC to dissect the impact of IL-1R signaling on neutrophil mobilization and recruitment in response to C . albicans infection at a cellular and molecular level . Keratinocytes take center stage in the coordination of the IL-1-mediated neutrophil response during OPC . They act as the major producers of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines . Chemokine production by keratinocytes was greatly enhanced by IL-1R signaling and at least in part through the autocrine activity of IL-1α . A similar mechanism for enhanced chemokine secretion by keratinocytes was described before in the context of Staphylococcus aureus skin infection [37] . A second mechanism , by which keratinocytes promote the neutrophil response during OPC , is by the induction of G-CSF via their capacity to produce IL-1α . Our data thus link IL-1 signaling and G-CSF production . G-CSF regulates granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization in the bone marrow , which is critical to meet the rapidly increasing demand of neutrophils in the infected tissue . Administration of recombinant G-CSF in mice is sufficient to drive emergency granulopoiesis as we and others have shown [38] , and recombinant G-CSF is widely used therapeutically to treat neutropenia [39] . G-CSF has also been used successfully in the treatment of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis [40] . Besides its host-beneficial role in hematopoiesis and protection from infection , dysregulated production of G-CSF has been linked to autoinflammatory disorders such as psoriasis and inflammatory arthritis [41–43] and targeting G-CSF has been proposed as a therapeutic approach against these diseases [44] . We identified endothelial cells in the oral tissue to be the major producers of G-CSF during OPC , while we were unable to detect G-CSF expression by murine keratinocytes in response to C . albicans . Direct secretion of G-CSF into the bloodstream by endothelial cells facilitates its delivery to the distant bone marrow and the induction of a systemic response . During systemic bacterial infections , G-CSF production by the endothelium was shown to be a direct and TLR4-dependent response of the vasculature to endotoxin stimulation which lead to the induction of emergency granulopoiesis [38] . During OPC , we found no evidence for direct response of the endothelium to C . albicans , and endothelial cells were not activated by the fungus in vitro . Instead , G-CSF was produced as a result of an IL-1-dependent crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells . IL-1α was critical for the secretion of G-CSF into the circulation during OPC , and it was sufficient for stimulating G-CSF production by endothelial cells in culture , consistent with a published report [31] . In contrast , TNF , which was also reported to induce G-CSF production by endothelial cells in vitro [31] , did not regulate G-CSF production during OPC . In addition to IL-1α , IL-1β also contributes to the antifungal response in vivo and at least partially compensates in absence of IL-1α . IL-1β was also induced in the oral mucosa during infection . Consistent with the notion that murine keratinocytes are unable to produce IL-1β [28] , we found this cytokine to be expressed by the hematopoietic compartment . IL-1β induction in response to C . albicans was shown previously to depend on the NLRP3 inflammasome in different infection models [21 , 34 , 45] and NLRP3 was required in the hematopoietic compartment [29] . In addition to the NLRP3 inflammasome , the NLRC4 inflammasome was also shown to contribute to protection from OPC [29] . Whether its function at the level of the mucosal stroma is linked to the IL-1 pathway and whether it is involved in IL-1α production in keratinocytes was not addressed . We found that the overall IL-1α response resulted from the release of preformed and intracellularly stored IL-1α on the one hand , and from the induction of de novo synthesis on the other hand . The release of IL-1α from keratinocytes correlates with the induction of cell damage [46] , suggesting that IL-1α release may be a consequence of cell death induced by fungal invasion . It remains to be determined whether IL-1α secretion by oral keratinocytes in response to C . albicans infection depends on caspase-1 as was shown to be the case for bone marrow-derived MNPs differentiated with GM-CSF [20] . The dependence of IL-1α secretion on life and filamenting fungus is consistent with the implication of candidalysin in this process . This fungal peptide toxin has recently been identified as a critical virulence factor promoting epithelial cell damage and the release of cytoplasmic molecules , some of which may act as alarmins [47] . Importantly , our data demonstrate the biological relevance of keratinocyte-derived factors induced by C . albicans for the induction of inflammation and protection from infection in vivo , and they dissect the mechanism how IL-1 coordinates the neutrophil response against the fungus in the oral epithelium . \\n All mouse experiments described in this study were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Swiss Animal Protection Law and were performed under protocols approved by the Veterinary office of the Canton Zurich , Switzerland ( license number 201/2012 and 183/2015 ) . All efforts were made to minimize suffering and ensure the highest ethical and humane standards . WT C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Janvier Elevage . Il1a-/- mice ( a kind gift from Manfred Kopf ) [48] , Il1b-/- mice [48] ( a kind gift from Manfred Kopf and Hans-Dietmar Beer ) and Il1r1-/- mice [49] were bred at the Laboratory Animal Service Center ( University of Zürich , Switzerland ) . VE-cadherin-cre x ROSA26-RFP reporter mice [30] and Tnf-/- mice ( a kind gift from Annette Oxenius ) [50] were bred at the Rodent Center HCI at ETH Zürich . All mice were on the C57BL/6 background , kept in specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 6–15 weeks of age . For neutrophil depletion , mice were treated with anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 , BioXCell , 150μg per mouse i . p . on day -1 ) and/or anti-G-CSF ( clone 67604 , R&amp;D Systems , 10μg per mouse per day i . p . starting from day -1 ) , as indicated . For inhibition of emergency granulopoiesis , mice were treated with anti-G-CSF ( 10μg per mouse per day i . p . on day -1 and day 0 ) . For induction of emergency granulopoiesis , mice were injected with human recombinant G-CSF ( Filgrastim , Amgen , 5 μg/mouse i . p . at 5h and 17h post-infection ) . The C . albicans strain SC5314 was used for all experiments except where stated otherwise . The yeast-locked strain hgc1Δ/Δ and its revertant hgc1Δ/Δ:HGC1 [51] were obtained from N . Gow ( Aberdeen ) . The strain pACT1-GFP [52] was obtained from C . Reis e Sousa . All strains were grown in YPD medium at 30°C for 15–18 hours . Mice were infected with 2 . 5x106 cfu C . albicans sublingually as described [53] without immunosuppression . Mice were monitored for morbidity and euthanized in case they showed severe signs of pain or distress . For determination of fungal burden , the tongue of euthanized animals was removed , homogenized in sterile 0 . 05% NP40 in H2O for 3 minutes at 25 Hz using a Tissue Lyzer ( Qiagen ) and serial dilutions were plated on YPD agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin . The detection limit corresponds to one colony divided by the mean weight of the tongues in the experiment . For heat-killing 108 yeast cells were boiled for 45 minutes . Preformed hyphae were generated in keratinocyte medium at 37°C , 5% CO2 for 24 hours . Mice were anaesthetized with a sublethal dose of Ketamine ( 100 mg/kg ) , Xylazin ( 20 mg/kg ) and Acepromazin ( 2 . 9 mg/kg ) , and perfused by injection of PBS into the right heart ventricle prior to removing the tongue and/or the bones . Tongues were cut into fine pieces and digested with DNase I ( 200 μg/ml , Roche ) and Collagenase IV ( 4 . 8 mg/ml , Invitrogen ) in PBS at 37°C for 45–60 minutes . Single cell suspensions were passed through a 70 μm strainer using ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS and 2 mM EDTA and analyzed by flow cytometry ( see below ) . For intracellular cytokine staining , tongue leukocytes were enriched over a 40% percoll gradient before antibody staining and analysis . Bone marrow was flushed from femurs using PBS and passed through a 70 μm strainer using ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS and 2mM EDTA . Erythrocytes were lyzed using erythrocyte lysis buffer ( 0 . 3 M NH4Cl , 28 μM NaHCO3 , 125 μM EDTA ) , and leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry . Tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) were obtained from WT mice . The tongue was cut to obtain ventral and dorsal parts . The dorsal part of the tongue was freed from muscle tissue with a scalpel and floated on DMEM ( PAA ) containing 0 . 8% trypsin ( Thermo Fischer ) for 40 minutes with the epithelial side facing upwards . After incubation , the epithelial tissue was separated from the lamina propria , and keratinocytes were isolated by incubating in DMEM medium containing DNase I ( Roche , 200 μg/ml ) for 30 minutes and occasional vortexing and filtering through a 70 μm strainer . The cells were pelleted , resuspended in keratinocyte medium ( S1 Table , adapted from [54] ) and cultivated in cell culture plates coated with collagen ( Bornstein and Traub Type IV , Sigma Aldrich , 25μg/ml ) . The blood endothelial cell line MS1 [33] was kept in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FCS and Penicillin/Streptomycin . Prior to stimulation experiments , TDK and MS1 cells were rested for 48 hours and then stimulated with recombinant IL-1α ( Peprotech , 20 ng/ml ) , IL-1β ( Peprotech , 20 ng/ml ) , anakinra ( 250 μg/ml ) , zymosan ( 20 μg/ml ) , curdlan ( 200 μg/ml ) , LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) or C . albicans at MOI = 3 for 24 hours . Amphotericin B was added 8 hours post-stimulation where stated explicitly . Supernatants were collected for analysis . In some cases , cell lysates were generated by adding 0 . 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS to the supernatant-free cells . To determine the total amount of IL-1α in cells and supernatant , Triton-X 100 was added to separate culture wells at a final concentration of 0 . 1% . For supernatant transfer experiments , TDKs were stimulated for 24 hours as described , supernatants were removed , sterile-filtered and added to MS1 cells at a 1:3 dilution . G-CSF production by MS1 cells was determined by ELISA after 24 hours ( see below ) . In some experiments , TDK supernatants were treated with anti-IL-1α ( clone ALF-161 , BioXCell , 20 μg/ml ) and/or anti-IL-1β ( clone B122 , BioXCell , 20 μg/ml ) before they were added to MS1 cells , or MS1 cells were pretreated with anakinra for 30 minutes before addition of TDK supernatant . All antibodies were from BioLegend , if not stated otherwise . For flow cytometry analyses of neutrophils , single cell suspensions of tongues , bone marrow or blood were stained in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS , 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02% NaN3 with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain ( Life Technologies ) , anti-CD45 . 2 ( clone 104 ) , anti-CD11b ( clone M1/70 ) , anti-Ly6C ( clone AL-21 , BD Biosciences ) and anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 ) . For flow cytometry analyses of tongue keratinocytes and endothelial cells , single cell suspensions were stained in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS , 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02% NaN3 , with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain or 7AAD ( BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD45 . 2 ( clone 104 ) , anti-EpCAM ( clone G8 . 8 ) and anti-CD31 ( clone MEC13 . 3 ) . In some experiments , anti-podoplanin ( clone 8 . 1 . 1 ) was included . For intracellular cytokine staining , tongue cells were first incubated in LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain and surface marker antibodies . After fixation and permeabilization using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm ( BD Biosciences ) the cells were incubated in Perm/Wash buffer ( BD Biosciences ) containing anti-pro-IL-1β ( clone NJTEN3 ) or the respective isotype control antibody . Cells were acquired on a FACS LSRII ( BD Biosciences ) or on a FACS Gallios ( Becton Coulter ) , and data were analyzed with FlowJo software ( Tristar ) . For all experiments , the data were pre-gated on live single cells . For isolating tongue cell subsets by FACS sorting , single cell suspensions of five tongues were pooled , stained as described above , and sorted on a FACS AriaII ( BD Biosciences ) using FCS as a collection medium . Isolation of total RNA from bulk tongues or sorted cell populations was carried out according to standard protocols using Trizol Reagent ( Sigma ) or Trizol LS Reagent ( Life Technologies ) . cDNA was generated by RevertAid ( Thermo Scientific ) . Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green ( Roche ) and a Rotor-Gene 3000 ( Corbett Research ) or a QuantStudio 7 Flex ( LifeTechnologies ) . The primers were Actb fwd 5'-CCCTGAAGTACCCCATTGAAC-3' , Actb rev 5'-CTTTTCACGGTTGGCCTTAG-3'; Cxcl1 fwd 5'-CCGCTCGCTTTCTGTG-3' , Cxcl1 rev 5'-GCAGCTCATTGGCGATAG-3'; Cxcl2 fwd 5'-AGTGAACTGCGCTGTCAATGC-3' , Cxcl2 rev 5'-GCAAACTTTTTGACCGCCCT-3'; Cxcl5 fwd 5'- GAAAGCTAAGCGGAATGCAC-3' , Cxcl5 rev 5'-GGGACAATGGTTTCCCTTTT-3'; Csf3 fwd 5'-CTTAAGTCCCTGGAGCAAGTG-3' , Csf3 rev GTGGCCCAGCAACACCAG; Il1a fwd 5'-GGGAAGATTCTGAAGAAGAG-3' , Il1a rev 5'-TAACAGGATATTTAGAGTCG-3'; Il1b fwd 5'-TACAGGCTCCGAGATGAACA-3' , Il1b rev 5'-AGGCCACAGGTATTTTGTCG-3' . All qPCR assays were performed in duplicate and the relative gene expression ( rel . expr . ) of each gene was determined after normalization with β-actin transcript levels . For the preparation of cell lysates from sorted tongue cell populations , Brefeldin A ( 250 μg / mouse ) was injected i . p . 6 hours before removal of the tongue tissue . Brefeldin A was also added during the antibody staining and supplemented in the collection medium during cell sorting . Sorted cells were washed with PBS , and 400’000 cells of each population ( 60’000 for naïve leukocytes , 25’000 for LECs ) were lysed in 100 μl 0 . 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS containing cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) using a Tissue Lyzer ( Qiagen ) for 3 minutes at 25 Hz . The G-CSF content of the lysates was analyzed immediately by ELISA ( see below ) . G-CSF protein in the serum , in cell lysates or in cell culture supernatants was determined by sandwich ELISA using purified anti-G-CSF ( clone 67604 , R&amp;D Systems ) for coating and biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-G-CSF ( Peprotech ) for detection according to standard protocols . For determination of IL-1α and IL-1β levels in cell culture supernatants , cytometric bead array assays ( BD Biosciences ) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The detection limits are indicated by a dotted line . Tongues were embedded in OCT ( Sakura ) , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C . For immunofluorescence staining , sagittal cryosections ( 9 μm ) , were fixed with acetone for 10 minutes at room temperature and stained with anti-IL-1α ( clone ALF-161 , BioXCell ) , anti-K6 ( BioLegend , poly19057 ) , anti-K14 ( BioLegend , poly19053 ) and 4′ , 6’-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI , Sigma-Aldrich ) . Slides were mounted with Mowiol ( VWR International AG ) , scanned with a NanoZoomer 2 . 0 HT ( Hamamatsu Photonics K . K . ) using 10x and 20x objectives , and analyzed using NDP . scan 2 . 5 . 88 . All scale bars indicate 100 μm . For whole mount confocal microscopy , tongues were longitudinally cut with a scalpel and fresh tissue was placed on 35mm microscopy dishes ( IBIDI ) with PBS . Z stack tile scans were acquired with an SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a 20x APO objective ( 0 . 7 N . A . ) covering large areas of the tongue tissue . 3D maximum projections and mosaic reconstructions of the acquired data were generated with IMARIS ( Bitplane ) . Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction , one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparison test , or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test where appropriate using GraphPad Prism software with * , p &lt; 0 . 05; ** , p &lt; 0 . 01; *** , p &lt; 0 . 001; **** p &lt; 0 . 0001 .

       "      <td>Mucosal infections with Candida albicans belong to the most frequent forms of fungal diseases . Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Candida albicans causes mucosal infections, which are one of the most common forms of fungal diseases. The immune system protects against these infections, but we do not know how to induce immunity against them. We used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) to study this. We found that the immune response is regulated by a molecule called interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R). IL-1R is important for controlling fungal growth at the beginning of the infection. This happens because IL-1R affects neutrophils in two ways: it helps neutrophils reach the site of the infection and it helps new neutrophils be made in the bone marrow. IL-1R-deficient mice had problems controlling fungal growth because they did not produce enough of a molecule called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and they did not make enough of a molecule called chemokines. G-CSF is made by endothelial cells, which are a type of cell found in the mouth. Chemokines are made by keratinocytes, which are another type of cell found in the mouth. Keratinocytes release IL-1α, which is important for G-CSF production by endothelial cells. We confirmed these findings in vitro using a new type of mouse cell called a keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. Together, these data show that IL-1R is important for regulating the immune response to fungal infections in the mouth and for protecting the host from these infections.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) , commonly known as ‘elephantiasis’ , is one of the world's most debilitating infectious diseases . In 83 countries worldwide , more than 1 . 3 billion people are at risk of infection with an estimated 120 million individuals already infected . A recent publication reviewing the health impact of the first 8 years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) demonstrated the enormous health benefits achieved in populations receiving annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) , as a result of infection prevented , disease progression halted , and ancillary treatment of co-infections . To date , however , no studies have estimated the economic value of these health benefits , either to the individuals or the societies afflicted with LF . Our study estimates that US$21 . 8 billion will be gained among individuals benefitting from just the first 8 years of the Global Programme , and an additional US$2 . 2 billion will be saved by the health systems of endemic countries . Treating endemic populations is possible at very low cost – particularly because of the generous drug donations from two pharmaceutical companies – but results in enormous economic benefits . Findings from this study yield a much clearer understanding the GPELF's full economic impact and strengthen the conviction that it is a ‘best buy’ in global health .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Between 2000–2007 , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1 . 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs ( albendazole , ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine ) to all at-risk for 4–6 years . Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health . \\n As a leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide , the parasitic infection lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) imposes a severe physical and socioeconomic burden on 1 . 3 billion at-risk persons in 83 endemic countries . An estimated 120 million people are already infected with LF , with about 40 million suffering from overt clinical disease manifested as painful severe swelling due to lymphedema ( generally an accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the limbs ) and hydrocele ( fluid accumulation in the scrotal sac ) . To rid the world of this debilitating disease , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) was begun in 2000 to guide endemic countries in implementing single-dose , once-yearly mass drug administration ( MDA ) using a combination of either albendazole+ivermectin or albendazole+diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) for an anticipated 4–6 years . Use of this effective strategy for LF elimination has become feasible because of the drug donations of albendazole and ivermectin from their pharmaceutical manufacturers , GlaxoSmithKline and Merck &amp; Co . , Inc , respectively . Over the first 8 operational years of the GPELF ( 2000–2007 ) , more than 1 . 9 billion MDA treatments were administered to approximately 570 million individuals in 48 countries . This significant programmatic achievement has resulted in a notably beneficial impact on the health of endemic populations [1] . More than 6 million cases of hydrocele and 4 million cases of lymphedema have been prevented , resulting in over 32 million disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs ) averted and numerous quality-of-life benefits attained . What remains relatively undefined , however , is the economic significance of these achievements . Specifically , how much financial cost and loss of income is prevented over the lifetimes of individuals protected from LF due to the first 8 years of the GPELF ? And , what cost savings do national health systems realize from the reduction in LF infection and morbidity ? To date , few attempts have been made to examine LF from an economic perspective , particularly on a global level . Such data , however , is invaluable to policymakers , public health administrators , and program funders who may already be convinced that LF is a ‘best buy’ in global health but who lack precise estimates to support their conviction . This study offers such an economic analysis and estimates that following the first 8 years of the GPELF , US$21 . 8 billion of economic benefits will be gained by LF infected and non-infected individuals in MDA-treated areas , in addition to US$2 . 2 billion in health systems savings . Furthermore , though this economic assessment has not included the value of the many ancillary benefits on other concurrent infections that are effectively treated by the anti-LF drug regimens , it still leads to a far better understanding of the GPELF's true overall impact on one of society's most debilitating and widespread tropical diseases . \\n Key data sources are listed below , though specific sources are cited throughout the paper: For this analysis , two broad groups of individuals are recognized as economically benefitting from the MDA treatment given during the first 8 years of the GPELF: Those protected from acquiring infection ( and subsequent disease [specifically , hydrocele and/or lymphedema] ) ; Those already infected but protected from disease progression . These two groups can be segmented into four sub-populations ( detailed below and summarized in Table 1 ) ; together , they constitute the “benefit cohort population” . Population estimates for each sub-population were calculated using the same base figures and key assumptions as described previously [1]; namely that 10% of the at-risk population is actually infected with LF , that this ratio would remain constant in the absence of MDA , and that the relative frequency of the clinical disease syndromes will also remain stable among those infected individuals . The previous section defined a 4-part benefit cohort population as the group of protected individuals who will realize economic benefits as a result of MDA activity between 2000–2007 . The total economic impact of the GPELF , however , extends over a much longer period than these first 8 years because protection from LF infection or disease progression is a lifelong benefit . It is therefore necessary to aggregate the total economic benefit gained over the projected remaining lifetime of the benefit cohort population . To estimate this total , a general formula ( Figure 1 ) was applied and calculated independently for each country to accommodate country specific differences in several key variables ( life expectancy , mortality rate , direct and indirect costs ) . All calculated costs and benefits are discounted to the base year of 2008 . For this study , 2008 was used as the base year for calculating economic benefits . When calculating future benefits , however , it is necessary to discount values to a net present value ( NPV ) under the economic principle that a dollar earned in the present is worth more than one earned in the future . Therefore , all annual accumulated cost savings beyond 2008 are discounted at 3% per year in accordance to guidelines set by WHO-CHOICE [53] . GPELF program costs can be compared with the economic benefits calculated in this study through a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the efficiency and practicality of implementing the Global Programme . Estimating program costs , however , is not the intent of this study and such data was , therefore , sourced through our previously published work [54] . On a macro-level , no study has yet been conducted to estimate the total cost of the GPELF over its first 8 years and as a result , a broader programmatic cost-benefit analysis cannot be calculated . It is possible , however , to estimate the cost-benefit on an individual-level using per person costs calculated in a multi-country study of national MDA program costs for LF including training , mapping , mobilization , distribution , monitoring , and surveillance [54] . In this study , Goldman et al . analyzed both the average annual economic cost per person treated ( i . e . including the implied costs of donated materials and drugs – set at US$0 . 19+$0 . 0019 for shipping per 400mg tablet of albendazole and US$1 . 50+$0 . 0018 per 3mg tablet of ivermectin ) and also the financial cost per person treated ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) from data collected through questionnaires and adjusted for LF-specific activities . Donated ivermectin is used in combination with donated albendazole in areas co-endemic for onchocerciasis in Africa plus Yemen . DEC , which is not donated , is used in combination with donated albendazole in all other countries and must be purchased by national programs . In terms of per person economic benefits , the total economic benefits estimated over one year in this study was divided by the total number of people treated with MDA in that same year . For this analysis , per person economic benefits were only calculated for the 7 countries whose program costs were also evaluated in Goldman et al . 's study . Cost-benefit was then measured using benefit-cost ratios ( BCR ) , which is the per person treated benefit divided by the per person treated cost . For standardization purposes , the BCR reflects costs , benefits , and currencies adjusted to the year of the most recent MDA round in Goldman et al . 's study . \\n During the first 8 years of LF MDA , the Global Programme delivered nearly 2 billion treatments and reached almost 570 million individuals in 48 of the 83 identified endemic countries ( Table 4 ) . As a result of these program achievements , 31 . 4 million individuals – defined in this study as the benefit cohort population – will gain economic benefits over their lifetime from averting direct treatment costs and indirect lost-labor costs . Of these 31 . 4 million individuals in the benefit cohort population , 2 . 7 million ( 8 . 6% ) would have acquired LF and subsequently progressed to clinical disease but were protected from infection altogether because of interruption of the transmission cycle by MDA . This group comprises the proportion of newborns ( 2 . 2 million ) that are protected by virtue of being born in MDA-treated areas , as well as other individuals in the general population ( 0 . 5 million ) protected because LF transmission has been interrupted . The remaining 28 . 7 million ( 91 . 4% ) individuals are those who were already infected at the time of MDA treatment but benefit from halted disease progression . This population group comprises individuals at the subclinical disease stage ( 9 . 4 million , [29 . 9%] ) who avoid clinical disease altogether and individuals at the clinical disease stage ( 19 . 3 million [61 . 6%] ) whose conditions may improve following MDA . As seen in Table 5 , the efforts in reaching and administering MDA to such a large population have produced extraordinary economic benefits over the first 8 years of the GPELF . An estimated US$21 . 8 billion will be saved over the lifetimes of the 31 . 4 million individuals who have or would have acquired clinical disease during this timeframe . This total amount results from summing the direct treatment costs ( $1 . 4b ) and indirect lost wages ( $20 . 4b ) prevented over the lifetime of each of the population groups under the assumptions and estimates previously outlined in Table 3 . Direct costs for acute disease were calculated based on the aggregate number of ADL episodes expected in the absence of MDA and the average cost incurred per episode . Chronic disease direct costs were derived from the percentage and total number of patients seeking treatment multiplied by the average cost spent per treatment . Indirect costs for both acute and chronic disease were calculated by accruing the equivalent workdays lost to LF and multiplying this total by the average daily wage . All average costs and rate of disease estimates were weighted annually by country-specific estimates and with respect to total number of person-years . On average , each individual of the benefit cohort population will avoid nearly $700 in LF-associated costs that would have accrued over his/her lifetime . This equates to the amount earned for 19 working days per person-year , thus preventing the loss of approximately 6 . 3% of annual income ( Table 6 ) . These sums and averages are even greater when considered in a single year-to-year perspective , since beyond 2008 , each year of economic benefit is discounted by 3% per year . Table 6 also shows that the infected patient sub-population groups ( i . e . clinical and subclinical ) have the greatest total lifetime benefits based on their larger proportion of the total benefit cohort population . On a per person lifetime average , however , subclinical ( Group 2a ) and ‘other protected individuals’ ( Group 1b ) benefits are larger . Figure 3 highlights the total economic benefit segmented by cost , morbidity , and clinical presentation . Economic benefits to national health systems resulting from reduced LF infections derive particularly from patient service costs averted in the public sector . Approximately US$2 . 2 billion in health system costs will be saved over the lifetime of the benefit cohort population ( Table 8 ) . Combined with the US$21 . 8 billion savings for individuals , the total economic benefit following the first 8 years of the GPELF is estimated at an extraordinary US$24 . 0 billion ( Figure 4 ) . This overall economic analysis of the GPELF's first 8 years does have notable limitations due to the lack of regionalized primary data concerning both epidemiological and socioeconomic factors associated with LF . Indeed , two sections of the model remain with particular uncertainty: 1 ) The degree to which MDA can reverse or return an individual with overt clinical disease to regular productivity , and 2 ) The relationship between hours lost and output/productivity lost due to disease . The total estimated economic impact is particularly sensitive to these variables because of the large number of clinical disease patients receiving MDA and the high proportion of total prevented costs that come from indirect labor costs . As a result , sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the range of economic benefits that can be achieved under varying estimates of each variable . Secondary sensitivity analyses investigating the frequency and duration of ADL episodes , and direct treatment costs indicated less variability of economic benefits when adjusting these parameters . Goldman et al . found the average annual economic cost per person treated ( i . e . including the implied costs of donated materials and drugs – set at US$0 . 19+$0 . 0019 for shipping per 400mg tablet of albendazole and US$1 . 50+$0 . 0018 per 3mg tablet of ivermectin ) ranged from US$0 . 40 in Philippines to $5 . 82 in Tanzania . The average annual financial cost per person treated ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) ranged from US$0 . 06 in Burkina Faso to US$1 . 34 in Haiti [54] . One-year economic benefits per person treated in this study ranged from US$1 . 00 in Burkina Faso to US$4 . 56 in the Dominican Republic . Table 10 compares these economic benefit estimates with the economic and financial costs from Goldman et al . 's study to calculate country-specific BCRs . The economic cost BCR for the three African countries using the ivermectin+albendazole regimen are lower ( 0 . 21–0 . 37 ) than those in countries using DEC+albendazole ( 1 . 23–8 . 59 ) . Since the drugs , however , are available at no cost to the GPELF , BCRs calculated using financial costs are more favorable , ranging from 1 . 64 in Egypt to 18 . 07 in the Philippines . \\n In Table 10 , the BCRs calculated with economic costs are low , particularly for the African countries using the ivermectin+albendazole regimen . In reality , however , the whole foundation of the GPELF is the long-term , sustained commitment of drug donations offered by GlaxoSmithKline for albendazole and Merck &amp; Co . , Inc . for ivermectin for as long as needed until LF is eliminated [72] , [73] . Because of this commitment , governments and donors will never have to finance these costs themselves; indeed , without these commitments there would be no GPELF . Therefore , understanding the financial costs ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) to the GPELF is more relevant for policy- and decision-making than is the analysis of economic costs . When comparing financial costs to economic benefits , then , Table 10 shows very favorable BCRs , including up to 18 . 07 in the Philippines . Whether examining financial or economic costs , the BCR becomes larger in the years beyond the recommended 5 rounds of MDA to achieve lifetime protection from LF . The Goldman et al . study [54] showed strong evidence that costs decrease after the initial year of implementation and after 5 rounds of MDA , the drug costs and majority of program activities would arguably subside dramatically as well . In the Philippines for example , by conservatively extrapolating the initial year's annual economic cost over 5 years , the cost to lifetime benefit ratio indicates that a $1 investment leads to a sizable return of $60 per individual treated . While this analysis does not account for costs following the 5th round of MDA ( e . g . post-MDA surveillance ) , it can be reasonably assumed that the BCR would still remain very significant . Indeed , even if annual economic costs were to persist at an equivalent rate for an additional 10 to 15 years , the economic rate of return per person treated is still approximately $20–$30 for every $1 invested . Comparing the cost-benefit of the GPELF to that of other NTD programs is difficult because there are few directly comparable analyses , particularly at a global level . A review of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control ( APOC ) projected an economic rate of return of 6% to 17% but did not factor in the implied economic cost of the donated drug [74] . This finding is less than the drug-excluded LF cost-benefit estimate presented here , however , several economic benefits apart from onchocercal blindness prevention were not analyzed in the APOC review . Cost-benefit analyses for trachoma have focused almost exclusively on trichiasis surgery in a localized context [75] . A broader array of cost-benefit studies has been carried out for malaria , although with differing scopes and outcome goals , making it challenging to compare results across the same disease , let alone between malaria and LF . In a review of several malaria costing studies , the BCR ranged from 1 . 9 to 17 . 1 using a variety of human capital and burden of disease methodologies [76] . Other approaches assessing a more macroeconomic impact of malaria [77] , [78] have yet to be applied to NTDs but future research into such cost-benefit applications will be critical for validating the investment of the GPELF and stimulating likeminded investigations for related global NTD programs . There has been considerable movement – particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa – toward integrating preventive chemotherapy programs to target multiple NTDs ( e . g . LF , onchocerciasis , schistosomiasis , soil-transmitted helminths [STH] , trachoma ) together . Although there is no clear verdict yet on the benefits of integrated NTD treatments versus standalone vertical programs , early assessments indicate potential savings of 25–47% for the entire group of NTDs can be achieved in Sub-Saharan Africa by packaging MDA interventions together [79] . These findings underlie an important concept of economic analysis , specifically that although an intervention ( e . g . vertically integrated MDA programs for LF ) may have a favorable BCR , there may be more cost-effective alternatives to achieving a similar outcome ( e . g . the number of treatments administered , the total economic benefits of the GPELF ) . In this respect , the GPELF is well positioned to take advantage of synergistic opportunities with other disease program activities including vector control ( malaria and dengue fever ) , surveillance ( guinea worm , onchocerciasis ) , and distribution ( integrated NTDs , Vitamin A ) to maximize cost-effectiveness and economic impact [80] . Joint efforts with the private sector and drug development projects addressing improved sanitation and housing facilities could also contribute to greater cost-effectiveness for the GPELF [81] . While this study is not positioned to analyze cost-effectiveness in details , it is abundantly clear that under any joint or standalone scenario , the GPELF indeed represents an excellent buy in global health . The prevention of LF infection and clinical disease has led to additional benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify in monetary terms . The true economic value of the GPELF is , therefore , arguably much higher based on the numerous quality-of-life benefits achieved through clinical disease aversion , as well as the economic impact that MDA has on other diseases and syndromes related to LF . A narrow range of country-specific primary data somewhat limits the breadth of economic analysis presented in this paper; however , much of the prevailing literature originates from India and Sub-Saharan African countries where over 75% of the benefit cohort population resides . Of significance , there is scarce regional data regarding treatment-seeking behavior for LF patients , but because this is a direct cost input , more exact data would result in only marginal changes to the overall economic impact . Similarly , LF disease-specific parameters ( e . g . ADL frequency and duration , lost workdays ) were attributed a global standardized estimate due to a lack of regional data . Sensitivity analyses conducted earlier in this study presented the resulting economic impact under differing degrees of pathology and indeed , a clearer understanding of regional variability would enrich future economic analyses . Other variables such as wages , health system costs , and direct treatment costs , however , were able to be made region- and country-specific with the aid of international databases from the ILO , WHO , and World Bank . Despite important limitations to our analysis , this study identifies a wide array of economic benefits that have resulted from the first 8 years of the GPELF – approximately US$21 . 8 billion of direct and indirect patient costs will be prevented in the lifetimes of more than 31 million individuals , US$2 . 2 billion of LF-associated patient services saved by national health systems over the lifetimes of the MDA-treated individuals , and additional quality-of-life benefits and treatment of co-morbidities such as STH that make the total economic value of the GPELF unquestionably far greater than the calculable estimate presented here . These achievements notwithstanding , it is clear that the economic impact will be even greater when the GPELF reaches the remaining endemic countries and at-risk populations . Currently , the GPELF has extended to 48 of the 83 endemic countries and treated nearly 570 million individuals – approximately 44% of the ∼1 . 3 billion worldwide at-risk population [8] . Extrapolating this proportion with the US$24 billion lifetime economic benefit already achieved , the full potential economic benefit of the GPELF could be in excess of US$55 billion distributed over each of the endemic WHO regions ( Figure 5 ) . Reaching the remaining at-risk individuals presents notable challenges especially since much of the population not yet reached resides in some of the poorest countries in Africa . Additional resources and economic empowerment will be necessary to assist these countries in implementing programs for LF elimination [91] . The expansion of the GPELF will therefore be a critical building block in this effort and also an important driver for increased attention to NTDs and the continuation of integrated NTD programs . The recognition of the sizable monetary benefit already achieved after 8 years provides new confidence that it is an investment well worth undertaking .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Between 2000–2007 , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1 . 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs ( albendazole , ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine ) to all at-risk for 4–6 years . Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health .</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) was created to prevent and treat a disease called lymphatic filariasis. This disease is caused by a parasite and can lead to disabilities and other serious health problems. Between 2000 and 2007, the GPELF gave more than 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million people, which were given through an annual mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs (albendazole, ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine) to everyone at risk. \\nIt is important to know how much money this program saves by preventing lymphatic filariasis. To do this, researchers looked at how many people got treatments and how many people got better as a result of these treatments. They also looked at the cost of treating lymphatic filariasis, the cost of people not being able to work because of the disease, and the cost of treating people who were sick. They found that over 20 years, the program will save about $21.8 billion by treating about 31.4 million people. About $2.3 billion of this money comes from people who will never get lymphatic filariasis because they were born in areas where the disease is now gone. Another $19.5 billion comes from people who already have the disease, but will not get any worse because of the program. This program will also save health systems about $2.2 billion because people will not need to be treated as much anymore. \\nIn conclusion, treating lymphatic filariasis with the GPELF program saves a lot of money. This is because the cost of the program is low, due in part to the donation of drugs from the pharmaceutical industry. The economic return on this program is very high, which means that it is a great investment in public health.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites . Recent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) , a causative gene of Gaucher disease ( GD ) , are a strong risk for PD . However , its pathological mechanisms leading to PD remain largely unknown . Here , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka which survive long enough for pathological analysis of disease progression . These mutant medaka display not only the phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD but also axonal accumulation of α-syn accompanied by impairment of the autophagy-lysosome pathway . Furthermore , the present study demonstrates this α-syn accumulation has negligible contribution to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka .

       "      <td>Homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) gene result in Gaucher disease ( GD ) , the most common lysosomal storage disease . Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD . \\n Gaucher disease ( GD ) is the most common lysosomal storage disease and is caused by homozygous mutations in glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) . Mutations in GBA lead to decreased enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) and result in the accumulation of its substrates , glucocerebroside and glucosylsphingosine[1 , 2] . GD is classically divided into three subtypes: a non-neuronopathic form ( type 1 ) , an acute neuronopathic form ( type 2 ) , and a subacute neuronopathic form ( type 3 ) . Visceral manifestations of all forms are characterized by hepatosplenomegaly , cytopenia , and skeletal disease . Pathologically , the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages , called Gaucher cells , are observed in the affected organs . Neurological manifestations of neuronopathic forms include brainstem dysfunction , intellectual disability , seizures , and myoclonic movement . Pathological features of neuronopathic forms are neuronal loss , astrogliosis , microgliosis , and perivascular accumulation of Gaucher cells[3] . The most severe neuronopathic form , called the perinatal lethal type , has also been reported[4] . Common presentations of patients with the perinatal lethal type are hydrops fetalis and congenital ichthyosis . Almost no residual GCase enzymatic activity is found in these cases . Because currently available therapies are ineffective for neurological manifestations , a strong demand exists for elucidation of the pathological mechanisms and the development of novel therapies . Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder . GBA has recently drawn considerable attention because heterozygous mutations in this gene confer a high risk for sporadic PD[5 , 6] . In addition , patients with type 1 GD also have an increased life-time risk of developing PD[7] . PD patients carrying GBA mutations show intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites , which are the pathological hallmarks of sporadic PD[3] . Several cellular , animal , and postmortem studies have indicated an association between GBA mutations and α-syn accumulation . For example , deficiency in GCase enzymatic activity causes lysosomal dysfunction and α-syn accumulation[8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12] . Increased α-syn in turn creates a vicious cycle by inhibiting the trafficking of GCase to lysosomes , thus leading to decreased GCase activity in lysosomes[9] . Consistent with this notion , mouse models overexpressing α-syn and postmortem tissue from patients with PD show reduced GCase activity in the brains[13 , 14 , 15] . Although several hypotheses have been proposed , further mechanisms of how GBA mutations contribute to the development of PD remain elusive . Medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) are a versatile vertebrate animal model for disease research . These fish are easy to handle , have a relatively short generation time ( 2–3 months ) , produce a large number of progeny per generation , and have several inbred strains[16] . Importantly , medaka have an advantage as an animal model of PD due to endogenous α-syn in contrast to invertebrate models that lack α-syn . Moreover , several genetic manipulations can be performed in medaka in addition to established transgenic techniques[17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21] . So far , we have reported genetic PD models of medaka that develop locomotor dysfunction accompanied by the selective loss of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons[22 , 23] . Considering these lines of evidence , medaka have the potential to be a new animal model of PD . Here , we generated GBA nonsense mutant medaka and found that homozygous GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka are a viable neuronopathic GD model . GBA-/- medaka developed remarkable α-syn accumulation in the brains and thus provide novel insights into the association of GBA mutations with α-syn accumulation . Furthermore , we revealed minimal contribution of endogenous α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . \\n We generated GBA nonsense mutant medaka to investigate the mechanisms by which GBA mutation leads to PD . To identify medaka GBA orthologs , we searched the medaka genome database ( http://www . ensembl . org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index ) with the basic local alignment search tool and found only one ortholog of human GBA . We cloned the medaka GBA with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends and found that this gene has 11 exons encoding a protein of 522 amino acids . The amino acid sequence of medaka GBA showed 53% homology to that of human GBA ( S1 Fig ) . Next , we screened a targeting-induced local lesions in genome ( TILLING ) library for medaka GBA using a high-resolution melting assay[17 , 24] . We identified a nonsense mutant ( W337X ) and generated the nonsense mutant medaka by in vitro fertilization ( Fig . 1A ) . We examined GCase activity in the brains of GBA mutants after crossing with heterozygous mutants . GBAW337X/W337X ( GBA-/- ) medaka showed complete deficiency in GCase activity , and GBAWT/W337X ( GBA+/- ) medaka showed a decrease in GCase activity of about 50% compared to wild-type ( GBA+/+ ) medaka ( Fig . 1B ) . Although humans and mice lacking GCase activity die soon after birth[4 , 25 , 26] , GBA-/- medaka survived for more than 3 months , enabling us to analyze the pathological progression ( Fig . 1D ) . GBA-/- medaka showed abnormal rotating swimming movement at 2 months ( S1 , S2 Movie ) and the abnormal appearance of a bent spine at 3 months ( Fig . 1C ) . High levels of glucocerebroside accumulated in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 1E ) , whereas the amount of galactocerebroside , an isomer of glucocerebroside , was not changed . Glucocerebroside with C18 fatty acids was the most dominant type in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( S2 Fig ) , an observation that is consistent with the neuronopathic GD mouse model[27] . We performed pathological analyses of GBA-/- medaka . Patients with GD show Periodic acid-Schiff-positive Gaucher cells in affected visceral organs such as the liver , spleen , and bone marrow , whereas GBA-/- medaka showed abnormal Periodic acid-Schiff-positive cells in the spleen and kidney , but not in the liver , at 3 months ( S3 Fig ) . Next , we examined the brains of GBA-/- medaka and found abnormal cells with large vacuoles mainly in the periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum ( Fig . 2A , B ) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed that these cells were macrophage-like and had large vacuoles containing filamentous structures ( Fig . 2C ) . Similar filamentous structures are observed in Gaucher cells of patients with GD and mouse models of GD[26 , 28 , 29] . The staining intensity with Luxol fast blue was decreased , and single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) -positive cells were observed in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D ) , indicating myelin loss and cell death , respectively . In situ hybridization for apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) , a microglial marker in teleost fish[30] , revealed proliferating activated microglia in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D ) . Teleost fish have glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) -expressing radial glial cells ( or ependymoglial cells ) instead of astrocytes as in mammals[31] . Humans and mice with neuronopathic GD show astrogliosis in their brains[3 , 32] , whereas neither proliferation of GFAP-positive radial glial cells nor elevated levels of GFAP were observed in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D , E ) . To investigate the type of neuronal cells that die in GBA-/- medaka , we counted the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) -positive dopaminergic neurons in the middle diencephalon , which corresponds to the human substantia nigra[33] , TH-positive noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus , and tryptophan hydroxylase ( TPH ) -positive serotonergic neurons in the superior raphe at 2 and 3 months . GBA-/- medaka showed progressive cell loss of all these neurons ( Fig . 2F ) . Consistent with these findings , the amount of TH was decreased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2G ) . Collectively , GBA-/- medaka exhibited neuronopathic GD-like pathology including progressive and non-selective neuronal loss . Medaka express α-syn , which is a protein consisting of 127 amino acids . To investigate α-syn pathology in GBA-/- medaka , we created a medaka α-syn antibody against the epitope of amino acids 90 to 104 ( S4A Fig ) . Medaka also express β-synuclein , γ-synuclein-a , and γ-synuclein-b in addition to α-syn , but these other synucleins do not have amino acid sequences homologous to the epitope of the medaka α-syn antibody ( S4B Fig ) . Next , we generated α-syn deletion mutant medaka using TALENs . Deletion of 11 bases near the start codon in α-syn resulted in a frame shift mutation ( S4C Fig ) . Wild-type , heterozygous , and homozygous α-syn deletion mutant ( α-syn+/+ , α-syn+/- , and α-syn-/- , respectively ) medaka could be distinguished with PCR analysis of α-syn ( S4D Fig ) . RT-PCR analysis of α-syn mRNA revealed that α-syn-/- medaka did not express intact α-syn mRNA ( S4E Fig ) . Western blot analysis with the medaka α-syn antibody revealed a 14-kDa band , which was specifically found in α-syn+/+ medaka ( S4F Fig ) . The authenticity of the antibody was confirmed by the lack of immunostaining with the medaka α-syn antibody in the brains of α-syn-/- medaka ( S4G Fig ) . Consistent with the findings in mammals , medaka α-syn was mainly found presynaptically with immunoelectron microscopy ( S4H Fig ) . Then , we performed immunohistochemical analysis and found abundant α-syn accumulation in the brains of GBA-/- medaka at 3 months ( Fig . 3A ) . α-syn accumulation was also observed at 2 months , but not at 1 month ( S5 Fig ) . Abnormal structures observed with toluidine blue staining were similar to α-syn accumulations in size and distribution ( Fig . 3A ) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed numerous axonal swellings containing vacuoles and other various materials in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Figs . 3B , S6A ) . A considerable number of these vacuoles had double membranes and sometimes contained mitochondria , suggesting that these vacuoles were autophagosomes . Consistent with this , LC3 , an autophagosomal marker , accumulated in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3A ) . Moreover , immunogold-labeled α-syn was detected in axonal swellings with immunoelectron microscopy ( Fig . 3C ) . Conventional and confocal double immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that accumulated α-syn colocalized with LC3 accumulations ( Fig . 3D ) , and a considerable portion of the α-syn signals in axonal swellings colocalized with LC3 signals ( Figs . 3E , S6B ) . In addition to these findings , ubiquitin also accumulated in α-syn-positive axonal swellings ( Figs . 3E , S6B ) . To examine the α-syn expression level and solubility , we performed sequential biochemical fractionation assays . The total amount of α-syn in the Triton-soluble fraction was not increased in GBA-/- medaka . However , when adjusted for the amount of neuron-specific enolase ( NSE ) and considering the robust neuronal loss in GBA-/- medaka , α-syn was significantly increased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . The decreased amount of neurofilament also reflected the neuronal loss in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . No apparent α-syn band was detected in the Triton-insoluble , SDS-soluble fraction in all genotypes . In agreement with the accumulation of autophagosomes in axonal swellings , the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was increased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . Meanwhile , we also investigated the phenotypes of GBA+/- medaka because heterozygous mutations in GBA are a strong risk for PD[5 , 6] . However , GBA+/- medaka even at 12 months did not show any apparent abnormal phenotypes including α-syn pathology , the numbers of TH-positive neurons , swimming movement , or the amounts of several neurotransmitters ( S7A–S7E Fig ) . Previous studies of GD mouse models reported that p62/SQSTM1 ( an autophagic substrate ) accumulates in neurons and astrocytes[34] , and the number of Cathepsin D-positive puncta is decreased in neurons[35] . These observations prompted us to examine the autophagy-lysosome pathway in GBA-/- medaka . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ubiquitin- and p62-positive aggregates were observed mainly in the perikarya of neurons ( Figs . 4A , D , S8B ) . These aggregates were observed only in neurons and not in GFAP-positive radial glial cells or Lycopersicon Esculentum ( Tomato ) Lectin ( LEL ) -positive microglia ( S8A Fig ) . LEL is an excellent teleost microglial marker[36] . Western blot analysis showed that the amounts of ubiquitin and p62 were increased in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 4C ) . In contrast , these aggregates did not colocalize with LC3 accumulations or Cathepsin D-positive organelles ( Figs . 4D , S8B ) . These organelles , which are putative lysosomes , showed decreased Cathepsin D staining intensity and abnormal morphology ( Fig . 4A ) . Consistent with this , neurons that contained lysosome-like organelles filled with filamentous structures were observed with transmission electron microscopy ( Fig . 4B ) . GBA nonsense mutant medaka have random point mutations in the genome at loci other than GBA . Therefore , we performed a rescue experiment to determine whether the abnormal phenotypes observed in GBA-/- medaka were really caused by GBA mutation . We created medaka GBA-expressing vectors driven by a medaka growth-associated protein 43 ( GAP-43 ) promoter ( S9A Fig ) [37] . GAP-43 mRNA is expressed mainly in nervous system in medaka[37] . We established six medaka GBA transgenic lines ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ) using these vectors and crossed them with GBA nonsense mutant medaka . Each line of GBA-/- medaka with GBA transgene ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ;GBA-/- ) showed GCase activity of various levels in the brains at 3 months ( S9B Fig ) . All lines of Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ;GBA-/- medaka showed normal swimming movement at 2 months ( S3 Movie ) . Also , the swimming distance was increased in Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) line3;GBA-/- medaka ( S9C Fig ) . Pathological analysis of the brains of Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) line3;GBA-/- medaka including hematoxylin and eosin staining , in situ hybridization for APOE , and immunohistochemistry for p62 and α-syn revealed no apparent abnormality ( S9D Fig ) . We concluded that the abnormal phenotypes observed in the brains of GBA-/- medaka were caused by the GBA mutation . Many studies have reported that accumulated α-syn caused by α-syn overexpression results in neurotoxicity[38] . Neuroinflammation is observed in the brains of patients with PD , and much evidence shows that neuroinflammation promotes disease progression[39] . Moreover , a recent study reported that oligomeric α-syn released from neurons activates inflammatory responses in microglia[40] . We examined the toxicity of α-syn in GBA-/- medaka by crossing GBA nonsense mutant medaka with α-syn deletion mutant medaka . α-syn-/- medaka showed no apparent abnormal phenotypes in their outer appearance , swimming movement , or life span like α-syn-disrupted mice[41] . The life spans of GBA-/-α-syn+/- and GBA-/-α-syn-/- medaka were not prolonged compared to that of GBA-/-α-syn+/+ medaka ( Fig . 5A ) . Moreover , the number of LC3-positive puncta was not changed in GBA-/-α-syn-/- medaka , indicating that α-syn was not primarily involved in formation of axonal swellings ( Fig . 5B ) . The numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the middle diencephalon and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus were not changed in either GBA-/- α-syn+/- or GBA-/- α-syn-/- medaka ( Fig . 5C ) . We also examined the extent of neuroinflammation with in situ hybridization for APOE and quantitative RT-PCR for tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) α mRNA . The number of APOE-positive cells and the expression level of TNFα were not changed ( Fig . 5D , E ) . Collectively , we found no evidence for α-syn involvement in the short life span , formation of axonal swellings , dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss , and neuroinflammation that are observed in GBA -/- medaka . \\n To date , several genetic animal models of neuronopathic GD including mouse , dog , and sheep have been reported[42] . Gba null mice die within 24 hours of birth due to permeability barrier defects in the skin[26 , 43] . Thus , conditional knockout K14-lnl/lnl mice with normal GCase activity in their skin were generated[27] . However , use of these mice is limited because they survive only 2 weeks after birth . Mice harboring a Gba missense mutation combined with prosaposin- or saposin C-deficient mice , another neuronopathic GD model , also show neuronopathic abnormalities[29 , 34] and have the advantage of longer survival than K14-lnl/lnl mice . However , the relevance of these mice to neuronopathic GD is controversial . The present study revealed that GBA-/- medaka survive long enough for pathological analysis of disease progression . As an example , GBA-/- medaka showed α-syn accumulation at 2 months , not at 1 month after fertilization . Considering these observations , GBA-/- medaka are useful as a viable neuronopathic GD model with endogenous α-syn accumulation . GBA-/- medaka showed several phenotypes different from those of mammalian neuronopathic GD model . Firstly , the skin of GBA-/- medaka looks intact whereas severe skin lesion is observed in patients with perinatal lethal type GD and Gba null mice[4 , 43] . Secondly , GBA-/- medaka exhibited PAS-positive abnormal cells in spleen and kidney which presumably correspond to human Gaucher cells . In patients with GD , Gaucher cells are not found in kidney , but in liver , spleen and bone marrow . These differences could be explained by the fact that in adult teleost fish kidney has hematopoietic function instead of mammalian bone marrow[44] . Lastly , the proliferation of GFAP-positive radial glial cells was not observed in GBA-/- medaka whereas astrogliosis is observed in humans and mice with neuronopathic GD . It was reported that the reaction of GFAP-positive radial glial cells to inflammation is different from that of mammalian astrocytes[31] . Lysosomes play a fundamental role in the autophagic pathway by fusing with autophagosomes and digesting their contents[45] . In general , lysosomal dysfunction results in defective digestion and accumulation of autophagic substrates such as polyubiquitinated proteins , p62 , and dysfunctional mitochondria , accompanied by accumulation of autophagosomes . Axonal swellings containing autophagosome-like structures are observed in mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases such as neuronopathic GD mice , Niemann-pick type C1 mice , Cathepsin D-deficient mice , and Cathepsin B/L double-deficient mice[34 , 46 , 47] . A previous study reported that autophagosomes are formed in the distal part of the axon and undergo retrograde transport toward the cell body[48] . Another previous study demonstrated that inhibition of lysosomal function in primary neurons from mouse embryos disrupts the axonal transport of autophagosomes and causes their accumulation in axons[49] . Considering these lines of evidence , we propose that GCase deficiency primarily causes lysosomal dysfunction , leading to disrupted retrograde transport of autophagosomes in axons and formation of axonal swellings with α-syn accumulation ( Fig . 6 ) . Contrary to our expectations , p62-positive aggregates did not colocalize with LC3- and α-syn-positive axonal swellings , but were mainly located in the perikarya of neurons . These results suggest the possibility that presynaptic α-syn is transported proximally and degraded in a p62-independent autophagy-lysosome pathway . A previous study supports this hypothesis . Conditional knockout mice lacking ATG7 in TH-positive neurons show α-syn aggregates in swollen axons in the striatum , but not in cell bodies in the midbrain , indicating that autophagic dysfunction initially causes α-syn aggregates in the distal part of axons[50] . In addition , another previous study demonstrated that α-syn aggregation occurs earlier in axons than in neuronal cell bodies in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in PD patients[51] . Because axonal retrograde transport may be involved in the degradative pathway of α-syn and may be a therapeutic target in PD , further studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms . Because GBA+/- medaka as old as 12 months did not show any apparent abnormal phenotypes , we could not directly investigate how heterozygous GBA mutations cause PD . Meanwhile , according to a recent report , induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from PD patients carrying heterozygous GBA mutations show α-syn accumulation , an impaired autophagy-lysosome pathway , and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis[12] . The reason for differences in phenotypes between in vivo and in vitro models is unclear . However , our findings from GBA+/- medaka seem to be reasonable because the penetrance of PD in GBA mutation carriers is estimated to be at most 30% by the age of 80 years[52] . Thus , second hits such as environmental factors and other genetic factors are probably required for the development of PD pathology in vivo . Cellular and animal PD models overexpressing α-syn have provided evidence for the various potential toxic mechanisms of α-syn . However , few studies have demonstrated the pathological role of endogenous α-syn in vivo , which may reflect the authentic role for α-syn in PD . A previous study showed that α-syn null mice are resistant to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 , 2 , 3 , 6-tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) toxicity compared with wild-type mice[53] . However , it is unclear whether this improvement is due to attenuation of α-syn toxicity or α-syn-mediated changes in the presynaptic machinery . Another previous study showed that the formation of intraneuronal inclusions and neurodegeneration in 26S proteasome-depleted mice is independent of α-syn[54] . In the present study , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Moreover , α-syn was not involved in the accumulation of autophagosomes in axons . Our data indicate that α-syn accumulation is a downstream event , and other severe pathological factors may obscure the involvement of α-syn in the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . In summary , the present study showed that GBA-/- medaka are useful as a viable neuronopathic GD model with endogenous α-syn accumulation . Long-term survival of these fish allows us to observe the pathological progression . Our data revealed that GCase deficiency causes lysosomal dysfunction in neurons and α-syn accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Axonal transport of α-syn may play an important role in the mechanisms of GBA mutations leading to PD and may also be a therapeutic target in PD . Furthermore , we demonstrate the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . GBA-/- medaka represent a valuable model for exploring the pathological mechanisms and also provide a new platform for developing treatments in PD with GBA mutations as well as neuronopathic GD . \\n Medaka were anesthetized in 0 . 02% tricaine in fish water and then sacrificed . All experimental procedures used in this study followed national guidelines . The Animal Research Committee of Kyoto University granted a formal waiver of ethical approval and also granted permission . Medaka of the Kyoto-cab strain , a substrain of Cab , were maintained at 27°C in a recirculating aquaculture system . Adult fish were kept in a reproduction regimen ( 14 hr light/10 hr dark ) . Eggs were kept in a dark box at 28°C . RNA was extracted from wild-type medaka brains with Qiazol ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit ( Perfect Real Time ) ( TaKaRa , #RR037A ) . To identify medaka GBA , SNCA , SNCGb , p62/SQSTM1 , and MAP1LC3B orthologs , we referred to the medaka genome database ( http://www . ensembl . org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index ) . Because their cDNA sequences and amino acid sequences were not completely known , we determined their cDNA sequences using a combination of RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends , the products of which were generated using Seegene’s Capfishing kit ( Seegene ) . The cDNA sequences can be found in the European Nucleotide Archive ( ENA , accession numbers LM644999–645003 ) . GBA mutant medaka were generated as described[17] . To find GBA mutations in the TILLING library , we narrowed down mutated candidates from 5 , 771 samples using a high-resolution melting assay , followed by determination of the DNA sequences[24] . We screened the TILLING library for exons 1–2 , exons 5–7 , exon 8 , and exons 9–11 of GBA . In vitro fertilization was carried out using sperm from a sample with the favorable mutation . To genotype the progeny of GBAWT/W337X mutants , PCR was performed with the following primer set ( 5′-AGGGTTGAAGGGGTTAAGCA-3′ , 5′-TTGTAACCAGTACCGCAGCA-3′ ) , designed HybProbes ( 5′-LC Red 640-CATGTACCAGTGGACG-Phosphate-3′ , 5′-CCTAAGCTTATATCTGCAGGGACTAAACTGT-Fluorescein-3′ ) , and LightCycler 480 Probes Master in LightCycler 480 ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . The genotypes can be distinguished with high-resolution melting curve analysis . GBAWT/W337X mutants were back-crossed to Kyoto-Cab medaka at least seven times and then crossed to obtain GBAW337X/W337X mutants . For the rescue experiment , we established GBA transgenic medaka in which medaka GBA expression was driven by the medaka GAP-43 promoter ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ) . We used an insulator located in the upstream region of sea urchin ( Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus ) arylsulfatase[55 , 56] . The transgenic construct was flanked by two insulators and included the medaka GAP-43 promoter followed by an internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) , enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) , and the Simian virus 40 polyadenylation site or the medaka β-actin 3′-untranslated region ( 3′UTR ) ( S8A Fig ) . The medaka GAP-43 promoter contained a 1 . 0-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the gene . A DNA fragment of the transgene was inserted into EcoR I/Sal I restriction enzyme sites of the pDs-actb2k-EGFP plasmid . pDs-actb2k-EGFP was constructed by inserting an Xho I/Spe I fragment from pactb2k-EGFP into the Xho I/Spe I site of the pDs-GTDEL4 plasmid , which contains 5′- and 3′-Ds sequences[21 , 57] . The resultant vector was injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized Kyoto-Cab eggs before the first cleavage as described[20] . α-syn deletion mutant medaka were generated with TALENs as described[58] . To genotype the progeny of α-syn deletion mutants , PCR was performed with the following primer set ( 5′-GATCCCGAGCCATCCAC-3′ , 5′-TGCAACTGTGGAAACACCAT-3′ ) , followed by electrophoresis in a 10% ( w/v ) polyacrylamide gel ( S4D Fig ) .

For SDS-soluble fractions , the pellet was subsequently sonicated in SDS buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , 2% SDS , pH 7 . 4 ) followed by centrifugation at 20 , 400 ×g at 4°C for 5 min . The supernatant was boiled in sample buffer ( 1% ( w/v ) SDS , 12 . 5% ( w/v ) glycerol , 0 . 005% ( w/v ) bromophenol blue , 2 . 5% ( v/v ) 2-mercaptoethanol , 25 mM Tris-HCl , pH 6 . 8 ) .

       "      <td>Homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) gene result in Gaucher disease ( GD ) , the most common lysosomal storage disease . Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Gaucher disease (GD) is a rare genetic condition that causes the body to accumulate a substance called glucocerebroside (GC) in certain organs. Research has shown that certain genetic mutations that cause GD can also increase the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, researchers created a type of fish called medaka that lacked a protein called Gaucher disease-related protein (GCase), which is usually responsible for breaking down GC. Surprisingly, these GCase-deficient fish lived for several months, allowing researchers to study the development of GD-like symptoms in more detail. The fish showed many of the same symptoms as people with neuronopathic GD, including the buildup of Gaucher-like cells in the brain, progressive nerve cell loss, and microglia (a type of brain cell). These symptoms were caused by lysosomal problems in nerve cells and the accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein in swollen nerve cells. However, when researchers tried to remove alpha-synuclein from the fish, this did not improve their symptoms or extend their lifespan. This study provides new insights into the development of GD-like symptoms and the role of alpha-synuclein in GD.</td>\n",

       "      <td>With a comprehensive understanding of the underlying energetics for a biomolecular machine , such as the ribosome , we may quantitatively identify the essential factors that determine function . In molecular-level machines , the energetic fluctuations arising from the surrounding solvent become comparable to the energetics that direct each process . In this regime , structural rearrangements may be described as diffusive movements across a free-energy landscape . By adopting this framework , it is possible to quantitatively relate theoretical predictions , computational results , experimental rates and biochemical data , which will allow for a self-consistent description to be obtained . To this end , we have used an explicit-solvent simulation ( 2 . 1 million atoms , 1 . 3 microseconds ) to measure the diffusion along multiple structural coordinates that have been implicated in tRNA translocation in the ribosome . With the diffusion coefficients in hand , we demonstrate how they may be used to bridge theoretical and experimental descriptions of complex collective dynamics in a molecular machine .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Functional rearrangements in biomolecular assemblies result from diffusion across an underlying energy landscape . While bulk kinetic measurements rely on discrete state-like approximations to the energy landscape , single-molecule methods can project the free energy onto specific coordinates . With measures of the diffusion , one may establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape . We used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome ( 2 . 1 million atoms; 1 . 3 microseconds ) to provide this bridge for specific conformational events associated with the process of tRNA translocation . Starting from a pre-translocation configuration , we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function . Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation were then used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape . This analysis , in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation , provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation . While this analysis was performed for a particular kinetic scheme of translocation , the quantitative framework is general and may be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states . \\n Biological machines are ubiquitous in the cell and typically contain many molecules that include protein , RNA , and other cofactors . Each molecule provides a unique contribution to an assembly's energy landscape , which then governs the machine's function . Accordingly , quantifying the landscape's features and molecular origins may allow one to precisely manipulate the physical-chemical properties that dictate the biological dynamics . Despite the pressing need for a quantitative description of the energy landscapes that underpin function , most experimental techniques report on the rates of interconversion between states , where each state is a discretized approximation to an energetic basin . To bridge discrete and continuous descriptions for a molecular machine , such as the ribosome , it is necessary to quantify the diffusive properties of functionally-relevant collective rearrangements . The observed , or effective , diffusion of each component of a biomolecular complex is determined by the intrinsic diffusion of that component ( free in solution ) as well as the short-scale energetic roughness that is introduced by molecular interfaces [1]–[5] . In other words , the landscape is characterized by energetic barriers that are associated with a hierarchy of length scales ( Fig . 1 ) [6] , [7] , where the effective diffusion is dictated by the magnitude of the short length-scale roughness . Structural rearrangements may then be described by effective ( short length-scale averaged ) diffusion on a smooth , large-scale , energy landscape . By measuring the effective diffusion , one may determine the relationship between the long length-scale free-energy barriers and the kinetics associated with interconversion between well-defined states . The ribosome has long been considered to function as a “thermal ratchet machine” [8] , in that random energetic fluctuations that result from finite temperatures lead to large-scale diffusive ( i . e . Brownian ) configurational rearrangements . While smFRET and simulations directly monitor diffusive movement across the landscape , kinetic and structural measures utilize discrete state-like approximations to describe a molecule's dynamics . These seemingly disparate perspectives can be rationalized by adopting energy landscape theory [9] , [10] , which was developed in the context of protein folding and then extended to describe functional dynamics [11]–[15] . To this end , we have combined all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and principles from energy landscape theory to provide the quantities necessary to describe large-scale collective dynamics in the ribosome . To achieve this , we analyzed the dynamics of an explicit-solvent simulation of an intact ribosome to identify groups of residues that undergo collective rotations/displacements . From this , we identified collective reaction coordinates that capture 30S-body rotation ( i . e . “ratchet-like” motion ) , 30S-head swivel and tRNA displacements ( Fig . 2 and 3 ) , which are essential motions during substrate translocation ( i . e . the directional movement of tRNA and mRNA molecules , with respect to the ribosomal subunits; described in detail in Text S1 ) [16] , [17] . In a continuous 1 . 3 microsecond explicit-solvent simulation of the pre-translocation complex , frequent small-scale body-rotation , head-swiveling and tRNA fluctuations were observed , from which effective diffusion coefficients were calculated in each coordinate space ( Fig . 4 ) . Full body and head rotation during translocation encompass angular displacements of and [18]–[23] . Smaller net rotations ( and ) were observed in the simulation . Dynamics of the pre-translocation complex provided quantitative measures of the short time-scale ( 10–100 ns ) fluctuations and effective diffusion in each space , which were used to relate the kinetics and free-energy barriers of translocation . From this analysis , we provide experimentally-grounded upper bounds for the long length-scale barriers associated with translocation , as well as estimates for the magnitude of the short-scale energetic roughness . \\n To quantify the energy landscape of translocation , it is necessary to identify coordinates that are able to accurately capture these motions ( which encompass large-scale rotary movement of the subunits ) . Structural approaches , such as x-ray spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) , provide snapshots of the ribosome that describe the average configurations of energetic minima . These structural models provide tremendous insights into the global architecture of biomolecular assemblies , though the models can not separate fluctuations that are due to movement of individual residues from many-residue collective rearrangements . For example , x-ray and cryo-EM models have shown that the 30S subunit rotates relative to the 50S subunit [18]–[23] . From structural models of the endpoints , one may be inclined to think that movement is rigid-body like , since rigid atomic models may fit well to the endpoint configurations . However , biomolecular systems are constantly subject to energetic fluctuations that arise from the surrounding solvent [24] , [25] , leading to heterogeneous distributions of atomic fluctuations . Accordingly , some regions exhibit fluctuations in the coordinates that are faster than ( and not coupled to ) the global rearrangements [26] . Here , we use all-atom explicit-solvent simulations to ask: For tRNA translocation in the ribosome , can we decompose the process into a superposition of slow , large-scale collective movements and rapid local fluctuations ? If so , what regions of the ribosome undergo each class of motions ? As described below , we find that many residues undergo coordinated displacements , which are reminiscent of rigid body movement . In addition to the coordinated movement of these “rigid” groups , roughly half of the rRNA residues undergo independent fluctuations . These peripheral fluctuations are likely linked to functional capabilities and control of the ribosome , which may include the movement of ribosomal “stalks” during elongation [27]–[33] , regulation of tRNA association and movement [34]–[38] , antibiotic function [39] and ribosomal stalling [40] . To probe the energy landscape of 30S body and head rotation and tRNA displacements , we first identified reaction coordinates upon which to project the free energy . For an appropriate coordinate ( here , , , and ) , the potential of mean force ( pmf ) captures the scale and position of the multidimensional free-energy barrier . Then , , where and are the probability distribution and free energy , as functions of . In order to describe body and head rotation as effective diffusion along an energy surface , each reaction coordinate was required to satisfy the following minimal set of conditions: 1 ) for each biomolecular configuration , is uniquely defined; 2 ) is a continuous function of the molecular coordinates; 3 ) collective rearrangements are measured by and independent fluctuations of individual atoms are not; 4 ) movement between the endpoints of translocation leads to changes in , while orthogonal displacements do not; 5 ) the endpoints and the transition state ensembles ( TSEs ) correspond to distinguishable values of ; and 6 ) the dynamics in -space is diffusive . In addition to these conditions , it would be desirable to also demonstrate that the dynamics along each coordinate is Markovian , and that the theoretical free-energy profile and diffusion coefficient ( possibly coordinate-dependent ) yield a rate that is consistent with the same simulated trajectory . While that form of analysis is computationally tractable for the folding of small proteins [41]–[46] , it is not yet feasible for systems as large as the ribosome . However , as computational capacity [47] and methods [48] continue to develop , it may soon be possible to perform comparable analysis for large system . Nonetheless , at this point , we use the remaining conditions to provide evidence of the suitability for a specific set of coordinates for translocation , with which the relationship between barriers and kinetics are calculated . Since and are continuous functions of the atomic coordinates , conditions 1 and 2 are met . Conditions 3–5 were ensured through analysis of an explicit-solvent simulation , crystallographic models and atomic models of cryo-EM reconstructions ( Fig . 3; see Methods and Text S1 ) . As discussed below , in the simulation , movement along and is diffusive in character , indicating that point 6 is also satisfied . ( called elsewhere ) was previously shown to satisfy these considerations [49] . Together , these calculations provide systematically-identified coordinates for describing the diffusive body-rotation , head-swivel and tRNA displacements that occur during translocation . To construct coordinates for 30S body and head rotation ( and ) that measure collective rotations and not the fluctuations of individual atoms , we first identified groups of residues within each subunit that undergo minimal ( 1 Å ) internal structural fluctuations . This was accomplished through an iterative-exclusion strategy ( See Methods ) that is based on the spatial root-mean-squared fluctuations ( rmsf ) of each residue ( Fig . 3A ) . Consistent with previous calculations [27]–[31] , [50] and experimental measurements [51] , large portions of the ribosome were relatively immobile in the simulation ( i . e . small internal rearrangements ) , whereas peripheral regions underwent rapid , larger-scale structural fluctuations . Of the 2903 residues in the 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit , we identified 1353 residues as scaffolding , or “core , ” residues . Similarly , in the 16S rRNA of the 30S subunit , of the 1060 30S-body residues considered , 443 were identified as being part of the core . Of the 284 30S-head residues considered , 178 were identified as core residues ( Figs . 3 and S1; see Text S1 for list of residues ) . Consistent with our identification of the core residues , many have small anisotropic crystallographic B-factors [52] , which measure the mobility of each atom [53] . A noticeable exception is the elevated B-factors of the 30S-head residues ( Fig . S2 ) . This may be attributed to the fact that the B-factors measure the total dispersion in the coordinates , where relative displacements of domains can elevate the B-factors , even if each domain is internally rigid . In the case of the 30S-head region , uncertainties in the relative orientation of the head , relative to the 30S body and the 50S are likely to elevate the B-factors . Through simulation , we avoid this effect by calculating the relative mobility of subsets of residues , which specifically isolates the internal fluctuations of each region . Analysis of the fluctuations of each subregion ( 50S , 30S-body and 30S-head ) indicates that large sets of atoms within each subunit maintain their structural integrity while the core group undergoes displacements relative to other subunits . Accordingly , the configurations of the cores residues were analyzed for a variety of experimental structural models , in order to identify the vectors of rotation that define and ( Fig . 3; See Methods ) . Rather than measure the relative orientation of a single pairs of atoms in each model , which would be susceptible to the local fluctuations of each atom , collective rearrangement of each subunit was measured by first finding the average orientation of the core residues in each model . That is , even if every atom fluctuates in Cartesian space with the same length scale , the projection onto the coordinates would depend on the distance between the atom pair used . Individual atomic fluctuations would then have differential effects on the rotation fluctuations , if the averaging step were not employed . To obtain the average , a reference model was fit to the core residues of each structural model . The rotation vector was then defined by finding the atom pair ( within the rigid , fitted models ) that has a maximal difference in angle between functional configurations ( See Methods and Text S1 for details ) . With the rotation vectors identified , the rotation angles may be calculated for any experimental or computationally-generated configuration of the ribosome . Here , we provide the values of and for a variety of available x-ray and cryo-EM models ( Table S1 ) , as well as for each frame of our simulated trajectory ( 10 ps intervals ) . With the rotation angles calculated for each simulated frame , we next asked if the dynamics in these coordinate spaces is diffusive , or not . We found that the rotation coordinates and tRNA coordinate exhibit diffusive behavior ( Fig . 4B/D ) , supporting their use as reaction coordinates for translocation . The displacement-squared along each coordinate scales linearly with time , at long time , such that effective diffusion coefficients along each can be obtained from the relation: ( 1 ) where indicates an average over all simulated frames that are separated by a given value of , and is the timescale associated with diffusive movement ( i . e . where becomes linear ) . After an initial burst phase ( 30 ns , Fig . S3 ) , and exhibit linear behavior , with linear correlation coefficients ( c . c . ) of 0 . 97 and 0 . 98 . Similarly , after an initial burst phase of 10 ns , follows a linear trend ( Fig . 4D ) , where c . c . = 0 . 99 . This linear behavior is characteristic of diffusive dynamics , where the slopes of each fit indicate = 1 . 39 degrees , = 2 . 95 degrees and . For discussion on uncertainties in , see Text S1 . In our previous analysis of tRNA diffusion during accommodation [49] , we used Eq . 1 to calculate , and compared it to the values obtained using a quasi-harmonic approximation , which accounts for the local curvature of each free-energy basin [54] . When using Eq . 1 , the obtained diffusion coefficients were smaller ( 1/2 ) than those using the quasi-harmonic approximation [49] . One explanation for the attenuated values when using Eq . 1 is that the local curvature of the basin can reduce growth of at long time . That is , as the system samples higher free-energy configurations , it eventually is thermodynamically favorable to return to the minimum . This can lead to decreased values of at large , which would be associated with smaller values of . While it would be beneficial to directly compare the two approaches , in addition to other proposed methods [41]–[46] , the current data set is not sufficient for such comparisons . Additionally , and do not appear to fluctuate about a single well-defined energetic minimum ( Fig . 4 ) during the course of the simulation , thus the quasi-harmonic approximation is not expected to provide reliable estimates for the present data set . Taken together , these considerations suggest that the diffusion coefficients reported here may be lower-bound estimates for the effective diffusion coefficients for 30S-body and 30S-head rotation . Effective diffusion coefficients describe the short length-scale energetic roughness [1]–[3] , allowing us to infer the energetic character of the landscape at different functional stages . The scale of the local energetic roughness relates the effective diffusion and the diffusion of a free molecule , according to the relation: ( 2 ) We find that for the classical A/A-P/P-configured tRNAs , which is consistent with previously reported values [49] . However , it is significantly lower than for the A/T-configured tRNA molecule ( i . e . the configuration in which aminoacyl-tRNA is delivered to the ribosome ) , where ( nearly identical to the free diffusion in solution ) . This suggests that the energetic roughness increases as a tRNA molecule enters the ribosome and reaches a value of ( kcal/mol ) as it maneuvers through the interior of the particle . While we consider these values of the diffusion to be initial estimates , additional considerations suggest the presented values are reliable measures . First , the diffusive regime for each coordinate is reached at lag times ( ) of ns . Since this is far faster than the full-scale rotations implicated during translocation ( milliseconds ) , these measures of describe shorter-scale processes and should not be heavily influenced by large-scale barrier crossing processes . Second , in the course of the simulation , there does not appear to be a strongly-preferred orientation of the domains . This suggests that the energetic basin of attraction associated with the classical configuration is not sharply defined . As discussed above , the local curvature may have an impact on . However , the absence of a well-defined minimum would suggest that this effect will be small . In other words , the diffusive time-regime is far shorter than the timescale associated with barrier-crossing attempts ( see next section ) . Finally , the obtained diffusion coefficients do not differ significantly when only the first half , or second half , of the simulated data is used for analysis ( Fig . S4 ) , each of which samples different ranges of and . The two halves also provide similar values of , which would make it surprising if there is a strong coordinate-dependence in the vicinity of the classical configuration . Since the presented analysis indicates that , and capture diffusive aspects of ribosome dynamics , we will use them to relate the free-energy barriers and kinetics associated with translocation-related structural rearrangements . The rates of body rotation , head-swiveling , and tRNA displacements are related to the underlying free energy according to [2] , [3]: ( 3 ) where is , or . is the short-length scale averaged free energy as a function of each coordinate . is the effective diffusion coefficient in -space . Here , we simplify the integral by treating as a constant for each transition . While the diffusion may vary along each coordinate , the extent to which changes will be determined by the magnitude of the short-length scale roughness along each . Since the types of chemical interactions ( i . e . protein-RNA , or RNA-RNA interactions ) are similar during each rearrangement , including at the subunit bridges [21] , it is not expected that the coordinate dependence will be large for subunit rotation . To emphasize this point , it is instructive to consider protein folding studies , where coordinate-dependent diffusion has been detected through a variety of computational and experimental methods [41]–[46] , [55]–[58] . During protein folding , the polymer chain transits from an unfolded state , which is dominated by protein-solvent interactions , to a folded ensemble that is composed of protein-protein interaction . Despite this drastic change in the local chemical environment during folding , most studies have reported only modest changes in ( factors of 2–5 ) . In the present study of the ribosome , there are not large changes in the chemical composition of the subunit interfaces , making it reasonable to expect that the scale of the energetic roughness will not change significantly during each rearrangement . Nonetheless , since it is possible that there will be coordinate dependence , the presented estimates of should be considered baseline estimates . As the coordinate-dependence of the diffusion is characterized , the presented calculations may be further refined to provide a more precise relationship between the free energy and the kinetics . With the calculated values of , through numerical integration ( See Methods ) we calculated the rates of the rearrangements ( body and head rotation and tRNA displacements ) as functions of the barrier heights ( Fig . 5A–C ) . The rate of translocation has been reported to be , depending on the experimental conditions used [59]–[64] . By definition , each substep of translocation must be faster than the full process . Thus , our analysis indicates that the barriers for each substep are unlikely to exceed ( Fig . 5 ) . Diffusion leads to free-energy barrier-crossing attempts and the barrier height determines the probability of successfully crossing [1]–[3] , [49] , [57] , [65] . For a two-state transition ( i . e . two energetic basins separated by a single barrier ) the rate may be approximated in terms of an attempt frequency and free-energy barrier : , where and are the free energy of the initial ensemble and the TSE . is process-specific . For example , biomolecular folding is associated with prefactors of [1] , [57] , [66] , while simulations suggest attempt frequencies for tRNA accommodation of ( Ref . [49] ) . Similarly , the calculated values of and suggest that and ( Fig . 5 , is used for comparison ) . For tRNA displacements that occur during hybrid-state formation and translocation , suggests . It is notable that the values of are comparable for all three processes , even though they take place in distinct coordinate spaces and have unique values of . That is , the attempt frequencies are the result of both the magnitude of the diffusion , and the length scale of the rearrangement ( Eq . 3 ) . For these processes , the large rearrangements are accompanied by larger values for the diffusion , which leads to comparable attempt frequencies . In contrast , the attempt frequency for tRNA accommodation was found to be larger than for tRNA displacements associated with translocation . Since these processes occur on similar length-scales , this difference highlights the contribution of the diffusion coefficient to the attempt frequency . These similarities and differences between the attempt frequencies in each space demonstrate the balance between length scale , energetic roughness , diffusion and the free-energy barriers of conformational transitions in the ribosome . \\n The ability to rigorously interconvert between the energy landscape and kinetics will be essential in order to unambiguously quantify the features of the biomolecular landscapes that underpin function . With knowledge of the diffusive properties , theoretical and experimental probes of the energy landscape may be directly compared to kinetic measurements , which will enable a comprehensive picture of the landscape to emerge . Thus , the diffusion provides a unifying foundation for understanding and interpreting all available data for a given biological process . In the presented study , we have made the first steps towards establishing such a framework for tRNA translocation in the ribosome . To do this , we probed the diffusive characteristics of subunit rotations and tRNA displacements , essential sub-processes that facilitate protein elongation in the cell . As computer hardware continues to increase in power , and new computational algorithms and models are developed , the current study will provide the context for understanding a gamut of biophysical measurements and predictions . Of particular interest are the detailed features of the underlying energy landscape , as well as the robustness of ribosome dynamics to external perturbations . Similar to macroscopic machines , by understanding the interplay between the moving parts of these systems , it may be possible to design strategies to exploit this knowledge and provide precise regulation of biomolecular dynamics in the cell . In such efforts , the presented approach for bridging kinetics and free-energies provides a way to systematically verify predictions about the landscape against experimental data . These tools allow us to integrate complementary information from experimental and computational techniques , which will be crucial when identifying the features of the energy landscapes that govern biological function . \\n The simulation is a direct continuation of our previous 100 ns explicit-solvent simulation of the ribosome [67] . The simulation is based on the high resolution crystallographic structure of an E . coli ribosome in a pre-translocation ( classical A/A-P/P ) configuration ( PDB ID: 2I2P and 2I2T . [68] ) . The simulation was performed on 2048 ( on NMCAC Encanto ) and 1024 ( on TACC Lonestar ) compute cores using Gromacs v4 . 5 . 3 [69] , [70] , with a peak performance of 15 nanoseconds/day . The AMBER99p force field [71] , [72] was employed . [KCl] = 100 mM and , yielding 388 , 6272 and 2831 ions . 602587 SPC/E water molecules were included , for a total system size of 2070120 atoms . A 1 . 3 microsecond production run was performed with the Verlet integration scheme [73] and a 2 femtosecond time step . The NPT ensemble was sampled , where the system was coupled to a temperature bath of 300 K through use of the Nosé-Hoover thermostat [74] , [75] . Pressure coupling was achieved through employment of the Berendsen algorithm , with a pressure of 1 bar , relaxation time of 2 . 5 picoseconds , and compressibility of 4 . 5 [76] . While the choice of thermostat and barostat could impact the observed kinetic properties , both operate by modulating average quantities . Due to the large number of atoms in this system , fluctuations in the average quantities ( such as average kinetic energy per atom ) will be relatively small , and the coupling baths should have only a marginal effect on the kinetics . Supporting this , previous simulations of the A/A-P/P configuration [49] that used an alternate thermal coupling algorithm provided effective diffusion coefficients for movement along that were similar to the values reported here . Covalent bonds were constrained using the LINCS algorithm [77] , while the cutoff distances for the van der Waals and Coulomb interactions were both chosen to be 0 . 9 nm . The long-range electrostatic interactions were treated by the PME algorithm [78] , with a tolerance of and an interpolation order of 4 . Complete details on equilibration , structural modeling and the initial configuration may be found elsewhere [67] . During translocation by the ribosome , there are multiple large-scale rotary motions that facilitate tRNA movement ( Fig . 2 ) . To probe the collective rotary motions of the subunits , and exclude independent fluctuations of individual residues , we identified sets of core residues for the 50S subunit , 30S body and 30S head . In doing so , we only considered the rRNA portions of each region . These regions undergo sub-Å internal displacements , allowing their average orientations to be used to measure body and head rotation . To identify the core residues , we started with sets of candidate residues and then iteratively excluded highly-fluctuating ones , until a set was identified for which the rmsf is less than 1 Å for every residue . The following protocol was employed: Upon completion of this iterative-exclusion algorithm , there were 1353 , 443 and 178 rRNA residues in the core groups of the 50S , 30S body and 30S head ( Figs . 3B , 3C and S1; See Text S1 for list of core residues ) . To define the coordinates for rotation ( and ) , the core residue configurations were compared for classical and rotated configurations of the ribosome . First , for each structural model ( classical , body-rotated , head-rotated ) , reference configurations of the core residues were spatially aligned to the 23S , 16S body and 16S head regions . This initial alignment provided an average orientation ( i . e . the “idealized” coordinates ) of each group , thereby ensuring that the rotation metrics probe the collective rotation of the groups and not the independent fluctuations of individual atom . Next , the idealized coordinates were compared for each structural model . Specifically , to define , all possible vectors that can be defined by two P atoms in were calculated for the classical and body-rotated configuration . The atom-pair vector that undergoes the largest change in angle was then used to define the rotation plane for . An analogous strategy was used to define . All scripts necessary to calculate these angles will be made available online , upon publication . For complete details , see Text S1 . With values of , , and the rates of body rotation , head rotation , and tRNA displacements were calculated from Eq . 3 . When , the lower bound on the inside integral is , otherwise it is . Consistent with previous studies [49] , we numerically integrated Eq . 3 through the use of free-energy surfaces that have the functional form ( Fig . S5 ) , where is the position of the free-energy barrier and and were set such that the endpoints are minima . Other functional forms were considered ( Fig . S6 ) , however , for sufficiently large barriers , the functional form does not have a sizable effect on the rate [65] . This point was also explicitly shown in Ref . [49] . Based on the analysis of cryo-EM and x-ray models ( See Table S1 ) , the bounds of integration corresponded to changes in each coordinate of ( ) , ( ) and 22 Å ( ) . As discussed in the Results , the simulation was performed at 300 K ( ) , whereas many experiments are performed at . Accordingly , the diffusion coefficients presented here are slightly lower that what should be used when interpreting experiments at higher temperatures . For other kinetic models for which experimental data may become available , the limits of integration may be modified , thus providing a quantitative bridge between the landscape and kinetics for other kinetic representations of translocation . As expected from the arguments of Kramers [3] , [57] , [65] , for a substantial free-energy barrier ( ) separating two free-energy minima , the mean first passage time may be approximated according to the relation: ( 4 ) where , and are the curvatures of the free-energy surface in the initial basin and the TSE , and and are the diffusion and free energy of the TSE . Accordingly , for any relatively smooth function that has a single , well-defined peak separating two fixed endpoints , the curvature of the basin and TSE will be within a relatively small range of values . In the present study , we employed a symmetric functional form for the barrier ( Fig . S5 ) , in order to calculate the relationship between the rates and the free-energy surface . Previously , we explicitly calculated the rates using alternate symmetric functional forms , and found the rates to be robust [49] . Here , we have additionally calculated the rates for asymmetric barriers ( Fig . S6 ) , which further highlights the robustness of the rates to the functional form . That is , for a barrier separating two basins of attraction by 15 distance units ( e . g . ) , the calculated rates only vary by a factor of up to two when the free-energy peak is centered at 3 , 7 . 5 , or 12 distance units . Accordingly , for a given rate , the effect of this feature will only alter the predicted barrier height by a maximum of .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Functional rearrangements in biomolecular assemblies result from diffusion across an underlying energy landscape . While bulk kinetic measurements rely on discrete state-like approximations to the energy landscape , single-molecule methods can project the free energy onto specific coordinates . With measures of the diffusion , one may establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape . We used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome ( 2 . 1 million atoms; 1 . 3 microseconds ) to provide this bridge for specific conformational events associated with the process of tRNA translocation . Starting from a pre-translocation configuration , we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function . Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation were then used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape . This analysis , in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation , provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation . While this analysis was performed for a particular kinetic scheme of translocation , the quantitative framework is general and may be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Little is known about the molecular biology of medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) , which is a rare disease . Genomics are increasingly being used to improve our knowledge about disease biology and to identify therapeutic targets in many cancers . Here , we report the largest genomic results of MTC to date . MTC tissue frequently included several mutations . For the first time , anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangements were detected in MTC: one case with a glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK fusion , and another case with an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusion . The fusion mechanism of the novel GFPT1-ALK fusion was successfully investigated using molecular biology techniques . In addition , an inhibitor of ALK ( crizotinib ) dramatically decreased the number of metastatic MTC lesions harboring the EML4-ALK fusion , thus verifying the fusion as a promising target in MTC . Our findings suggest that using rapidly improving sequencing techniques and accumulated genomic data to comprehensively perform genetic analyses on rare tumors , such as MTC , will help to improve the poor prognosis of orphan diseases .</td>\n",
       "      <td>The genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) is not yet fully understood , although some oncogenic mutations have been identified . To explore genetic profiles of MTCs , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2 . Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced . We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples . The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene , which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ) , serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ) , v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ) , mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ) , Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ) and MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ) . We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH . To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5’ fusion partner of ALK , customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients . Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusions were identified . Additional PCR analysis , followed by Sanger sequencing , confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion , indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion . Notably , a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor , crizotinib . In conclusion , we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC . Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors . Furthermore , the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy . \\n Many cancer gene profiling studies have recently been published , describing genetic trends that are not limited to specific cancers . Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) is an important tool for detecting genetic alterations in many kinds of cancers , as it allows for millions of nucleic acid sequences to be simultaneously sequenced within a short period of time and is more cost-effective than older methods . Thus , many researchers and physicians anticipate that NGS will bring the concept of personalized cancer therapy to fruition . Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) is a rare malignancy that accounts for up to 3–5% of thyroid cancers . It is derived from calcitonin-secreting para-follicular C cells and can arise in a familial ( 25% ) or sporadic ( 75% ) pattern . Genetic and epigenetic alterations play important roles in the progression and prognosis of MTC [1–3] . Genes encoding the ret proto-oncogene ( RET ) and Ras ( RAS ) are commonly mutated in MTC [4 , 5] . The RET mutation is believed to be a causative event in both familial and sporadic MTC [6 , 7] . In the Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway , the RAS mutation is another genetic rearrangement that is prevalent in sporadic MTC and other types of thyroid cancer [2] but the prevalence and significance of other genetic mutations including BRAF in MTC remain unclear . MTC has a different response to treatment than that of well-differentiated thyroid cancers . Because radioactive iodine does not accumulate in MTC , few therapeutic options are available for advanced MTC . Inhibitors of RET , such as cabozantinib and vandetanib , have recently been shown to be effective in advanced MTC [8 , 9] . However , whether the RET mutation is a predictive factor for the success of these drugs is unclear [9] . Recently , the rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) was detected in a small but significant proportion of patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [10] . Several ALK inhibitors , including crizotinib , have achieved dramatic responses in cases of NSCLC harboring ALK rearrangements [11–13] . Although ALK rearrangement has also been episodically observed in a small set of other cancer types , little is known about ALK rearrangements in MTC [14 , 15] . In this study , we used targeted NGS and various methods to examine the genetic profiles of MTC and detect ALK rearrangements . \\n Eighty-four samples ( 11 hereditary , 41 sporadic and 32 unknown ) from patients with MTC ( mean age of 48 . 5 years ) and 36 paired normal thyroid tissue samples were successfully sequenced . The normal thyroid tissue samples in the MTC patients were used as matched control samples . Of the cases , 32 were male and 52 were female . Detailed demographic , clinic-pathological and genetic characteristics are listed in Table 1 and S2 Table . Hereditary MTCs were defined as cases having either positive germ-line RET mutations in blood tests or possession of a strong family history with MTC in at least four family members [16] . The unknown group was composed of MTC cases with no blood RET test and no family history of MTC/MEN . The mean value of variant coverage was 593 reads , and the variant coverage ranged from 19 to 1 , 482 reads . Overall , 101 mutations were observed in the MTC samples . Most mutations ( N = 96 , 95 . 0% ) were single-nucleotide variants; 5 were deletions . The most common mutation occurred in RET , which was observed in 47 cases , followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ) , serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ) , v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ) , mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ) , Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ) , MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ) , ATM serine/threonine kinase ( N = 2 ) , kinase insert domain receptor ( N = 2 ) , adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC; N = 2 ) , B-raf proto-oncogene ( N = 1 ) , cadherin 1 ( N = 1 ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( N = 1 ) , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A ( CDKN2A , N = 1 ) , Janus kinase 3 ( N = 1 ) , protein tyrosine phosphatase , non-receptor type 1 ( N = 1 ) , SMAD family member 4 ( N = 1 ) and von Hippel-Lundau tumor suppressor ( N = 1 ) . We did not detect any dominant gene mutations in 20 MTC samples , which all exhibited wild-type RET , HRAS and KRAS . These are listed in S1 Table and shown in Fig 1 . The commonly observed RET mutations occurred in exons 10 , 11 , 15 , and 16 . Previous studies have shown that M918T is the most common RET mutation in MTC [2 , 10] . Similarly , M918T ( N = 19 ) was the most common RET mutation in our samples , followed by C634Y ( N = 7 ) , C634W ( N = 4 ) , C634G ( N = 4 ) , C630R ( N = 4 ) , D631Y ( N = 2 ) , and others ( N = 7 ) . All HRAS mutations occurred in exon 3 . The mutant amino acid sequence in each of the HRAS mutant cases was Q61K ( N = 13 ) . KRAS mutations were observed in three cases ( Q61R , 2 and G48R , 1 ) , and BRAF mutation was found in only one case . The dominant amino acid sequence in STK11 was F354L ( N = 7 ) . Other mutated genes are shown in S1 Table . We compared the genetic landscapes between 36 MTC tissues and their matched normal thyroid tissues: this group was composed of 16 sporadic , 5 hereditary and 15 cases with unknown information about heredity ( Fig 2 ) . In the hereditary MTC cases , RET mutations were observed in MTC and their matched normal thyroid tissues: these RET mutation types included C634Y , D631Y , and C634W , which are well known to be associated with the MEN2A [17 , 18] . One case , which had been classified as an unknown subgroup based on blood test or family history , was found to have C634W mutation in both MTC and normal tissue , leading us to suspect that this case might be hereditary MTC . In 16 sporadic MTC group , several RET mutation types ( M918T , C630R , C618S and deletion ) were detected in MTC tissues , but not in the matched normal thyroid tissues . The M918T RET mutations and Q61K HRAS mutations were observed only in the MTCs of the sporadic or unknown subgroups , suggesting that these mutations are pathognomonic somatic mutation in MTC . In addition , two KRAS ( G48R , Q61R ) and one MET ( A986T ) mutations were also observed only in MTC tissues . However , STK11 ( F354L ) , MLH1 , KIT , and KDR mutations were observed in both MTC and normal thyroid tissues , which leads their pathognomonic natures unresolved in MTC . In parallel with targeted sequencing using AmpliSeq , we screened for ALK rearrangements . Ninety-eight cases were screened using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , and 83 of these cases were also evaluated using AmpliSeq . Nine ALK-positive cases were found with IHC scores of 1+ ( N = 7 ) , 2+ ( N = 1 ) , and 3+ ( N = 1 ) . We also performed ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) testing on ALK-positive samples that were identified via IHC . The two samples with 2+ and 3+ IHC scores exhibited ALK break-apart rearrangements ( Fig 3 ) . For the two cases harboring ALK break-apart rearrangements , targeted cancer panel sequencing ( HiSeq 2500 , Illumina , USA ) was performed to detect the breakpoints and 5’ fusion partner genes of ALK . This process revealed two distinct ALK fusions . For the first case , a novel fusion gene was detected: 5’ glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1; located in 2p13 ) was fused to 3’ ALK ( located in 2p23 ) with preservation of the ALK kinase domain ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . The breakpoints in GFPT1 and ALK were in intron 18 and exon 20 , respectively . Based on the gene direction and location , the structural variation was presumed to be intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion . To confirm the fusion , we amplified the genomic fusion point between GFPT1 and ALK using genomic DNA of the MTC tissue . PCR analysis and Sanger sequencing revealed the same results as that of the customized targeted cancer panel ( Figs 4B and S1 ) . For the second case , the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusion was detected . The breakpoints were located in intron 13 of EML4 and intron 19 of ALK , which indicates that this fusion is the most common variant ( E13; A20 ) in NSCLC [19 , 20] . This case exhibited metastatic lesions after thyroidectomy and was enrolled in a Phase I crizotinib trial ( NCT01121588 ) . After crizotinib therapy , the tumor lesions in the lung , liver , and bone shrank remarkably , and plasma calcitonin levels decreased . The final results will be disclosed with the full clinical study . \\n We identified two types of ALK fusion genes in MTC by sequencing via IHC , FISH , and NGS analyses . Of the two fusion types , the EML4-ALK fusion was the same as the most commonly detected variant in NSCLC , [19] where the EML4-ALK fusion is a strong predictive factor for the efficacy of ALK inhibitors [13 , 21 , 22] . In the current study , the patient with metastatic MTC harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to crizotinib . We are the first to report an MTC case with a targetable EML4-ALK fusion gene . Previously , Kelly et al . used the Illumina HiSeq sequencing system to identify one papillary thyroid cancer case with an EML4-ALK fusion [15] . However , they also tested 22 medullary carcinoma cases and did not find any cases with the EML4-ALK fusion , as evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR . Their failure to detect the ALK rearrangement in MTC is understandable , given that our prevalence rate of ALK fusions in the current study was only 2% ( 2 out of 98 cases ) . This suggests that more efficient strategies are needed to detect the ALK rearrangement . Results from the current study suggest that IHC-based screening , along with FISH-based confirmation and targeted NGS , may be a cost-effective and reliable method to detect ALK rearrangements . Most importantly , we detected a novel GFPT1-ALK fusion that has not been reported in any type of cancer . GFPT1 is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of N-acetylglucosamine and is required for critical events in neuromuscular transmission [23] . Until now , several fusion partners of ALK have been reported in various cancers [24–28] . Among them , huntingdon-interacting protein ( HIP1 ) -ALK and RAN-binding protein 2 ( RANBP2 ) -ALK , which have been reported to exist in NSCLC and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors , respectively , show clinical responses to crizotinib [25 , 26] . In the current study , the MTC case harboring the GFPT1-ALK fusion showed strong ALK protein expression and did not exhibit co-existing genetic mutations; both of these factors may support an important role for this fusion gene in the pathogenesis of this MTC case . However , we were unable to validate whether GFPT1-ALK was a driving oncogene or a therapeutically targetable gene . Whether GFPT1-ALK is also a predictor for ALK inhibitors is unclear . Currently , vandetanib and cabozantinib are approved for the treatment of MTC by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration . However , the prognosis of patients with metastatic MTC is still poor , due to the inherent resistance to radioiodine therapy and aggressive nature of this disease . Furthermore , the rarity of MTC makes it hard to perform prospective studies to find new agents . Therefore , the comprehensive genetic analysis of MTC can help to identify effective ways to improve its prognosis . Despite the low frequency of ALK rearrangements in MTC , our techniques can be used to detect target genes in other rare diseases . In addition , our sequencing analysis of MTC is the largest to date . Previously , Agrawal et al . published the largest genomic analysis of MTC [5] , where they performed whole-exome sequencing of 17 sporadic MTCs and 40 additional MTCs ( hereditary or sporadic ) for validation . RET was the dominant mutation ( 43/57 ) in that study . We used a larger sample size and accurate verification by comparing 36 pairs of MTC with matched normal thyroid tissues that were acquired from the same person . In the comparison analyses , all five hereditary cases were observed to have germ-line RET mutations in both MTC and control tissues . However , M918T RET ( N = 10 ) , Q61K HRAS ( N = 7 ) , KRAS ( N = 2 ) , and MET ( N = 1 ) mutations were harbored dominantly in MTCs . Simbolo et al . identified RET , HRAS , KRAS and STK11 mutations as significant somatic mutations in MTCs , whereas TP53 , KDR , KIT , MET , PIK3CA and ATM mutations were classified as nonpathogenic germ-line variants [29] . Our current data are compatible with that report . Interestingly , however , the F354L STK11 mutation , regarded as significant somatic mutation by Simbolo et al . , was observed in both MTCs and control tissues of our seven cases . Therefore , we presume that the F354L STK11 mutation is a germ-line mutation in MTC . In conclusion , we report that the EML4-ALK fusion , which was found for the first time in MTC , could be an effective molecular target of crizotinib . Furthermore , our results also suggest that the novel GFPT1-ALK fusion can be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy . This study included the largest set of molecular profile data in MTC to date , which was achieved by using high-depth NGS panel sequencing , and also presented the genetic landscape of MTC . Further translational research is needed to determine the oncogenic roles of these mutations in MTC . \\n Written informed consent was obtained from all participants , and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center . ( SMC 2013-02-010 ) . We collected data on patients who were histologically diagnosed with MTC without the coexistence of tumors on the parathyroid and adrenal gland . All patients received surgical treatment at Samsung Medical Center between June 2000 and January 2013 . Among 101 MTC specimens , 17 were excluded based on quality control ( N = 5 ) , preparation failure ( N = 11 ) , and sequencing failure ( N = 1 ) . The remaining 84 MTC samples were sequenced using an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine ( IT-PGM , Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY , USA ) , which takes real-time measurements of hydrogen ions that are produced during DNA replication and allows for rapid sequencing . Eight normal thyroid tissues were obtained by thyroidectomy and sequenced . Mutation profiles between MTC and normal thyroid tissues from eight individuals were compared . We constructed libraries using the Ion AmpliSeq Panels , Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit , and Ion Xpress Barcodes , as well as 10 ng of DNA sample per pool ( Life Technologies ) . The amplicons were ligated to Ion Adapters and purified . For barcoded library preparations , barcoded adapters from the Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters 1–96 Kit were substituted for the non-barcoded adapter mix in the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit . Next , the multiplexed barcoded libraries were enriched by clonal amplification using emulsion polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) on Ion Sphere Particles ( Ion PGM Template 200 Kit ) and loaded on an Ion 316 Chip . Massively parallel sequencing was carried out on an Ion PGM using the Ion PGM Sequencing 200 Kit v2 . The Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 covered hotspot regions of 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes . The primary filtering process was performed with the Torrent Suite v4 . 0 . 0 and Ion Torrent Variant Caller v4 . 0 software and included signal processing , base calling , assigning quality scores , adapter trimming , PCR duplicate removal , read alignment ( to human genome reference 19 ) , mapping quality control , coverage analyzing , and variant calling [30] . To detect variants , a minimum coverage of 100 reads was achieved with a cutoff value of at least 5% in the variant calling rate ( frequency ) . Variant calls were further analyzed by using ANNOVAR variant filtering and COSMIC database ( dbSNP build 137 ) annotating , and these analyses were based on changes in the amino acid sequence . The ALK IHC assay used a mouse monoclonal ALK antibody ( 5A4 , Novocastra , Newcastle , United Kingdom ) and the antibody for ALK was diluted to 1:30 , treated , and incubated at 42°C for 2 hours . ALK IHC scores were assigned as follows: 0 , no staining; 1+ , faint or weak staining intensity with more than 5% tumor cells or any staining intensity with ≤5% tumor cells; 2+ , moderate cytoplasmic reactivity with more than 5% tumor cells; and 3+ , granular cytoplasmic reactivity of strong intensity in more than 5% of tumor cells [31] . Cases that showed ALK-positive staining with a score of 1+ or greater were analyzed by FISH with the Vysis ALK Break-Apart FISH Probe Kit ( Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , IL ) . Samples were considered positive for ALK FISH if more than 15% of cells were positive or an isolated red signal ( IRS ) in tumor cells . Genomic DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp DNA mini kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The Nanodrop 8000 UV-Vis spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific Inc . , DE , USA ) , Qubit 2 . 0 Fluorometer ( Life Technologies ) , and 2200 TapeStation Instrument ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) were used to check the concentration , purity , and degradation of extracted genomic DNA . For the next step , samples that passed our quality control thresholds were used . Genomic DNA ( 250 ng ) from the tissues was sheared by the Covaris S220 ( Covaris , Woburn , MA , USA ) and used for the construction of the library using customized RNA baits and the SureSelect XT reagent kit , HSQ ( Agilent Technologies ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The customized RNA baits covered whole exons and flanking intronic sequences of the 83 genes . After enriched exome libraries were multiplexed , the libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform ( Illumina , USA ) , as described previously [32] . Briefly , a paired-end DNA sequencing library was prepared through the following processes: genomic DNA shearing , end-repair , A-tailing , paired-end adaptor ligation , and amplification . After the library was hybridized with bait sequences for 16 hours , the captured library was purified and amplified with an index barcode tag . Then , the quality and quantity of the captured library were measured . Sequencing of the exome library was carried out using the 100-bp , paired-end mode of the TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster kit and TruSeq Rapid SBS kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . The newly identified glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK fusion gene was detected by targeted cancer panel sequencing , and its respective genomic rearrangement was confirmed by genomic PCR analysis , followed by Sanger sequencing . Genomic DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor samples using a ReliaPrep FFPE genomic DNA extraction kit ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) . The PCR products were indicative of fusion points within intron 18 of GFPT1 and exon 20 of ALK , based on target sequencing results . PCR analysis of genomic DNA for GFPT1-ALK was performed with a pair of primers flanking the putative fusion point: GFPT1 F ( 5’-TCTGTGTGAACTGGCACCTT-3’ ) and ALK R ( 5’-ATTCAGCCCCTACACTGCAC-3’ ) . PCR products were then separated on a 2% E-Gel SizeSelect agarose gel ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . For genomic PCR controls , we used DNA from the same FFPE tumor samples with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR primers . In reactions that produced a PCR product of the expected size , the amplicons underwent gel purification and sequencing using a 3130 XL ABI Prism sequencer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) with Bigdye Terminator v3 . 1 Cycle sequencing kits , according to the manufacturer’s instructions .</td>\n",

       "      <td>The genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) is not yet fully understood , although some oncogenic mutations have been identified . To explore genetic profiles of MTCs , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2 . Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced . We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples . The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene , which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ) , serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ) , v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ) , mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ) , Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ) and MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ) . We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH . To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5’ fusion partner of ALK , customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients . Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusions were identified . Additional PCR analysis , followed by Sanger sequencing , confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion , indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion . Notably , a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor , crizotinib . In conclusion , we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC .

       "      <td>Asymptomatic leishmaniasis may drive the epidemic and an important challenge to reach the goal of joint Visceral Leishmaniasis ( VL ) elimination initiative taken by three Asian countries . The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission , prognosis at individual level and rate of transformation to symptomatic VL/Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) needs to be evaluated . Asymptomatic cases were diagnosed by active mass survey in eight tribal villages by detecting antileishmanial antibody using rK39 based rapid diagnostic kits and followed up for three years to observe the pattern of sero-conversion and disease transformation . Out of 2890 total population , 2603 were screened . Antileishmanial antibody was detected in 185 individuals of them 96 had a history of VL/PKDL and 89 without such history . Seventy nine such individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis and ten as active VL with a ratio of 7 . 9:1 . Out of 79 asymptomatic cases 2 were lost to follow up as they moved to other places . Amongst asymptomatically infected persons , disease transformation in 8/77 ( 10 . 39% ) and sero-conversion in 62/77 ( 80 . 52% ) cases were noted . Seven ( 9 . 09% ) remained sero-positive even after three years . Progression to clinical disease among asymptomatic individuals was taking place at any time up to three years after the baseline survey . If there are no VL /PKDL cases for two or more years , it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years , if there are such asymptomatic cases . So , asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme that has been initiated by three adjoining endemic countries . \\n Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a vector-borne protozoal disease caused by the Leishmania donovani species complex . Estimated 200000–400000 new cases are recorded per year worldwide [1] of which 67% of the total cases are contributed by three Asian countries India , Nepal , and Bangladesh . In this part of the world L . donovani is the only causative agent of VL , Phlebotomus argentipes is the only known vector and the only reservoir is human [2 , 3] . Availability of reliable , effective and safer drugs like oral miltefosine and liposomal amphotericine for treatment , indoor residual spray for vector control and antigen based rapid diagnostic test kits ( rK39 ) usable at field level makes the disease as a candidate for elimination [4 , 5] . On this background India , Nepal , and Bangladesh launched a joint VL elimination initiative in 2005 with a target of bringing the incidence down to less than 1 case per 10 , 000 population by 2015 [6] . This elimination initiative faced an important challenge due to asymptomatic infection . L . donovani infection results into a full-blown symptomatic disease or asymptomatic carrier without any clinical manifestations for a long period . Asymptomatic leishmaniasis is not well defined; generally it is described by a positive serological test , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , or leishmanin skin test ( LST ) in individuals who are apparently in a healthy condition [7 , 8] . In an endemic area , most of L . donovani infections remain asymptomatic [9] . Cross-sectional surveys based on serological studies showed that a high proportion of serologically positive persons are asymptomatic [10–17] . Mathematical modeling shows that asymptomatic carriers , constituting a reservoir of parasites , may drive the epidemic in future [18] , although their infectiousness to sand flies is yet to be established . Several prospective studies have documented the ratio of asymptomatic infection to incident clinical VL cases as 1:2 . 4 to 5 . 6:1 in African countries [19–21] , 18:1 to 50:1 in South American and European countries [22 , 23] and 3 . 8:1 to 8 . 9:1 in Asian countries [24–26] . The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission , the prognosis of these cases at the individual level and the rate of transformation to symptomatic VL/PKDL needs to be evaluated . The present study was designed to determine the actual burden of the asymptomatic cases and pattern of disease progression ( development of signs and symptoms of VL or PKDL ) , and rate of sero-conversion ( serologically positive to negative ) among them in an endemic area of Malda district , West Bengal . \\n Depending upon the records of State/District health offices about VL/PKDL cases during past few years , eight tribal villages of three sub-centres of Malda district were selected . The district Malda is situated just north to the river Ganges; it has an international border with Bangladesh in the East and an interstate border with Bihar in the West which is endemic for leishmaniasis ( Fig 1 ) . Before initiation of the mass survey population of the villages were sensitized and explained about the objectives of the study and were requested to participate . Volunteers were selected from the population and trained about the study protocol and grouped into three member teams leaded by one person from project staff / an investigator from Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine . The teams made complete census of the study population by house-to-house visit and filled up a questionnaire in a printed book , about history of VL/PKDL and treatment received , age , sex , presence / history of fever , occupation , level of education . After obtaining verbal consent from the head of the family and also from each individual , rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) based on rK39 was done for the detection of anti-leishmanial antibody . All RDT positive persons were examined clinically for the detection of probable cases of VL/PKDL . Suspected such cases were subjected for parasitological investigation and referred to their local primary health centres ( PHCs ) for treatment . Apparently healthy person positive for antileishmanial antibody were classified as asymptomatic cases and were followed up to record the development of any sign of VL or PKDL and to study the pattern of sero-conversion during three study years . The ethical aspect of the study was described earlier [35] . In brief , the objectives of the study were explained to the village population by the study team headed by a medical doctor from Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine . The selected population was invited to participate into the study . They were also informed that their identity would not be disclosed in any way and they could withdraw from the study at any time without any explanation . Written informed consent was obtained from antileishmanial antibody positive cases or from their legal guardians of the child below the age of 14 years , having no history of kala azar detected by mass screening . There were three such cases between the age group of 14 to 17 years and informed written consent was obtained from them in presence of their legal guardians . Such cases were examined clinically for detection of sign and symptoms of active VL and asymptomatic VL cases were followed up for three years . The Ethics Committee of the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine reviewed and approved the study protocol . All the identified asymptomatic VL cases were followed up both clinically and serologically on 3rd , 6th , 12th , 18th , 24th , 30th and 36th month of the study to know the rate of progression to clinical disease and sero-conversion . All diagnosed VL and PKDL cases were treated with either Sodium Stibo Gluconate ( SSG ) or miltefosine as per National Vector Born Disease Control Program ( NVBDCP ) of India . Drugs were supplied by Dy . Director of Health Services , Malaria , State Programme Officer , Government of West Bengal . \\n The study was undertaken during September 2012 to August 2015 in eight tribal villages of Malda district , West Bengal . In all villages under study , the houses are made of mud or brick . The source of drinking water in those villages is tube well and household works are done by pond water . Most of the houses have cattle sheds . Pig rearing is the common practice in all villages . Most of the peoples are agricultural or migratory labour by profession . Total population of the study village was 2890 ( 1439 male and 1451 female ) among them 2603 population was screened for antileishmanial antibody . A total of 185 individuals were positive for antileishmanial antibody , of them 96 had a history of kala-azar/PKDL and 89 without any history of kala-azar ( KA ) . Individuals ( n = 89 ) having no past KA history were examined clinically for fever/ history of fever , pallor , hepato-splenomegaly by clinicians of the team . Ten such individuals were diagnosed as active VL and were treated with sodium stibo gluconate ( SSG ) as mentioned earlier . Remaining 79 cases were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis with a prevalence of 3 . 16% ( 79/2497 ) among the healthy individuals , of them 43 was male and 36 female . The demographic parameters of asymptomatic cases are given in Table 1 . The ratio of asymptomatic infection to incidence active VL cases was 7 . 9:1 at that time in the study population . Healthy individuals having no signs and symptoms of VL or PKDL but positive for antileishmanial antibody were classified as asymptomatic infection . Among the asymptomatic cases who became serologically negative during follow up period were referred as sero-conversion and those developed the signs and symptoms of VL or PKDL as disease progression . All asymptomatic individuals ( n = 79 ) were followed up both clinically and serologically at a regular interval of six months for three years to determine the rate of sero-positive to sero-negative and also to record the progression from asymptomatic infection to symptomatic VL or PKDL . During 36 months of follow up visit , 2 asymptomatic cases were lost to follow up as they moved to other places . Symptoms of VL developed in 7 ( 9 . 09% , 7/77 ) asymptomatically infected individuals , one after 6 months , two after 12 months , one after 18 months , three after 30 months . During 36 months follow up , sign of PKDL was observed in one asymptomatic case which was parasitologicaly confirmed by the demonstration of amastigotes in skin scrapping smear . The patient was examined thoroughly but did not show any symptoms of VL—like fever , history of fever during last one month and splenomegaly . A total of 62 ( 80 . 52% ) cases became sero-negative , 14 after 24 months , 27 after 30 months and 21 after 36 months follow up period . Interestingly 7 ( 9 . 09% ) individuals still remained positive serologically even after three years . So they need more follow up period . The patterns of sero-conversion and progression to clinical disease of the asymptomatic individuals are given in Fig 2 . Out of 17 VL case , 10 were treated with SSG and remaining 7 with miltefosine ( MIL ) . All the patients responded to their respective chemotherapy provided and no sign of PKDL was recorded among them during three years of the study . \\n The development of full blown VL/KA from the initial infection by the bite of an infected sand fly is a complex phenomenon and it takes few months to years . Several factors like host’s immunity [27] and nutritional status [28 , 29] play an important role in it . In an endemic area a large number of individuals are asymptomatic with positive for antileishmanial antibodies . These individuals are apparently healthy and are not attending any health care system for diagnosis . The rate of such infection varies from region to region . In the present study we observed a prevalence rate of 3 . 16% ( 79/2497 ) asymptomatic leishmanial infection among the healthy population screened which is lower than the range of 5 . 62% - 13 . 8% detected by a no . of studies in Bihar using rK-39-ICT [30] . The ratio of asymptomatic infection with symptomatic cases was 7 . 9:1 . Similar ratio of asymptomatic infection was also reported from India and Nepal [25] , whereas a lower ratio was also reported from other parts of India and Bangladesh [24 , 26] . A higher ratio was also reported from Brazil and Spain [22 , 23] which might be due to different parasite species i . e . L . infantum with distinct life cycle to that of L . donovani in India . This ratio of asymptomatic infection to disease may differ from village to village within the same population has been reported by Khalil et al . , 2002 [31] due to different risk factors like contact of VL , presence of other seropositive cases , family size , house type , cattle rearing and poverty [30] . India , Nepal , and Bangladesh took an initiative to eliminate VL by 2015 from this part of the World [6] . Asymptomatic infection is one of the great challenges faced by this initiative . Several questions remained unresolved regarding these asymptomatic infections—whether these persons are infectious to the sand flies ? Who among the asymptomatically infected people will develop VL and when [14] . Which infection remains asymptomatic and how long [27] . Population-based long term prospective epidemiological studies are needed to answer these . In the present study we observed that 14 ( 18 . 18% ) asymptomatic individuals became sero-negative after two years and 48 ( 62 . 34% ) after three years of initial diagnosis . Most importantly 7 ( 9 . 09% ) still remained sero-positive even after three years , which requires more follow up , but how long , it is difficult to say . In a prospective study in India and Nepal Ostyn et al . , 2011 [25] observed a higher rate of sero-eversion ( 86 . 7% ) among asymptomatic infections within one year . Similar observation was also made in Brazil and Kenya [22 , 20] . In the present study , symptomatic VL developed in 7 ( 9 . 09% ) asymptomatic cases during three years of follow up . The proportion asymptomatic VL infection that progress to clinical disease within one year was 3 . 9% which is within the range of 1 . 5% - 23 . 1% as recorded in Bihar studies [30] . A study from Bihar , India by Topno et al . , 2010 [26] showed that clinical VL developed in 7 ( 18 . 42% ) of the 38 asymptomatic individuals in less than 6 months of initial diagnosis . The rate of progression to disease was 17 . 85/1000 PY , similar observation was also made from another parts of India and Nepal [25] and also from Brazil [22 , 32] . Topno et al . , 2010 [26] also reported that no new cases of VL were developed after six months follow up of asymptomatic cases . In contrast , in the present study we recorded longer latent period for L . donovani infection . In addition 7 ( 8 . 9% ) cases remained asymptomatic after three years . Our study showed that progression to clinical disease among rK39-positive asymptomatic cases taking place at any time , up to three or more years after the baseline survey which is similar to that observed by Gidwani et al . , 2009 [14] in Bihar . Most important aspect is the development of PKDL in one of the asymptomatic cases after three years of initial diagnosis . PKDL is considered as a reservoir for transmission of VL [33–35] as the parasites are easily available to the vector sandfly . We have reported a high prevalence of PKDL from the same study area previously [36] . So long term prospective studies are required to observe the fate of all asymptomatic cases . Scientists used different tools for diagnosis of asymptomatic infection like DAT , rK39 and PCR . In the present study we used rK39 based rapid diagnostic kit for this purpose . It is easier to perform at the field level without any invasive method and it does not required any sophisticated laboratory facilities like to that of PCR based diagnosis . In a given period if there are no cases of VL/PKDL for two or more years , it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years , if there are such asymptomatic cases . So , asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme that has been initiated by three adjoining endemic countries . If we allow these individuals to stay in the community , there might be a chance of epidemic in future . Though the available antileishmanial drugs are costly and toxic , but a case control study by treating all asymptomatic cases with single dose liposomal amphotericin in a given geographical area may enlighten the role of such intervention for elimination to eradication of leishmaniasis .</td>\n",

Our previous study found that the presence of a Ty912 element on a nonessential arm of chromosome V resulted in increased rates of non-reciprocal monocentric translocations arising from recombination between the Ty912 on chromosome V and ectopic Ty elements on other chromosomes . Using MLPA , we observed that the majority of the translocations targeted six different translocation hotspots even though there were at least 254 potential targets for Ty-mediated translocations in the S . cerevisiae genome . Most of the observed translocations were formed by RAD52-dependent recombination , although we also identified a RAD52-independent recombination pathway that promoted the formation of the same types of translocations at lower rates . Finally , we found that defects in the ASF1-RTT109–dependent histone H3 lysine 56 ( H3K56 ) acetylation pathway caused increased rates of both Ty-mediated translocations and whole-chromosome duplications ( aneuploidy ) . This aneuploidy often occurred simultaneously with Ty-mediated translocations .

Using MLPA , we found that the distribution of translocations induced by the presence of Ty912 in a wild-type strain was nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes , even though there were 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S . cerevisiae genome . While the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination , we observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements . The formation of these RAD52-independent translocations did not require the Rad51 or Rad59 homologous pairing proteins or the Rad1–Rad10 endonuclease complex that processes branched DNAs during recombination . Finally , we found that defects in ASF1-RTT109–dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 ( H3K56 ) resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications , and resulted in aneuploidy that tended to occur simultaneously with GCRs . Overall , we found that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy . \\n Genome stability is important for normal cellular survival and growth . In contrast , genome instability is associated with abnormal cellular growth . For example , tumor cells often contain multiple genome rearrangements and/or exhibit aneuploidy , and such events are thought to contribute to the development and progression of cancer [1]–[4] . Genome rearrangements are also associated with inborn genetic diseases . For instance , copy number changes mediated by segmental duplications are associated with a diversity of genetic diseases [5] and whole chromosome aneuploidy can cause diseases like Down Syndrome [6] . While the association of genome rearrangements and aneuploidy with human genetic disease is well established , the genetic factors that suppress or enhance genome rearrangements and aneuploidy are less well understood . We previously developed quantitative genetic assays for measuring the rates at which GCRs occur in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These assays , and modified versions of them , select for progeny that lose a nonessential chromosome arm due to a GCR mediated by either non-repetitive [7]–[10] , low-copy repeat [9] , [11] , or high-copy repeat DNA [12] and allow quantitative genetic analysis of the pathways that suppress or promote the formation of GCRs [13] . Genetic studies using these assays have revealed that numerous genes and pathways contribute to genome stability by suppressing the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements ( GCRs ) and/or the loss or gain of whole chromosomes [7] , [11] , [14]–[22] . To fully understand the mechanisms by which GCRs are formed , it is often necessary to determine their structures and sequence their rearrangement breakpoints . However , such analysis of rearranged genomes remains a challenge , particularly due to the large number that must be analyzed to determine the mechanisms by which the GCRs were formed . A number of different techniques have been used to analyze the structure of GCRs including: 1 ) Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis ( PFGE ) to determine the size of rearranged chromosomes [12] , [15] , [23]–[27]; 2 ) different methods for PCR amplification and sequencing of rearrangement breakpoints [7] , [11] , [12] , [20]–[23] , [26]–[28]; 3 ) cloning and/or restriction mapping of rearrangement breakpoints [12] , [14] , [15]; 4 ) array Comparative Genomic Hybridization ( aCGH ) that allows for the identification of regions of copy number change but does not provide information about connectivity of the rearranged regions [12] , [14] , [15] , [23] , [26] , [27]; and 5 ) next-generation DNA sequencing , which has the potential to provide considerable detail about the structure of genome rearrangements [29] . However , all of these methods fail to scale when analyzing a large number of rearranged genomes , due to either high costs or the tedious natures of the methods . In this study , we adapted a PCR-based method , Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ) , to supplement the analysis of Ty1-mediated GCRs in a manner that scales well in terms of both cost and time . MLPA is a multiplex ligation-dependent amplification technique that has been used to identify duplications , deletions , and aneuploidy in human cells [30]–[32] . Briefly , multiple pairs of oligonucleotide probes are designed such that each probe in a pair hybridizes next to the other member of the pair at regions of interest in the genome . The total length of each pair of probes is distinct and is used to identify specific regions in the genome on the basis of the length of the final MLPA product . The probes are hybridized to genomic DNA , and then adjacent probes are ligated and amplified using a common pair of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide primers . Products are separated and their length and fluorescent intensities measured using capillary electrophoresis . Analysis of the fluorescent intensities allows the determination of copy number differences between control and experimental samples . The main advantage of MLPA is its ability to provide copy number variation data for targeted regions in a rapid , inexpensive , and highly parallel manner . While MLPA does not provide the dense genome-wide coverage of aCGH or next-generation sequencing , it can cover multiple regions of interest simultaneously at a density sufficient for many types of genetic studies . In the present study we demonstrate the utility of MLPA for analyzing GCRs by investigating the target site bias of Ty1-mediated GCRs , RAD52-independent formation of Ty1-mediated translocations , and aneuploidy induced by deletion of RTT109 , a gene encoding a histone acetyltransferase . \\n In previous work we demonstrated that insertion of Ty912 between CIN8 and NPR2 in a nonessential terminal region of chromosome V ( the +Ty912 GCR assay ) ( Figure 1a ) , led to an increase in the rate of accumulating GCRs [12] . When we screened 88 independent GCR-containing strains derived from either wild-type or one of 11 different mutant strains , we found that all ( 88 of 88 ) of these GCR-containing strains contained a deletion of chromosome V from Ty912 to TEL05L ( the left telomere of chromosome V ) and almost all ( 82 of 88 ) of these GCR-containing strains also contained a duplicated region from another chromosome arm bounded by an ectopic Ty1 , Ty2 , or solo delta sequence at one end and a telomere at the other end . Structural studies demonstrated that these duplication-containing strains each contained a translocation consisting of the centromere-containing fragment of chromosome V joined to the duplicated region of the target chromosome , with a junction involving Ty912 and the bounding ectopic Ty element of the duplicated region . 94% of the translocations were simple translocations with a single junction involving Ty912 and a single target ectopic Ty element and 6% appeared to involve a dicentric translocation intermediate that underwent secondary rearrangements . In addition , each GCR-containing strain also contained a wild-type copy of the chromosome from which the duplicated sequence was derived . Overall , this analysis indicated that all of the Ty912-mediated translocations observed were formed by a non-reciprocal recombination-mediated translocation mechanism . To better characterize the distribution of the observed chromosome arm duplications , we developed a MLPA probe set capable of identifying duplicated and deleted chromosome arms . A “telomeric” probe set was designed to identify copy number changes at genomic loci located at the ends of each chromosome arm in S . cerevisiae . The probes were designed to hybridize between the telomeres of each chromosome and their closest respective Ty1 , Ty2 , or solo delta element ( Figure 1b , 1c ) ; however , four probes ( chrII-L , chrIV-R , chrIX-R , and chrXV-L ) could not be designed to meet this criterion due to the lack of suitable non-repetitive DNA regions near the telomeres of these chromosome arms , and were instead designed to hybridize immediately centromeric to the terminal Ty elements present at the 4 chromosome ends ( Table S1 ) . As a result , the telomeric probe set theoretically detects 98 . 4% ( 250/254 ) of the possible translocation-associated duplications resulting from Ty912-mediated nonreciprocal translocations targeting ectopic Ty-related elements in the S288C reference genome . Using this telomeric MLPA probe set , we first reanalyzed 5 isolates that were derived from the wild-type +Ty912 GCR assay strain and that were each previously identified by aCGH to contain a translocation chromosome associated with a chromosome arm duplication [12] . The MLPA results concurred with the previous aCGH results and , in each case , identified both the chromosome V-L deletion and the associated chromosome arm duplication identified previously ( Figure 1d ) . We next screened 112 newly isolated independent GCR-containing strains derived from the wild-type +Ty912 GCR assay strain . The MLPA data revealed that all ( 112 of 112 ) GCR-containing strains lost the left arm of chromosome V , and almost all ( 106 of 112 ) contained a duplicated region of another chromosome arm ( Table S2 ) . The remaining isolates either had no detectable duplication ( 5 of 112 ) or could not be unambiguously assigned to a rearrangement class ( 1 of 112 ) . We calculated a pair of expected distributions for the chromosome arm duplications based on the assumption that Ty912 could recombine with either all annotated ectopic Ty1 elements at equal frequency or all annotated ectopic Ty1 and delta elements ( in this analysis , each of the 13 Ty2 elements were included as 2 separate delta elements; see Methods ) at equal frequency ( Figure 2a , 2b ) . Analysis of the 106 observed duplicated chromosome arms isolated in the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain ( Figure 2c; Table S2 ) revealed numerous chromosome arm duplications that did not contain any annotated full length Ty1 sequences in the S288c reference sequence ( chrIII-L , chrIII-R , chrIX-L , chrXIII-L , chrXIV-R , chrXV-L , and chrXVI-L ) , indicating that , consistent with our previous results [12] , both ectopic Ty1 and delta elements are likely to have mediated the observed chromosome arm duplications . We found the distribution of observed chromosome arm duplications to be significantly different from a theoretical distribution that assumed that all Ty1 and delta elements acted as translocation targets ( Monte Carlo Sampling of a Multinomial Distribution; 2000 replicates; Empirical p = 5 . 00×10−4 ) . Several chromosome arm duplications were significantly overrepresented in the observed distribution compared to the theoretical distribution , including duplications of chrIII-R ( 28 times; exact binomial; p = 5×10−18 ) , chrV-R ( 27 times; exact binomial; p = 1×10−9 ) , chrXIV-L ( 8 times; exact binomial; p = 4×10−5 ) , and chrX-R ( 10 times; exact binomial; p = 2×10−3 ) . Together these 4 classes of chromosome arm duplications represented 69% ( 73 of 106 ) of the observed duplications . We next sought to identify if there was any bias in this analysis due to the orientation of Ty912 on chromosome V . We and others have previously shown that translocations targeting centromere-oriented Ty elements yield dicentric chromosomes that must undergo secondary rearrangements to eliminate a centromere [12] , [16] , [23] . Due to this requirement of secondary rearrangements , these events are likely to be under-represented relative to the proportion of recombinations involving telomere-oriented Ty elements . Thus , it is possible that inclusion of centromere-oriented Ty elements in the list of possible recombination targets biased our analysis . . To check for such bias , we compared the observed distribution of chromosome arm duplications to the distribution of potential telomere-oriented Ty1 and delta element translocation targets ( Figure S1 ) . The chrIII-R , chrV-R , chrXIV-L , and chrX-R duplications were still significantly over-represented when compared to this theoretical distribution ( exact binomials; p = 2×10−13 , 1×10−8 , 4×10−4 , and 1×10−2 , respectively ) . Thus , our MLPA analysis of a large number of GCRs isolated from a single genetic background confirmed the chromosome arm duplication bias we previously noted when we used aCGH to analyze a smaller number of GCR-containing strains isolated from 12 different wild-type and mutant strains [12] . In order to investigate the possibility that specific Ty-related elements were responsible for the observed chromosome arm duplication bias in the wild-type +Ty912 GCR assay , we created a series of MLPA probe sets specific for chrIII-R , chrV-R , chrX-R , and chrXIV-L . These probe sets contained one or two pairs of primers designed to hybridize between every pair of Ty1 , Ty2 , solo delta , centromeric , and telomeric element along each chromosome arm , except for a few cases of closely collocated Ty loci ( Figure 3a–3d; Tables S3 , S5 , S6 , S7 ) . We first used the chrIII-R MLPA probe set ( Figure 3a; Table S3 ) to analyze the 28 GCRs involving chromosome III right arm duplications . Two patterns of chromosome arm duplications were observed: those in which the chrIII-R probes telomeric , but not centromeric , to the YCRWdelta8-YCRWdelta9-YCRWdelta10 locus ( 61%; n = 17 ) were duplicated and those in which the chrIII-R probes telomeric , but not centromeric , to the YCRWdelta11 locus ( 39%; n = 11 ) were duplicated ( Figure 3a; Table 1 ) . These loci have been previously termed fragile site 1 ( FS1 ) and fragile site 2 ( FS2 ) and were originally identified as hotspots of Ty recombination under conditions of DNA replication stress caused by reduction of the levels of different replicative DNA polymerases [15] . FS1 was found to replace the SRD1 and YCRWdelta8-YCRWdelta9-YCRWdelta10 loci in the S288c annotated sequence with a pair of tandem full length Ty1s oriented in a direct repeat orientation . FS2 was found to contain two Ty1s oriented in an inverted head-head configuration with a 283 bp spacer sequence in between the two Ty1s instead of the single annotated YCRWdelta11 locus . Other studies have also confirmed that these loci show differences from the SGD S288c reference sequence [27] , [33] . We confirmed the presence of both the tandem direct repeat pair of full length Ty1s at FS1 and the pair of inverted repeat Ty1s at FS2 in our strains by PCR and sequencing . These results demonstrate that MLPA can be used to identify specific translocation fusion junctions and that FS1 and FS2 , even in the presence of normal rates of DNA replication , likely have fragile site activity that results in increased frequencies of Ty-mediated translocations . We next analyzed the GCR-containing strains associated with other overrepresented chromosome arm duplications ( chrV-R , XIV-L , and X-R ) using the remaining chromosome arm-specific MLPA probe sets ( Tables S5 , S6 , S7 ) . The MLPA data revealed the existence of Ty-mediated translocation hotspots on each of the chromosome arms ( Figure 3b–3d; Table 1 ) . The majority of duplications ( 18 of 27 ) of the right arm of chromosome V appeared to target the linked YERWdelta17 , YERWdelta21 , and YERCTy1-1 loci ( note that this region also contains an unannotated partial Ty sequence [12] ) , with a smaller proportion ( 5 of 27 ) of duplications targeting the region containing the linked YERCdelta14 , YERCdelta15 , and YERCdelta16 loci . This is in agreement with several studies that observed the involvement of the linked YERWdelta17 , YERWdelta21 , and YERCTy1-1 loci in Ty-mediated repair of DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) [9] , [26] , including our own prior observation of a translocation in which Ty912 of our assay targeted the centromere-oriented YERCTy1-1 on chrV-R and resulted in a dicentric translocation chromosome . This dicentric chromosome then underwent additional rounds of rearrangements to yield a monocentric translocation that had duplicated the telomeric end of chrV-R [12] . Likewise , 75% ( 6 of 8 ) of the chromosome arm duplications involving the left arm of chromosome XIV appeared to target YNLCTy2-1 . All of the duplications on the right arm of chromosome X ( 10 of 10 ) appeared to involve the YJRWTy1-1/YJRWTy1-2 tandem Ty1 locus . Overall , these results indicate that 63 . 2% ( 67 of 106 ) of the total Ty-mediated chromosome arm duplications identified in the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain could be accounted for by only 6 Ty target regions on 4 chromosome arms , which contrasts with the presence of 254 potential targets in the S . cerevisiae genome . One possible explanation for the observed Ty target bias is that Ty912 preferentially recombines with regions of high sequence homology . Although this explanation was at odds with the results for chromosome III ( Ty912 has 93% average sequence identity with Ty-related elements on chromosome III-L involved in 2 chromosome arm duplications and 77% average sequence identity with Ty-related elements on chromosome III-R involved in 28 chromosome arm duplications ) , overall sequence identity may not be the appropriate measure of homology that mediates recombination with Ty912 , as a previous study examining DSB-induced HR between Ty elements has noted [27] . We therefore investigated the possibility that translocations mediated by recombination between divergent homologous regions are suppressed by mismatch repair [11] , [34] , [35] . Thus , if sequence homologies drive the target distribution bias seen for Ty-mediated translocations , an msh2Δ mutation that eliminates suppression of homeologous recombination should alter the distribution of target Ty elements and chromosome arm duplications . An msh2Δ mutation resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in the rate of Ty912-mediated GCRs ( Table 2 ) . All 44 GCRs isolated in the msh2Δ mutant were associated with a chromosome V-L deletion and 43 of these GCRs were also associated with a chromosome arm duplication . In order to look for significant changes between the msh2Δ strain relative to the wild-type strain , we calculated the fold change between the observed duplication rate of each chromosome arm in the msh2Δ mutant relative to an expected duplication rate for each chromosome arm ( see Methods ) . The expected duplication rate assumed that the msh2Δ mutation evenly increased the duplication rates of all chromosome arms by the bulk-fold change between the msh2Δ mutant and wild-type GCR rates and hence the msh2Δ mutation was expected to increase the rate of each duplication 3-fold ( Table 2 ) ; in other words , we assumed the msh2Δ mutation did not preferentially affect the rate of any specific translocation ( see Methods ) . The duplication rates for each chromosome arm in the msh2Δ mutant were generally within the 95% confidence interval of the predicted msh2Δ rates and were approximately three-fold higher than the wild-type rates , consistent with the idea that the msh2Δ mutation increased both the average GCR rate and the translocation rate of each chromosome arm by 3-fold . The only exceptions were the duplication rates of chromosome arms II-R , XVI-R , and V-R . Chromosome arm II-R and XVI-R duplications were not previously seen among the 112 wild-type GCRs analyzed and occurred at about a five-fold higher rate in the msh2Δ mutant than predicted from the maximum wild-type rate calculated for these 2 sites . The duplication rate of chromosome V-R was approximately four-fold lower than predicted from the wild-type rate ( Figure 2c ) . The duplication rates of all three of these chromosome arms were outside the 95% confidence interval of their predicted duplication rates calculated from the measured msh2Δ bulk rate ( p&lt;0 . 05 ) . In addition , the number of chromosome V duplications observed in the msh2Δ mutant was significantly lower than that seen in the wild-type strain ( Fisher's Exact Test; p = 0 . 0122 ) . However , GCRs associated with duplicated chromosome arms containing the translocation hotspots ( chrIII-R , V-R , X-R , and XIV-L ) were seen in both the msh2Δ +Ty912 assay strain and the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain in roughly equal proportions ( 70% vs . 69% ) . These results indicate that while an MSH2-dependent function may both modestly affect the rate of specific translocations and be potentially important for the formation of translocations involving the chromosome V-R hotspot , mismatch repair is largely not responsible for the biased distribution of translocations in the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain . This supports the idea that the sequence homology relationships between Ty912 and the other Ty elements in the S . cerevisiae genome are unlikely to be the sole , or major , determinant of translocation target site selection . One possible reason for the fact that six hotspots comprise nearly 70% of the observed chromosome duplications is that the six hotspots lie in close physical proximity to Ty912 , as such physical proximity may determine the ease with which homologous sequences can be targeted by HR . Using previous data that mapped the 3-dimensional spatial relationship of all chromosomes in wild-type cells [36] , we analyzed whether any of the six observed hotspots as well as the 20+ kb regions containing each hotspot were in close proximity to the region of chromosome V where Ty912 was inserted . Analysis of the Chromosome Conformation Capture-on-Chip ( 4C ) data generated with HindIII indicated that 2 of the 6 hotspots showed limited association with Ty912 on the left arm of chromosome V , whereas analysis of the data generated with EcoRI indicated that none of the hotspots were located adjacent to chrV-L ( Table S4 ) . Thus , we found minimal to no interactions between the region surrounding Ty912 and the observed hotspot locations . Consequently , it is unlikely that physical proximity plays a large role in the selection of the most commonly used translocation targets . Most of the GCRs identified using the +Ty912 assay appear to result from RAD52-dependent Ty-mediated HR resulting in non-reciprocal translocations [12] . In S . cerevisiae , RAD52-dependent HR is primarily mediated by two pathways , which are dependent upon RAD51 and RAD59 , respectively [37] . Surprisingly , a rad51Δ single mutant had a significantly increased rate of Ty-mediated GCRs compared to wild type ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 4 . 89×10−7 ) , whereas a rad59Δ mutation decreased the GCR rate of the rad51Δ mutant strain to one equivalent to the GCR rate of the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 89 ) ( Table 2; Table S2 ) . The rad59 smutation had no significant effect on the Ty-mediated GCR rate of a wild-type strain ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 34 ) . Interestingly , our previous results indicate that the GCR rate of the rad51Δ rad59Δ +Ty912 assay strain was 53-fold higher that that seen for the rad51Δ rad59Δ −Ty912 assay strain , suggesting that Ty912-mediated GCRs occur at low rates in the rad51Δ rad59Δ mutant ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 2 . 09×10−6 ) [12] . To investigate how a rad51Δ mutation affected the formation of GCRs , we analyzed 46 GCR-containing isolates derived from a rad51Δ +Ty912 assay strain ( Table S2 ) . All 46 isolates contained a chromosome V-L deletion , and 42 of these isolates each contained a chromosome arm duplication ( Figure 4a ) . Four isolates did not have any accompanying chromosome arm duplications , which was a small , but statistically significant , increase compared to the bulk fold increase in the total GCR rate ( p&lt;0 . 05 ) . This suggests that a rad51Δ mutation results in a small increase in the rate of formation of broken chromosomes that are subsequently healed by de novo telomere addition [19] . There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of GCRs associated with chromosome III-R duplications arising from the rad51Δ mutant compared to a wild-type strain ( Fisher's exact test; p = 4 . 16×10−4 ) and , using the same method that was used to analyze the effect of an msh2Δ mutation on the rate of individual chromosome arm duplications , we found that the rate of chromosome III-R duplications was significantly decreased as well ( p&lt;0 . 05; Figure 4b ) . In contrast , the rates of the chromosome arm duplications involving the chromosome V-R , X-R , and XIV-L hotspots were not preferentially affected by the rad51Δ mutation . Additionally , chromosome IX-L and XII-R duplications were statistically significantly increased in the rad51Δ mutant compared to the relative bulk effect of a rad51Δ mutation . There were also statistically significant increases in the rates of duplication of several chromosome arms not originally observed among the 112 wild-type derived Ty912-mediated GCRs ( chromosomes II-R , VII-L , XI-L , XII-L , XIII-R , and XV-R ) ( Figure 4b; p&lt;0 . 05 ) . Overall , these results suggest that RAD51 is important for the formation of GCRs involving the hotspots on chromosome III-R and is important for the suppression of GCRs involving many other Ty-related translocation targets . To better understand the function of RAD59 in promoting GCRs in a rad51Δ mutant , we analyzed 30 Ty912-mediated GCRs obtained from a rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant ( Table S2 ) . We did not analyze a large number of GCRs isolated from a rad59Δ single mutant as a rad59Δ mutation did not significantly change the GCR rate in the +Ty912 assay ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 343 ) ( Table 2 ) . All 30 GCRs derived from the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant contained the chromosome V-L deletion and 29 of these GCRs were also associated with single chromosome arm duplications . Compared to the bulk fold increase in the GCR rate relative to the wild-type GCR rate , the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant had statistically significant decreases in the duplication rates of chromosomes III-R , IV-R , and XII-R , and an increase in the duplication rate of chromosome IX-L ( p&lt;0 . 05 ) . We also noted chromosome X-L ( n = 1 ) , chromosome XI-L ( n = 2 ) and chromosome XI-R ( n = 5 ) duplications , which were not seen in the wild-type chromosome arm distribution . The rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant had a lower overall GCR rate than the rad51Δ single mutant ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 1 . 13×10−5 ) ( Table 2 ) . Compared to the bulk affect of a rad59Δ mutation in a rad51Δ single mutant ( see Methods ) , the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant had decreased rates of duplication of chromosome arms IV-R and XII-R , as well as increased rates of duplication of chromosome arms XI-L and XI-R ( Figure 4c; p&lt;0 . 05 ) . In addition , the duplication rates of the chromosome arms associated with the chromosome III-R , V-R , X-R and XIV-L hotspots were reduced in the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant relative to the rad51Δ single mutant to the same extent as the bulk GCR rate ( Figure 4c , p&gt;0 . 05 ) . Overall , these results support the view that a RAD51-dependent HR pathway is important for suppressing Ty912-mediated translocations and that most of the translocations seen in the rad51Δ single mutant are promoted by RAD59-dependent HR . To verify that the duplicated chromosome arms associated with the GCRs formed in the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant were indeed fused to chromosome V , we analyzed 7 rad51Δ rad59Δ-derived GCRs using PFGE followed by Southern blotting with a probe specific to MCM3 , an essential gene on chromosome V . The results showed that all 7 GCRs ( I1–I7 ) were associated with abnormally large chromosome Vs , consistent with the duplicated chromosome arms being fused to deleted chromosome Vs ( Figure 4d ) , and reminiscent of previously investigated nonreciprocal translocations [12] . We did not verify the nature of the fusion junctions in these translocation chromosomes , although , as discussed below , we did verify the nature of several such translocation junctions identified in rad52Δ single and rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ triple mutants . There was a 5-fold decrease in the GCR rate of the rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain compared to that of the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 1 . 69×10−05 ) , consistent with the bulk of the Ty912-mediated GCRs being formed by HR ( Table 2 ) . The GCR rate of the rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain , however , was previously determined to be slightly , but not strictly significantly , higher than the GCR rate of the rad52Δ −Ty assay strain ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 0625 ) [12] , suggesting that Ty912-mediated GCRs may still occur at low rates in the rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain . To further investigate the role of RAD52 in the formation of Ty1-mediated GCRs , we used MLPA to analyze 50 independent GCRs derived from a rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain ( Table S2 ) . All 50 GCRs were associated with the chromosome V-L deletion . We did not detect any additional genome alterations in 34 ( 68% ) of these isolates , a finding consistent with a high rate of GCRs mediated by de novo telomere additions in a rad52Δ mutant [11] , [19] , [38] . In 16 ( 32% ) of the isolates , we observed additional chromosome arm duplications , with each isolate containing one chromosome arm duplication ( Figure 5a ) . This represented a significant decrease in the proportion of GCRs associated with chromosome arm duplications when compared those obtained from a wild-type strain ( Fisher's Exact test; p = &lt;2 . 2×10−16 ) . Interestingly , the rad52Δ mutant shared none of the significant chromosome arm duplication changes seen in the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant when these two mutant strains were compared with a rad51Δ single mutant , although this may be due to the small number of chromosome arm duplications analyzed in the case of the rad52Δ mutant ( Figure 4c ) . To confirm that the observed chromosome arm duplications seen in the rad52Δ mutant were associated with the formation of nonreciprocal translocations involving chromosome V-L and the duplicated chromosome arms , we further analyzed 7 rad52Δ-derived GCR-containing isolates , two of which ( I15 and I18 ) did not have chromosome arm duplications as determined by MLPA and five of which had single arm duplications ( I16 [chrIII-R] , I17 [chrIV-R] , I19 [chrX-R] , I20 [chrX-R] , and I21 [chrV-R] ) . Analysis of these isolates by PFGE followed by Southern blotting utilizing a probe to the chromosome V gene MCM3 revealed that each of the isolates without chromosome arm duplications contained a smaller than wild-type chromosome V ( consistent with the known chromosome V-L deletion associated with a de novo telomere addition ) and that the isolates with chromosome arm duplications each had a larger than wild-type chromosome V ( Figure 5b ) . No other chromosomes appeared to have altered lengths . Analysis of these same 7 GCR-containing strains by aCGH revealed that all 7 had a deletion of the left arm of chromosome V between TEL05L and Ty912 ( Figure S2 ) . Additionally , each of the 5 strains identified by MLPA to contain a chromosome arm duplication had an additional duplicated region of DNA bounded by a full length Ty1 or solo delta element at one end and a telomere at the other end ( Figure S2; Table S8 ) ; the amplified chromosome arms identified by MLPA were the same as those identified by aCGH . PCR amplification of the breakpoints of 3 of the GCRs ( I17 , I19 and I20 ) associated with chromosome arm duplications confirmed that these GCRs were the result of a fusion between chromosome V-L at Ty912 and the Ty or delta element bounding the duplicated region associated with each GCR ( Figure 5c; Table S8 ) ; the other 2 breakpoints could not be amplified . In addition , PCR amplification and sequencing of the breakpoints of four independent translocations ( I22–25 ) occurring in the rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain and identified by MLPA to be associated with a chromosome arm duplication similarly demonstrated the presence of translocation chromosomes that resulted from fusions between chromosome V-L at Ty912 and the Ty or delta elements bounding the duplicated region associated with each GCR ( Figure 5c; Table S8 ) . Thus , deletion of RAD52 decreases , but does not completely eliminate , HR that promotes Ty-mediated nonreciprocal translocations [19] , [38] . We next examined whether RAD51 and RAD59 , which encode homologous pairing proteins [37] , and the Rad1–Rad10 complex , which processes non-homologous single-stranded DNA tails that form during single-stranded annealing [39] , were required for the formation of Ty912-mediated translocations formed by RAD52–independent HR . To this end , we investigated to differing degrees the rate and structure of Ty912-mediated GCRs in rad52Δ and rad52Δ rad59Δ double mutants , the rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ triple mutant , and the rad52Δ double mutant . All four mutant strains had GCR rates that were statistically similar to the GCR rate of a rad52Δ single mutant ( Table 2 ) ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 21 , 0 . 10 , 0 . 95 and 0 . 79 , respectively ) and had statistically similar frequencies of GCRs containing and lacking chromosome arm duplications ( Fisher's Exact Test with Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing; all p values&gt;0 . 0167 ) ( Figure 6a; Figure S3; Table S2 ) [40] . The chromosome arm duplication patterns of the rad52Δ double and triple mutants were also highly similar to that of the rad52Δ single mutant ( Figure 6a; Figure S3 ) , unlike that of the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant ( see above ) . To confirm that the chromosome arm duplications seen in the rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ mutant were associated with the formation of nonreciprocal translocations involving chromosome V-L and the duplicated chromosome arms , we analyzed 7 GCRs isolated from this mutant by PFGE followed by a Southern blotting utilizing a probe to MCM3 . Four GCRs were shown by MLPA to be associated with single chromosome arm duplications ( I10 [chrIV-R] , I11 [chrX-R] , I12 [chr-XIIR] , I13 [chrXII-R] ) and three were not associated with a chromosome arm duplication ( I8 , I9 , I14 ) ( Figure 4d ) . The results revealed that the four GCRs associated with chromosome arm duplications ( I10 , I11 , I12 , I13 ) were each associated with an abnormally large chromosome V and the three GCRs that did not involve a chromosome arm duplication ( I8 , I9 , I14 ) were each associated with a smaller than wild-type chromosome V . The smaller than wild-type chromosome Vs were consistent with the formation of GCRs mediated by de novo telomere addition . No other chromosomes appeared to be altered in these 7 GCR-containing strains . PCR amplification of the breakpoints of 2 of the GCRs derived in the rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ +Ty912 assay strain ( I11 &amp; I12 ) confirmed the presence of translocation chromosomes that were the result of a fusion between chromosome V-L at Ty912 and the Ty1 element bounding the duplicated region associated with each GCR ( Figure 6b ) . Thus , deletion of RAD51 and RAD59 in a rad52Δ mutant does not completely eliminate HR that promotes Ty-mediated nonreciprocal translocations . We next investigated the potential role of two different pathways involving Rtt109 in suppressing GCRs and aneuploidy . Both Vps75 , a histone chaperone , and Asf1 , a nucleosome assembly factor , form separate complexes with Rtt109 that acetylate H3K56 in vitro , although only the Asf1-Rtt109 complex appears to be required for acetylation of H3K56 in vivo [47] . We found that a vps75Δ single mutant had essentially the same rate of Ty912-mediated GCRs as the wild-type strain , whereas an asf1Δ single mutant had an increased rate of Ty912-mediated GCRs similar to that seen for a rtt109Δ mutant ( Table 2 ) . Analysis of 45 vps75Δ and 55 asf1Δ derived GCR-containing isolates for whole chromosome duplications revealed no whole chromosome duplications among the vps75Δ-derived GCR-containing isolates and 7 instances of asf1Δ-derived GCR-containing isolates containing whole chromosome duplications ( Figure 7a; Table S2 ) . The frequency of whole chromosome duplications in the asf1Δ mutant was not significantly different from that of an rtt109Δ mutant ( Fisher's Exact test; p = 0 . 207 ) . Additionally , the distribution of chromosome arm duplications seen for the GCRs derived from the vps75Δ mutant ( 40/45 GCRs ) was strikingly similar to that seen with the wild-type strain , while the distribution of chromosome arm duplications seen for the GCRs derived from the asf1Δ mutant ( 50/55 GCRs ) more closely reflected that of the rtt109Δ mutant ( Figure 7b , 7c; Table S2 ) . RLF2 ( also known as CAC1 ) encodes a subunit of CAF-1 , a chromatin assembly complex that mediates nucleosome assembly in cooperation with ASF1 [48] . Consistent with this , an asf1Δ double mutant was previously demonstrated to have a synergistic increase in the rate of single copy sequence-mediated GCRs compared to both rlf2Δ and asf1Δ single mutants [49] . The rlf2Δ single mutant strain was similar to the wild-type strain and had only a small 2-fold increase in the Ty912-mediated GCR rate ( Table 2 ) . When we analyzed 46 rlf2Δ derived GCR-containing isolates by MLPA , we detected no whole chromosome duplications and a chromosome arm duplication pattern similar to that seen in the wild-type strain , except for increased rates of chromosome III-L , IX-L , XI-L , and XVI-R arm duplications ( Figure S4; Table S2 ) . Similarly , there was no significant increase in the frequency of whole chromosome duplications in an asf1Δ rlf2Δ double mutant compared to an asf1Δ single mutant ( Fisher's Exact test; p = 0 . 483 ) ( Figure 7a ) , even though the double mutant had a synergistic 120-fold increase in the GCR rate compared to the asf1Δ and rlf2Δ single mutants ( Table 2 ) . Moreover , 75% ( 9/12 ) of the chromosome arm duplications seen in the asf1Δ rlf2Δ mutant ( 29/30 GCRs ) were seen in an asf1Δ mutant , while the remaining 25% ( 3/12 ) chromosome arm duplications were observed in the profile of an rlf2Δ mutant . Thus , despite the synergistic increase in GCR rate observed in an asf1Δ rlf2Δ mutant , the distribution of chromosome arm duplications appeared to be additive , with the increase in aneuploidy likely a result of only the asf1Δ mutation . Taken together , these results suggest that the rtt109Δ-dependent increase in whole chromosome duplications is linked to defects in the ASF1-RTT109-dependent H3K56 acetylation pathway . To investigate whether aneuploidy results from the inability of the ASF1-RTT109 complex to acetylate histone H3K56 , we tested mutations that altered histone H3K56 for their effect on the accumulation of whole chromosome duplications . For this analysis , we constructed strains with chromosomal hht1-hhf1Δ hht2-hhf2Δ double deletions carrying plasmids encoding various unacetylatable mutant alleles of HHT2 and a wild-type copy of HHF2 . In this manner , we were able to construct hht1-hhf1Δ hht2-hhf2Δ HHF2 hht2::H3K56G and hht1-hhf1Δ hht2-hhf2Δ HHF2 hht2::H3K56R mutant strains . The strain containing the hht2::H3K56G mutation and the strain containing the hht2::H3K56R mutation both exhibited increased GCR rates that were slightly lower than that of an rtt109Δ mutant ( Table 2 ) . All ( 46/46 ) and 97 . 8% ( 44/45 ) of the GCR-containing isolates derived from the hht2::H3K56G mutant and hht2::H3K56R mutant , respectively , were associated with single chromosome arm duplications; there were 6 and 2 isolates of the hht2::H3K56G and hht2::H3K56R mutant strains , respectively , that had both a whole chromosome duplication as well as a GCR ( Figure 7a ) . The frequency of whole chromosome duplications in the hht2 mutants was either not significantly different ( hht2::H3K56G , Fisher's Exact test; p = 0 . 289 ) or slightly reduced ( hht2::H3K56R , Fisher's Exact test; p = 0 . 0155 ) compared to the rtt109Δ mutant . We further investigated the distribution of chromosome arm duplications for the GCRs derived from the hht2 mutant strains to the distribution seen for the wild-type strain . We focused on seven chromosome arm duplications ( chrIII-R , IV-R , V-R , VII-R , VIII-L , XII-R , and XVI-R ) that shared duplication differences in the rtt109Δ and asf1Δ single mutants when compared to the distribution observed for the wild-type strain ( Figure 7b; Table S2 ) . The profile seen for the hht2::H3K56G mutant shared 4 of the 7 changes ( Hypergeometric test; p = 0 . 0187 ) , while the profile seen for the hht2::H3K56R mutant shared 5 of the 7 changes ( Hypergeometric test; p = 7 . 72×10−6 ) , supporting the view that these two hht2 mutations are similar to the rtt109Δ and asf1Δ in regard to their effects on the suppression of GCRs . Overall , these results suggest that the loss of acetylation at histone H3K56 results in high rates of GCRs and whole chromosome duplications . \\n In this study , we adapted MLPA to identify chromosome arm duplications and deletions , as well as whole chromosome duplications , in order to provide insights into the processes that suppress and promote GCRs in S . cerevisiae . Compared to previous methods used to analyze GCRs [7] , [11] , [12] , [14] , [15] , [20]–[29] , this method is rapid , affordable , and of sufficiently high resolution to provide useful structural insights to guide subsequent analysis . We validated the utility of this method by investigating bias in target site selection of Ty1-mediated translocations , RAD52-independent Ty1-mediated translocations that appear to occur by HR , and whole chromosome duplications that occur at increased rates in an rtt109Δ mutant . This ability to generate structural information for a large numbers of GCRs allowed us to demonstrate the existence of a number of translocation target hotspots and demonstrate that these hotspots likely mediate translocations by different mechanisms . In addition , we obtained evidence for a RAD52-independent HR pathway that can promote Ty1-mediated translocations , as well as evidence for an association between whole chromosome duplications and GCRs in an rtt109Δ mutant . These results demonstrate that the methods developed here will facilitate future analysis of GCR structures in other mutant backgrounds , which will likely reveal yet other unanticipated aspects of the mechanisms that prevent GCRs . We previously observed that GCRs isolated in the presence of Ty912 located on a nonessential arm of chromosome V were almost exclusively associated with a loss of the region of chromosome V-L from the Ty912 to the left telomere and a duplication of a terminal region of another chromosome arm [12] . In nearly all cases , these GCRs were the products of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by HR between Ty912 on chromosome V-L and an ectopic Ty element on a target chromosome . Using MLPA probes hybridizing to the telomeric ends of the chromosomes , we identified four chromosome arms ( the right arm of chromosome III , the right arm of chromosome V , the left arm of chromosome XIV , and the right arm of chromosome X ) that were the target of approximately 70% of the translocations in a wild-type strain and thus appeared to contain hotspots for HR events resulting in Ty912-mediated translocations . Detailed analysis using MLPA probes specific to these chromosome arms demonstrated that there were only 6 hotspots that mediated these translocations versus at least 254 potential targets for Ty-mediated translocations in the S . cerevisiae genome , and that furthermore , these hotspots were composed of Ty elements . We considered a number of potential explanations to account for the existence of the observed translocation hotspots; however , no single factor could explain the observed translocation target distributions . First , sequence homology with Ty912 did not explain the hotspots , as the target Ty elements at the hotspots did not share the highest degree of homology with Ty912 . Additionally , the target site distribution was relatively unaffected by an msh2Δ mutation that increased the efficiency of homeologous recombination , suggesting that the hotspot distribution was not determined by sequence homology . Second , the location of essential genes likely played little or no role in generating the target site distribution . The region of the left arm of chromosome V that is deleted in the GCRs detected by the assay contains only non-essential genes , and all of the translocations detected were non-reciprocal translocations that only duplicated other regions of the genome . Hence , no essential gene was ever observed to be deleted or would be expected to be deleted in this assay . Third , the distribution of centromere- ( 52 . 4% of Ty elements ) vs . telomere- ( 47 . 6% of Ty elements ) oriented Ty elements does not explain the distribution of target hotspots as almost all of the chromosome arms contain centromere- and telomere-oriented Ty elements , and the hotspot usage observed was significantly different compared to the distribution of all Ty elements as well as the distribution of only telomere-oriented Ty elements . Furthermore , translocations mediated by centromere-oriented Ty elements , which result in intermediate dicentric translocation chromosomes , were recovered using our assay , and at least 1 of the 6 observed translocation hotspots has been previously demonstrated to mediate the formation of dicentric translocations that undergo additional rounds of rearrangements [12] . Finally , analysis of the data from 4C experiments [36] showed that the spatial proximity of the hotspot targets relative to Ty912 on the left arm of chromosome V was also unable to explain the hotspots . Thus , target selection seems likely to reflect structural features of either individual Ty elements that are the targets of Ty-mediated translocations , or structural features of the region of the genome in which they reside . The translocation hotspots on chromosome III-R were located at two previously identified fragile sites ( FS1 and FS2 ) that were induced by down-regulation of the replicative DNA polymerases [14] , [15] . Consistent with previous studies [15] , [27] , [33] , each of these fragile sites contains a pair of Tys that were targeted by Ty912-mediated translocations , with FS1 containing 2 tandemly repeated Ty1 sequences and FS2 containing a pair of inverted Ty1 sequences separated by a short spacer sequence . The fact that we identified these same two fragile sites using our assay that detects spontaneous rearrangements implies that these sites are also fragile under conditions of normal DNA replication . We previously suggested that Ty912-mediated translocations might occur by a mechanism in which a broken chromosome V was repaired by break-induced replication ( BIR ) in which the Ty912 on a broken chromosome V promotes strand invasion at the site of ectopic Ty elements and primes DNA synthesis , resulting in copying the terminal region of the target chromosome from the target Ty element to the telomere onto the end of the broken chromosome V [12] . However , the observation that FS1 and FS2 are hotspots for Ty912-mediated translocations suggests at least two other possible mechanisms: HR between two DSBs , one on chromosome III-R and one on chromosome V-L , or BIR initiated by a DSB at either FS1 or FS2 that then invades chromosome V at Ty912 and is followed by loss of the intact chromosome V left by BIR during the selection for the GCR . The fact that another Ty hotspot on chromosome X-R also appears to contain tandem Ty1 elements ( YJRWTy1-1 and YJRWTy1-2 ) ( Table 1 ) suggests that this site might also represent a fragile site , although other there are Ty1 loci in the genome that also contain tandem Ty1 sequences and these did not appear to be translocation target hotspots sites . The hotspot on chromosome XIV-L and the two hotspots on chromosome V-R , one of which has previously been observed as a target of Ty-mediated translocations [9] , [12] , [26] , are not annotated to contain tandem or inverted Ty elements and it is not clear what causes these sites to act as translocation hotspots . We previously observed that a large proportion of Ty912-mediated translocations were mediated by RAD52-dependent HR and we obtained genetic evidence that a RAD51–dependent HR pathway primarily suppressed Ty-mediated translocations in wild-type strains , whereas a RAD59–dependent HR pathway promoted Ty-mediated translocations in the absence of RAD51 . In agreement with this , we found that a rad51Δ mutation increased both the rate of accumulation and the diversity of chromosome arm duplications , and that a rad59Δ mutation decreased the rate of most of the individual types of GCRs that occurred in a rad51Δ mutant . Interestingly , in the rad51Δ mutant , several of the chromosome arms that were duplicated at increased rates did not have full-length Ty1 elements but only contained solo delta elements ( chrVII-L , chrIX-L , chrXI-L , and chrXII-L ) . As RAD59-dependent HR promotes SSA between short repeat sequences [50] this raises the possibility that some of the translocation targets that show increased targeting in the rad51Δ mutant may reflect increased rates of HR between short repeated sequences mediated by RAD59-mediated HR . The majority of the GCRs isolated from rad51Δ and rad59Δ single mutants and rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant strains were the result of nonreciprocal translocations between Ty912 and ectopic Tys like those seen in wild-type strains . A striking finding was the almost complete elimination of translocations mediated by the chromosome III-R hotspots in the rad51Δ mutant in contrast to the other GCRs , including those mediated by the other translocation hotspots whose rates were increased in the rad51Δ mutant and decreased in the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant . This suggests that structural features of the translocation targets affect the mechanism of translocation . For example , the chromosome III-R hotspot may be a particularly good substrate for BIR given that the translocations mediated by this hotspot were highly dependent on RAD51 , consistent with prior results [16] , [24] , [51] , whereas the other translocation targets might be more amenable to aberrant repair by RAD59-dependent single-stranded annealing ( SSA ) of broken chromosomes at the site of Ty elements [50] , [52] , [53] . The results described here also support the idea that Ty-mediated translocations can occur via a RAD52-independent HR pathway . Deletion of RAD52 reduced the rate of Ty-mediated GCRs significantly below the wild-type rate , although not completely to the level observed in a rad52Δ mutant in the absence of the Ty912 element . Consistent with this , a significant proportion of GCRs in a rad52Δ mutant with the Ty912 present appeared to result from de novo telomere addition after chromosome breakage . However , there was also a significant fraction of translocations mediated by HR between Ty912 and ectopic Ty elements in a rad52Δ mutant . These Ty-mediated translocations were the same types of translocations seen in wild-type strains . At first glance , our data suggest that the Ty912-mediated GCRs in a rad52Δ mutant might occur by the same type of RAD52-independent recombination seen for other repetitive elements , which is believed to involve SSA followed by half-crossover mechanism [54] , [55] . However , simultaneous deletion of both RAD51 and RAD59 , or deletion of RAD1 ( which can promote SSA by removal of nonhomologous DNA flaps [56] ) , in the rad52Δ mutant did not reduce the GCR rate further and resulted in distributions of GCRs that were similar to that seen in the rad52Δ single mutant . Furthermore , we demonstrated that several of the translocations seen in the rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ triple mutant were due to HR between Ty912 and ectopic Ty elements . This suggests that there might be other mechanisms for promoting recombination or that other nucleases besides Rad1–Rad10 can cleave off non-homologous tails that form during SSA [57] , [58] . Previous studies have observed occasional examples of strains containing GCRs and independent whole chromosome duplications [12] , [18] , [23] . In the present study , we used MLPA to detect whole chromosome duplications in large numbers of independent GCR-containing rtt109Δ-derived isolates . We found a statistically significant association of GCRs and whole chromosome duplications in these isolates . Because an rtt109Δ mutation caused an increase in the accumulation of whole chromosome duplications , but the presence of a whole chromosome duplication did not increase the GCR rate of an rtt109Δ mutant , and because the presence of GCRs did not increase the accumulation of whole chromosome duplications in an rtt109Δ mutant , it seems likely that in an rtt109Δ mutant , whole chromosome duplications tend to arise with GCRs . RTT109 encodes a histone H3 lysine 56 acetylase [41] , [42] and our analysis demonstrated that the suppression of GCRs and the suppression of whole chromosome duplications associated with GCRs was due to the role of the Rtt109-Asf1 complex in the acetylation of H3K56 . The mechanism by which acetylation of H3K56 suppresses GCRs and aneuploidy is currently unclear; however , the observation that rtt109Δ mutants have defects in recovery from DNA damage induced checkpoint activation [43] , [44] , [59] , but are not DNA repair defective per se , suggests aberrant recovery from arrest due to the DNA damage that results in GCRs might also result in mis-segregation of chromosomes during mitosis . \\n General methods have been previously described [7] , [11] , [12] , [60] . Genomic DNA preparations were quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer ( Invitrogen ) . All strains used in this study were derivatives of S288c and are described in Table S12 . Plasmids pFX04 and pFX06 [61] were used to create hht2::H3K56G HHF2 and hht2:H3K56R HHF2 strains . Ty1 fusion junctions were amplified with Velocity DNA Polymerase ( Bioline ) using the following protocol: 2 min 98°C initial denaturation step; 25 cycles of 12 sec 98°C denaturation , 30 sec 63 . 8°C annealing , 3 min 30 sec 72°C extension; final 4 min 72°C extension . Primer design followed the recommendations for synthetic-probes available on the MRC-Holland website ( http://www . mrc-holland . com ) , with the exception that the minimum length differences between amplification products was designed to be 2 base pairs . All primers were purchased and synthesized by ValueGene ( http://www . valuegene . com ) . We designed a total of six sets of primers . Two primer sets were designed to detect copy number variation of different chromosome arms . The set of 32 telomeric probe pairs ( Table S1; Figure 1b ) was designed to hybridize to unique sequence located between chromosome telomeres and the most distal Ty1 or solo delta elements; four probes ( corresponding to the left arm of chromosome II , the right arm of chromosome IV , the right arm of chromosome IX , and the left arm of chromosome XV ) were designed to hybridize centromeric to the most distal Ty1 or solo delta elements due to the lack of suitable unique sequence in the preferred region . The set of 32 centromeric probe pairs ( Table S9; Figure 1b ) was designed to hybridize to unique sequence located centromeric to the Ty1 or solo delta elements closest to the centromere of each chromosome arm . Ty2 elements were represented in this analysis as two independent solo delta elements per Ty2 element as these delta elements contain the majority of the homology between Ty2 and Ty1 elements . We also designed four primer sets capable of pinpointing duplications along whole chromosome arms for chromosomes III-R , V-R , X-R , and XIV-L ( Tables S3 , S5 , S6 , S7 , respectively ) . These primer sets generally contained pairs of probes that hybridized immediately telomeric and centromeric to each Ty1 and solo delta element on the pertinent chromosome arm ( Figure 3a–3d ) . All amplification reagents were purchased from MRC-Holland ( http://www . mrc-holland . com ) . The MLPA reaction has been previously described for human genomic DNA [32] . Briefly , probes are hybridized to chromosomal DNA , ligated , and amplified by PCR using universal priming sequences ( Figure 1c ) . Modifications for analysis of S . cerevisiae genomic DNA were as follows: 5 ng of template genomic DNA was used instead of 50–100 ng; a 10 min initial 98°C denaturation step was used instead of 5 min; 23 ( for chromosome arm specific probe sets ) or 25 ( for telomeric or centromeric probe sets ) PCR cycles were used instead of 35 cycles; and , importantly , the use of thin walled PCR tube strips and plates . Fragment separation was carried out as suggested by MRC-Holland on an ABI 3730XL sequencer using POP7 polymer and GS500-LIZ sizing standard ( ABI ) . 8 . 95 µl of Hi-Di Formamide ( ABI ) and 0 . 05 µl of GS500-LIZ sizing standard were mixed with 1 µl of the MLPA PCR product per isolate for a total volume of 10 µl . Then an 82°C heat denaturation step was performed for 2 minutes followed by an incubation step at 4°C for 5 minutes before analysis on the ABI3730XL sequencer instead of the suggested 80°C/4°C steps . Raw peak data for each run was obtained via the GeneMapper software from ABI . Data analysis was performed using Python ( version&gt; = 2 . 5 ) and as described by MRC-Holland ( http://www . mrc-holland . com ) . The observed rate of the duplication of each chromosomal arm for a strain was taken to be the total CanR 5FOAR rate of the strain multiplied by the fraction of GCRs associated with the duplication of that chromosomal arm . The expected rate of a test strain relative to a control strain was calculated by multiplying the observed duplication rate for each chromosome arm in the control strain by a scaling constant . The scaling constant was the sum of the rates of the duplications of all chromosome arms in the test strain divided by the sum of the rates of the duplications of all chromosome arms in the control strain . This scaling constant was very similar to the ratio of CanR 5FOAR rates of the test and control strains for those strains dominated by GCRs associated with chromosome arm duplications , but properly handles mutations like rad52Δ which results in a substantial fraction of GCRs lacking chromosome arm duplications . In cases where no duplications for an individual chromosome arm were found in the control strain , then the expected rate was estimated as the upper limit of the duplication rate of that chromosomal arm ( the total CanR 5FOAR rate divided by the number of duplications ) . In cases where no chromosome arm duplication was found in the test strain , then the upper limit of the rate was used if it was less than the expected rate , otherwise the ratio of observed vs . expected rates was set to 1 . In cases where no duplications for an individual chromosome arm were found in both the test and control strain , then the ratio of observed vs . expected rates was set to 1 . R ( version≥2 . 11 . 1 ) was used to calculate p-values for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests , Fisher exact tests , the Monte Carlo sampling of multinomial distributions , the Hypergeometric test and the Binomial calculation . Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the median GCR rates were calculated using a two-sided nonparametric test ( http://www . math . unb . ca/~knight/utility/MedInt95 . htm ) . Individual chromosome arm duplication rates were considered to be statistically significantly different from the bulk rate of a mutant if the calculated individual chromosome arm duplication rates fell outside the transformed 95% confidence interval of the bulk fold rate of the mutant strain .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangements ( GCRs ) can lead to genetic diseases and the development of cancer . We previously demonstrated that introduction of the repetitive retrotransposon Ty912 onto a nonessential chromosome arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to increased genome instability predominantly due to increased rates of formation of monocentric nonreciprocal translocations . In this study , we adapted Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ) to analyze a large numbers of these GCRs . Using MLPA , we found that the distribution of translocations induced by the presence of Ty912 in a wild-type strain was nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes , even though there were 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S . cerevisiae genome . While the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination , we observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements . The formation of these RAD52-independent translocations did not require the Rad51 or Rad59 homologous pairing proteins or the Rad1–Rad10 endonuclease complex that processes branched DNAs during recombination . Finally , we found that defects in ASF1-RTT109–dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 ( H3K56 ) resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications , and resulted in aneuploidy that tended to occur simultaneously with GCRs . Overall , we found that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Protein–protein interactions play a central role in various aspects of the structural and functional organization of the cell , and their elucidation is crucial for a better understanding of processes such as metabolic control , signal transduction , and gene regulation . Genomewide proteomics studies , primarily yeast two-hybrid assays , will provide an increasing list of interacting proteins , but only a small fraction of the potential complexes will be amenable to direct experimental analysis . Thus , it is important to develop computational docking methods that can elucidate the details of specific interactions at the atomic level . Protein–protein docking generally starts with a rigid body search that generates a large number of docked conformations with good shape , electrostatic , and chemical complementarity . The conformations are clustered to obtain a manageable number of models , but the current methods are unable to select the most likely structure among these models . Here we describe a refinement algorithm that , applied to the individual clusters , improves the quality of the models . The better models are suitable for higher-accuracy energy calculation , thereby increasing the chances that near-native structures can be identified , and thus the refinement increases the reliability of the entire docking algorithm .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Similarly to protein folding , the association of two proteins is driven by a free energy funnel , determined by favorable interactions in some neighborhood of the native state . We describe a docking method based on stochastic global minimization of funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions ( SE ( 3 ) ) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains . The method , called semi-definite programming-based underestimation ( SDU ) , employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling . While SDU effectively minimizes functions with funnel-shaped basins , its application to docking in the rotational and translational space SE ( 3 ) is not straightforward due to the geometry of that space . We introduce a strategy that uses separate independent variables for side-chain optimization , center-to-center distance of the two proteins , and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules . The removal of the center-to-center distance turns out to vastly improve the efficiency of the search , because the five-dimensional space now exhibits a well-behaved energy surface suitable for underestimation . This algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima and shows similarity to the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions . Results for standard protein docking benchmarks establish that in this space the free energy landscape is a funnel in a reasonably broad neighborhood of the native state and that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation while achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods . \\n A minimization approach which is specific to funnel-like functions can be based on the concept of underestimation . The existence of a funnel implies that the free energy can be locally underestimated by a convex function ( Figure 1 ) . The original free energy function is extremely rugged with a huge number of local minima even in a small region of conformational space . Yet its convex underestimator is much smoother and still captures the overall funnel-like landscape , which provides a handle to free energy minimization . The quality of minimization through underestimation depends on the choice of underestimator functions , the way they are constructed and utilized to locate the global minimum , as well as how structured the free energy funnels are in conformational space . The Convex Global Underestimation ( CGU ) method [26] employed canonical quadratic functions as underestimators without any cross-terms . In that case the underestimator , based on a set of local minima , can be constructed by solving a Linear Programming ( LP ) problem . Uniformly distributed samples in the neighborhood of the underestimator's global minimum were then used to bias further sampling . The process was iterated with the set of local minima being updated , and the search region being reduced until certain convergence criteria are satisfied . CGU has been a very promising method with various applications in molecular structure prediction , including protein folding [27] and docking small molecules to proteins [28] . However , its restriction of using canonical quadratic functions limits its success in some cases [29] , since the principal axes of the free energy surface are not necessarily aligned with the canonical coordinates . The performance further deteriorates as the dimensionality of the search space increases . We have used theoretical analysis to show and simple test problems to demonstrate that this restriction can lead to incorrect convergence [30] . Motivated by the potential advantages of underestimation and practical shortcomings of the CGU algorithm , we have recently extended the method using general quadratic underestimators and introduced biased sampling guided by the underestimator [30] , [31] . Since the tightest underestimator in this class is obtained by solving a semi-definite programming problem , the method is termed SDU ( Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation ) . Semi-definite programming is computationally more demanding than the linear programming ( still solvable in polynomial-time though ) used in the CGU method . However , SDU typically requires fewer iterations and substantially improves optimization performance . The SDU method starts from a set of K local minima x1 , … , xK of a funnel-like function f ( x ) : within a given region of the search space . Throughout the course of the algorithm we maintain a set of local minima in the search region; initially . To capture the global funnel-like structure of f ( x ) within we construct a smooth ( convex ) quadratic function U ( x ) = x′Qx+b′x+c , where Q is a positive semi-definite matrix , , c is a scalar , and prime denotes transpose , such that U ( x ) underestimates f ( x ) at all local minima in , i . e . , U ( xi ) ≤f ( xi ) for all i = {1 , 2 , … , K} . The tightest possible underestimator ( with an L1 norm metric ) can be found by solving a semi-definite programming problem [30] . U ( x ) is a general convex quadratic function . The underestimator U is used to guide further sampling . The minimum of U , denoted by xP and referred to as the predictive conformation , is in an energetically favorable region , and hence a new conformation can be generated by local minimization starting from xP . Additional conformations are obtained by local minimization with randomly generated starting points such that points in the vicinity of xP have a higher probability of being selected than points further away . To that end , we simply sample within using a density function shaped as −U . The set is being updated by adding these newly obtained conformations while removing unfavorable ( i . e . , higher energy ) conformations , and the search area is being reduced to a neighborhood of xP . Using the updated conformations in we repeat the underestimation step and the whole process is being iterated until a convergence criterion is met . The SDU algorithm has a number of favorable properties when applied to funnel-shaped functions . Theoretical analysis shows [30] that xP converges in probability to the global minimum x* of the funnel-like function f as the number of samples K grows . When applied to test functions resembling the funnel-like free energy functions , SDU has been shown outperforming CGU and a simulated annealing algorithm which adaptively tunes its parameters , with much less required function evaluations and much higher success rates [30] . The main goal of this paper is to develop and test docking methods that use the SDU algorithm in order to find the global minimum of a funnel-like function approximating the free energy over regions of the conformational space . Over the last few years we have developed a multistage docking method that starts with rigid body search based on Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) , selects and clusters 1000 to 2000 low energy docked structures , and retains the 10 to 30 largest clusters for further processing [32] . The conformational space is decomposed into separate regions defined by the clusters , where free energy attraction basins are believed to exist and the free energy landscape is assumed to be funnel-like . Then SDU is called upon to locate the global minimum within each region , by utilizing such funnel-like behavior . As will be shown , in spite of the success of SDU as an optimizer for functions with funnel-shaped basins , its application to docking turned out to be far from straightforward . Although the method yields meaningful moves in either translational or rotational subspaces [30] , minimization in the full 6D space of rigid body motions poses a challenge . This difficulty is well known in the robotics literature [33] . The Euclidean group SE ( 3 ) , which is the semidirect product of ( translations ) and the special orthogonal Euclidean group SO ( 3 ) ( rotations ) , is a nonlinear manifold and its parametrization is critical to any optimization procedure [33] . In particular , we will show that the funnel-like shape of the free energy surface is affected by the parameterization of the search space , and that underestimation tends to fail unless appropriate parameters are selected . We will describe two implementations of the SDU method: ( i ) SDU1 , a cyclic coordinate descent strategy where rotational and translational moves alternate; and ( ii ) SDU2 , a 5D strategy in which the distance of the two proteins is separately optimized and the SDU-driven search is performed in a lower dimensional space defined by 5 angular coordinates . Since the most energetically favorable distances occur when the two proteins are in contact but do not overlap , this strategy explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes [15] . Results will show that the methods discover broad energy funnels , generate high quality docking predictions , and produce a substantial efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods . The comparison with Monte Carlo methods is based on our earlier preliminary work [34] where we have tested a method similar to SDU1 against a 10-protein set using reduced Gō-type potentials . Even with these relatively smooth potentials , underestimation in the full 6D space has not been effective , and we had to rely on optimizing in each ( rotational or translational ) subspace separately . In the present paper , we show that the SDU1 strategy is effective against a larger benchmark set using much more refined energy potentials . However , our main contribution is the introduction of SDU2 which is more effective and improves efficiency by a factor of 10 compared to SDU1 . In addition , SDU2 provides interesting biophysical insights with its resemblance to docking by repeated micro-collisions . \\n To define the docking problem we fix the position and orientation of the first ( receptor ) protein . The six-dimensional vector x specifies the position and orientation of the second ( ligand ) protein . The variables s account for the side chain conformations in both proteins , and ΔG ( x , s ) denotes the free energy function . The minimization of ΔG ( x , s ) with respect to s is restricted to the side chains in the interface and is carried out by local methods . We define ΔG* ( x ) = ΔG ( x , s* ) , where s* is an optimal solution; then the protein docking problem is finding the lowest minimum of ΔG* ( x ) in the region defined by the cluster , where x belongs to the space of rigid body motions , i . e . , the Euclidean group SE ( 3 ) . As described before , the parameterization of SE ( 3 ) is critical for optimization purposes , and hence we first describe our results concerning the parameterization of the search space . The space SE ( 3 ) is the semidirect product of ( translations ) and SO ( 3 ) ( rotations ) . The rotation group SO ( 3 ) is a 3-dimensional Lie group consisting of rotation matrices , i . e , , RR′ = I , det ( R ) = 1 . The Lie algebra of SO ( 3 ) , denoted by so ( 3 ) , may be represented by the real skew-symmetric matriceswhere . It is well-known that the one-parameter subgroups of SO ( 3 ) , i . e . , are geodesics [33] , [35] , [36] , i . e . , the shortest paths between two points on SO ( 3 ) . Moreover , for R0 , R1∈SO ( 3 ) , Ω = log ( R0′R1 ) ∈so ( 3 ) and the distance between R0 and R1 can be defined by ρ ( R0 , R1 ) = ∥log ( R0′R1 ) ∥ = ∥ω1−ω0∥ . This distance is a natural Riemannian metric on SO ( 3 ) , i . e . , it is bi-invariant with respect to the actions of the group ( rotations ) . The exponential map from so ( 3 ) to SO ( 3 ) defined by Ω → R0eΩ is a local diffeomorphism , i . e . , there exist an open neighborhood of 0∈so ( 3 ) and an open neighborhood of R0∈SO ( 3 ) and an invertible , surjective , and smooth map from one neighborhood to the other whose inverse is also smooth . The local diffeomorphism induces a coordinate chart in a neighborhood of R0 that is known as exponential coordinate system . Given the definition of so ( 3 ) this coordinate system can be parameterized by . Given the favorable properties of SO ( 3 ) ( more generally SO ( n ) ) such as the existence of a natural bi-invariant metric and , in particular , the simplicity of determining the geodesics of the manifold , the standard gradient based optimization algorithms on can be generalized for optimization on SO ( n ) [35] . However , generalization to the entire SE ( 3 ) is more difficult [33] , [36] . Although SE ( 3 ) is also Lie group , its one-parameter subgroups are no longer geodesics . Moreover , SE ( 3 ) does not admit a natural ( bi-invariant ) Riemannian metric while its subspaces SO ( 3 ) and do [33] , [36] . Attempting to implement SDU to SE ( 3 ) by simultaneous translational and rotational optimization , we have generally failed to construct useful underestimators . We have , however , found two strategies that were able to overcome this problem . The SDU1 and SDU2 algorithms were tested on the protein pairs given in protein docking benchmark sets [38] , [39] that contain enzyme–inhibitor , antigen–antibody , and “other” types of complexes , using the independently determined ( unbound ) structures of the component proteins . The algorithms were used to refine the top ( most populated ) clusters of docked structures generated by the rigid body docking program PIPER [22] . We consider the 10 largest clusters for enzyme–inhibitor complexes , and 30 clusters for antigen–antibody and “other” complexes . Table 1 shows results both from the rigid body docking and the SDU-based refinement procedures for all three types of complexes , each defined by its Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) code [5] in Column 1 of Table 1 . We emphasize that for most complexes we docked the unbound ( separately crystallized ) protein structures rather than their bound conformations obtained by separating the complex . The exceptions are mostly a few antigen–antibody complexes for which no separate antibody structures were available and hence were taken from the complex . However , even in these cases we used the separately crystallized structure of the antigen as given in the benchmark sets [38] , [39] . PDB codes for these “semi-bound” complexes are shown in bold italic fonts in Table 1 . Columns 2–4 of Table 1 describe the docked complex structures generated by the rigid body docking [22] before any refinement . As described in the Methods , the PIPER docking program evaluates the energy for billions of docked conformations . We retain the 1000 best scoring structures , and cluster them using the pairwise RMSD as the distance measure and an optimally selected clustering radius . We have observed that the near-native structures tend to be in one of the largest clusters , and hence rank the clusters on the basis of their size . In fact , calculated for the rigid protein structures , the energy function is approximate , and better discrimination of the native structures can be achieved by focusing on the large clusters . The properties shown in Table 1 are the number of near-native conformations ( or “hits” with less than 10 Å ligand interface Cα RMSD ) among the 1000 best scoring structures retained from the PIPER results , the Root Mean Square deviation ( RMSD ) between the native ligand structure and the docked structure at the center of the first cluster that includes a near-native conformation , and the rank of the particular cluster based on cluster size . Results are fairly good for enzyme–inhibitor complexes , as the 1000 structures , on the average , include over 200 hits , and the average RMSD is less than 5 Å between the native structure and the center of one of the three largest clusters . Although PIPER yields almost 200 hits for the “other” types of complexes , discrimination by cluster size is more difficult , and retaining the top 6 clusters results in 6 . 16 Å average RMSD . For antibody-antigen complexes PIPER generates much fewer hits , and on the average we have to retain 15 clusters to have a near-native structure in them . The next 6 columns in Table 1 show the results for the SDU1 and SDU2 algorithms , in each case listing the RMSD for the lowest energy conformation in the first cluster that includes a near-native structure , the rank of the cluster , and the average number n̅ of function evaluations . It is important to note that after the SDU refinement the clusters are ranked based on the energies of the SDU solutions rather than on cluster size . For comparison we also generated 2000 conformations ( based on the original protocol ) for each complex using version 2 . 3 of the rigid body docking program ZDOCK [21] , and refined the structures using RDOCK [40] , which performs local energy minimization . The last two columns of Table 1 show the RMSD of the first near-native structure found and its rank based on the RDOCK energy function . For enzyme–inhibitor complexes both SDU1 and SDU2 give excellent results . On the average , the RMSD is reduced by almost 1 Å and the average rank is around 2 . As the overall performance measure of the refinement we consider the number of complexes that have at least one prediction with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα RMSD from the native structure in the top 5 clusters . Such predictions would be termed “5 Å models” later for simplicity . As noted , the clusters of PIPER-generated structures are ranked based on their size ( i . e . , the number of structures ) . However , after the refinement the clusters are ranked based on the energy of their lowest energy structures . Among the PIPER-generated structures the top 5 clusters include less than 5 Å ligand interface RMSD predictions for only 11 of the 25 enzyme–inhibitor complexes . As shown in Table 1 , both SDU1 and SDU2 increase this number to 17 , i . e . , a more than 50% improvement relative to the PIPER results . Notice that the 5 lowest energy predictions obtained by the ZDOCK/RDOCK procedure include 5 Å models only for 7 complexes . However , from the ZDOCK/RDOCK runs we retain low energy models , whereas the results provided by SDU1 and SDU2 are low energy clusters , and ranking clusters rather than individual structures generally removes some false positives , i . e . , conformations that have low energy but are far from the native . It is well known that antigen–antibody and “other” complexes are more difficult to predict than enzyme–inhibitor complexes [20] . For antibody-antigen pairs only the refinement by SDU2 improves the PIPER results . Although both the RMSD and the average rank of the first near-native cluster are reduced , at 12 . 7 the latter remains high ( Table 1 ) . Similarly , for the complexes in the “other” category only SDU2 improves both the RMSD and the rank . Even SDU2 yields only a total of seven 5 Å models in the top five clusters for antibody–antigen and “other” types of complexes . This result is somewhat disappointing , but note that docking by ZDOCK and refining by RDOCK leads to 5 Å models only for three complexes , and no near-native solution is found in four cases . Figure 2 shows the RMSD vs . calculated free energy for the 25 enzyme–inhibitor complexes . Again we show PDB codes for the “semi-bound” complexes in bold italic fonts . Each point represents a structure sampled in the process of refining the 10 largest clusters using the SDU2 algorithm . The encircled blue asterisk indicates the native structure and the first hit is shown as a red square . In spite of the one-dimensional representation of the energy function defined in the 6D rotational and translational space , the figure demonstrates the multi-funnel behavior over a relatively broad region ( within 20 Å RMSD ) of the native state . For most complexes the figure shows a well defined deep funnel within 5 Å RMSD from the native structure . According to Table 1 , for 12 of the 25 complexes ( including 5 “semi-bound” cases ) , this funnel is deepest among the 10 clusters sampled . For example , for 4HTC the near-native cluster is the 7th largest , but it is energetically the most favorable after refinement . For the remaining 13 complexes , clusters farther from the native structure yield the deepest funnels , resulting in false positive predictions . One of the worst behaviors can be observed for 2PTC with the first near-native cluster ranked 4 , and Figure 2 shows a number of deep non-native funnels . However , on the average , one of the 3 deepest funnels is near-native ( Table 1 ) . This also shows the power of heuristic combination of entropic and enthalpic measurement , i . e . , cluster size as a filter and refined cluster depth as ranking parameter . Figure 3 shows the RMSD vs . calculated free energy for the antigen–antibody and “other” complexes , sampled in the refinement of the 30 largest clusters by SDU2 . All but 1SPB and 2BTF have multiple funnels , and the funnels are further from the native state than for enzyme–inhibitor pairs , demonstrating the well-known difficulty of estimating free energy using simple models , particularly for antigen–antibody complexes . Adjusting the conformation of interface side chains only by local minimization and keeping the backbone rigid also limits the accuracy of free energy calculation . As shown in Table 1 , the SDU2 strategy is much more efficient than SDU1 , and also provides substantially better results for the more difficult problem of docking antigen–antibody and “other” complexes . These differences are demonstrated in Figure 4A and 4B that show , for the near-native cluster of the complex 4HTC , the conformations sampled and minimized by each algorithm . The horizontal and vertical axes , respectively , represent translational and rotational distances between each sampled ligand conformation and the one in the native structure , the latter placed at the origin of this coordinate system . The rotational distance here is defined as the length of the minimum geodesic ( i . e . , the minimum rotation in radian ) between two rotations [36] . As discussed earlier , this distance between R0 and R1 can be defined by ρ ( R0 , R1 ) = ∥log ( R0′R1 ) ∥ = ∥ω1−ω0∥ . The points are color-coded according to their energies , from low ( blue ) to high ( red ) energy structures . As shown in Figure 4A , the separate treatment of translational and rotational subspaces in the SDU1 algorithm is highly inefficient , resulting in the sampling of many conformations with relatively high energies . Although all energy values shown are obtained by local minimization , the latter is unable to reduce the energy if the two proteins are too far from each other , which frequently occurs with the SDU1 algorithm . In addition , as indicated by the parallel lines , very similar translational regions are re-sampled at slightly different rotational coordinates , and vice versa . In contrast , as shown in Figure 4B , the SDU2 algorithm smoothly and efficiently descends toward the bottom of the free energy funnel . Based on the ranges of sampled free energy values , SDU2 sampled much lower energy regions compared to SDU1 . Since the search is restricted to biophysically meaningful encounter complexes , the more consistent energy values facilitate the construction of better underestimators during the search . According to Figure 4B , for SDU2 there is a clear trend that structures closer to the native complex generally have lower energies , resulting in a deep and broad free energy funnel in this space . The existence of such free energy funnels is much less obvious , even in each separate subspace , when sampled by the SDU1 algorithm ( Figure 4A ) . In test docking problems even the slower SDU1 algorithm outperformed a standard Monte Carlo method by reducing the number of function evaluations by a factor of two [34] . As shown in Table 1 , SDU2 further reduces the computational costs by a factor of 11 to 15 , depending on the type of complex . Since most of the computational time is spent in energy evaluations , the computational gain of SDU2 over SDU1 is more than a factor of 10 , and we estimate that SDU2 achieves more than 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods . We tested our algorithms on a 128-node biowulf cluster ( IBM eServer×Series ) . Each node contains dual 1 GHz PIII processors with 2 GB memory . A typical refinement by SDU2 for each PIPER-generated cluster would take 2 to 6 processor-hours . The running time varies with the protein complex size ( especially the interface size ) and the number of iterations before convergence . Notice that on the average SDU2 samples only about 100 encounter structures for each cluster . No particular efforts have been made to accelerate either the interface side-chain search or the line search to determine the center-to-center distance . The CPU times can be compared to those reported for a server [41] based on the RosettaDock algorithm [42] . The server performs 1000 independent Monte Carlo simulations within 30 Å Cα RMSD of a starting structure , as described in the RosettaDock protocol [42] . A typical run requires about 65 processor-hours . SDU based docking algorithms are stochastic in nature . Although we gave a theoretical guarantee of probabilistic convergence to the global minimum of funnel-like functions under some fairly general conditions [30] , practical protein docking problems do not necessarily satisfy all these conditions . To check the variations in our results we have repeatedly run SDU2 to refine the near-native cluster from PIPER ( columns 3 and 4 in Table 1 ) for 10 randomly selected complexes , including 4 enzyme–inhibitor , 4 antigen–antibody and 2 “other” complexes . SDU2 was run 10 times independently for each complex with the same set of parameters . The results ( ligand interface Cα RMSD versus corresponding free energy values ) are shown in Figure 5 , where black circles represent the rigid body predictions from PIPER before refinement and blue asterisks represent the independent SDU2 predictions . Some of the latter overlap , resulting in less than 10 distinct solutions . SDU2 is able to lower the free energy values in all cases and to improve RMSD in most of them . Table 2 shows the mean ( indicated by overline ) and the standard deviation ( indicated by σ ) for both the ligand interface RMSD and the free energy for each complex . Although the average standard deviation is relatively large ( about 4 . 4 Kcal/mol ) for free energies , it is less than 0 . 5 Å for RMSDs . This result indicates a good level of robustness , considering that our free energy model does not discriminate among structures within 1 Å RMSD from each other . Note that the SDU-based algorithms rely more on the collective distribution of a set of encounter structures in the free energy funnel , rather than on a single low energy structure , which reduces the sensitivity of the results to the variations in the starting structures . The successful application of the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation ( SDU ) search algorithm to protein–protein docking further validates the assumption that the free energy landscape of the complex is a funnel in some neighborhood of the native state . However , the direct application of SDU in the space SE ( 3 ) of rotations and translations fails to yield useful underestimators . Alternating searches in rotational and translational subspaces yields a feasible but inefficient algorithm . We have substantially improved performance by separately optimizing the center-to-center distance and describing SE ( 3 ) in terms of five angles . It is potentially important that this strategy samples encounter complexes , and hence it is reminiscent of the model of molecular association through a series of micro-collisions [37] . Results emphasize that the funnel-like shape of the free energy surface seen in this parameterization of SE ( 3 ) is largely lost when changing to the straightforward description of the space in terms of rotational and translational coordinates . The underestimation approach has been used in the latest rounds of CAPRI with considerable success [19] , [43] , and it provides a promising platform for improving docking methods . We note that Marcia et al . [44] recently reported the application of SDU to the docking problem using the general quadratic underestimation method we have earlier developed [30] , [31] . However , the central problem of parameterizing the search space was not discussed and the method was applied only to five bound docking problems using co-crystallized structures , which is much easier than docking two separately crystallized proteins . In fact , we believe that the separate minimization along the center-to-center vector and the use of five angular descriptors can improve the performance of any minimization algorithm used for docking . \\n The SDU1 and SDU2 algorithms were tested on complexes from the protein docking benchmark sets [38] , [39] . These sets contain enzyme–inhibitor , antigen–antibody , and “other” types of complexes . As described , the algorithms were used to refine the separate clusters generated by the rigid body docking program PIPER . For enzyme–inhibitor complexes we refined only the 10 largest clusters and hence restricted consideration to complexes from the two benchmark sets for which these clusters included at least one near-native conformation . In addition , we disregarded four enzyme–inhibitor pairs that form oligomeric rather than binary complexes , resulting in the 25 test problems . The refinement algorithms were also applied to 11 antigen–antibody and 8 “other” type of complexes from the benchmark set 1 [38] that had at least one near-native structure in the 30 largest clusters . We emphasize that tests for most complexes involved separately determined protein structures as given in the benchmark sets [38] , [39] . The exceptions are a few of the antigen–antibody complexes in which the antigen was separately solved but the antibody structure was taken from the complex . The rigid body docking program PIPER [22] , based on the FFT correlation approach , systematically samples billions of docked conformations on a grid . Compared with other FFT-based approaches that use only shape complementarity and electrostatics for scoring , the scoring function in PIPER also includes the statistical pairwise potential DARS ( Decoy As Reference States ) [22] . Since the potential is represented as the sum of a few correlation functions through the eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition of the matrix of the DARS interactions energy coefficients , the energy can be very efficiently evaluated using Fourier transforms . In conjunction with this higher accuracy scoring function , the PIPER program significantly enriches the hit rates among top ranked predictions for the benchmark sets described above . For each complex , we retained the 1000 lowest energy predictions and clustered them using pairwise RMSD as the distance metric [45] . The resulting clusters were ranked based on their size , reflecting a preference for local minima with broad regions of attraction [32] . We have retained at most 30 clusters for each complex , each one being roughly 10 Å RMSD wide . Docking by the SDU algorithms involves the use of two different free energy models . In the rigid body global search the scoring function iswhere the desolvation free energy ΔGdes is estimated by the Atomic Contact Potential [49] , an atom-level extension of the Miyazawa-Jernigan potential [50] , the electrostatic energy ΔEelec is based on the Coulombic formula with distance-dependent dielectrics ϵ = 4r , and the Van der Waals term ΔEvdw is adopted from the Charmm potential [51] . The scaling factor λ∈[0 , 1] is dynamically adjusted during the course of the refinement to improve the quality of the underestimator by dampening the effect of the van der Waals term ΔEvdw and thereby smoothing ΔG . Specifically , whenever a “flat” underestimator U ( this can be determined when the minimum eigenvalue of Q is close to zero ) is being computed with λ = 1 , we gradually reduce λ with a stepsize of 0 . 1 until we obtain a more informative underestimator or λ reaches 0 . In the flexible local minimization we use the Charmm potential with ϵ = 4r , including the internal energy terms , and perform 100 steps of adopted base Newton-Raphson ( ABNR ) minimization allowing for side-chain flexibility in the interface [51] . The distance between two components is separately optimized . Specifically , the ligand is pushed towards or pulled apart from the receptor at a stepsize of 0 . 5 Å along the line segment connecting the two centers of mass . The maximum shift in distance ( which defines locality ) is 2 Å in this study . Each position is followed by a Charmm minimization described above and energy evaluation . Only non-clashing structures are accepted , judged by the condition ΔEvdw&lt;0 . In fact , we found that PIPER had a higher tolerance toward clashing structures and pushing component proteins closer generally resulted in increased positive ΔEvdw . To reduce calls to Charmm minimization , in practice we only pull them apart if necessary , i . e . , when ΔEvdw&gt;0 is found . For simplicity we will call the work involved in evaluating ΔG* ( x ) for each conformation x a function evaluation , although it generally involves several evaluations of ΔG ( x , s ) . As a measure of prediction quality , we select the ligand Cα atoms in the binding site , and calculate the RMSD between their predicted and observed positions . A ligand residue is considered to be in the binding site if any of its atom is within 10 Å of an atom on the receptor . We refer to a structure as near-native ( or a “hit” ) if its ligand binding site Cα RMSD is less than 10 Å . Although such structures are not really close to the native complex , by rigid body docking it is generally difficult to obtain better results . In fact , since the near-native binding region is selected by cluster size using a clustering radius on the order of 10 Å , the goal of this first step is to generate as many such 10 Å RMSD structures as possible . To show the improvements due to the SDU method , we list the rank of the first cluster that includes a hit , as well as the RMSD between the native structure and the center of the cluster . However , as a more appropriate overall performance measure of the refinement , we also note the number of complexes that have at least one prediction with less than 5 Å RMSD from the native structure in the top 5 clusters .</td>\n",

       "      <td>Similarly to protein folding , the association of two proteins is driven by a free energy funnel , determined by favorable interactions in some neighborhood of the native state . We describe a docking method based on stochastic global minimization of funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions ( SE ( 3 ) ) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains . The method , called semi-definite programming-based underestimation ( SDU ) , employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling . While SDU effectively minimizes functions with funnel-shaped basins , its application to docking in the rotational and translational space SE ( 3 ) is not straightforward due to the geometry of that space . We introduce a strategy that uses separate independent variables for side-chain optimization , center-to-center distance of the two proteins , and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules . The removal of the center-to-center distance turns out to vastly improve the efficiency of the search , because the five-dimensional space now exhibits a well-behaved energy surface suitable for underestimation . This algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima and shows similarity to the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions . Results for standard protein docking benchmarks establish that in this space the free energy landscape is a funnel in a reasonably broad neighborhood of the native state and that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation while achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Protein docking is a technique used to predict how two proteins bind together. To do this, researchers use a concept called a \"free energy funnel,\" which tells them which parts of the proteins will fit together nicely and form a strong bond. The researchers then use a special computer program to explore all possible ways that the two proteins might fit together based on this information. However, exploring all possible ways that two proteins might fit together can take a long time, so the researchers use a technique called \"semi-definite programming-based underestimation\" (SDU) to speed up the process. This technique involves finding the lowest possible energy levels for different ways that the proteins might fit together and then using that information to guide the search to find the best possible solution. The researchers found that using this technique made the computer program much more efficient and allowed them to make much more accurate predictions about how the two proteins would fit together.</td>\n",

Extending beyond the protein-coding sequence of a given mRNA is an additional stretch of sequence , harboring signals that govern how much protein is made and how long the mRNA remains in the cell before it is broken down . The incorporation of this end region into mature mRNA is itself subject to change; for the vast majority of human genes , how and why cells use different mRNA ends remains largely unknown . In this work , we surveyed mRNA ends from ∼10 , 000 genes in immune cells from genetically distinct human individuals . We found that mRNA end positions were not randomly distributed , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of regulatory signals that govern mRNA fate . The usage of these mRNA length forms and regulatory elements varied across individuals and could be dissected molecularly . Our results uncover key mechanisms and regulatory effects of transcript end processing , particularly as these are perturbed by genetic differences between humans .   \n",

Due to the ability of the virus to escape host immune responses , designing a successful HIV vaccine has been elusive . Similar to HIV in humans , rhesus macaques can be infected with SIV , a close relative and ancestor of HIV , resulting in simian AIDS . SIVΔnef , a live attenuated form of SIV , protects rhesus macaques from subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIV and is widely viewed as the most effective SIV vaccine . Here , we demonstrate that after vaccination of macaques with SIVΔnef , the immune response initially targets more variable regions of the virus , which the virus rapidly escapes . However , as the virus escapes , the immune response evolves to target more conserved regions of the virus as well as escape variants . This refocused targeting of conserved regions by the immune response provides a new mechanistic model that contributes to our understanding of how SIVΔnef vaccination protects animals from pathogenic challenge with SIV . Our findings also reinforce the importance of developing HIV vaccines that target conserved regions of the virus as well as their potential variants .   \n",

The cytokine interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) plays a critical role for antifungal host defense and was proposed to act by regulating neutrophil recruitment to the oral mucosa . However , although IL-17 can promote neutrophil trafficking in some situations , we recently showed in a mouse model that this is not the case during OPC . Thus , the mechanism governing the neutrophil response to C . albicans remained to be determined . Here , we demonstrate an essential role of IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling in the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation to the infected tissue via enhanced secretion of chemokines and increased output of neutrophils from the bone marrow . We found that IL-1α is released from keratinocytes upon invasion of C . albicans and acts on endothelial cells to induce the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , a key trigger of emergency granulopoiesis . Thereby , IL-1R signaling translates the local response to the fungus in the oral mucosa into a systemic response that critically contributes to protection from infection .   \n",

In 83 countries worldwide , more than 1 . 3 billion people are at risk of infection with an estimated 120 million individuals already infected . A recent publication reviewing the health impact of the first 8 years of the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) demonstrated the enormous health benefits achieved in populations receiving annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) , as a result of infection prevented , disease progression halted , and ancillary treatment of co-infections . To date , however , no studies have estimated the economic value of these health benefits , either to the individuals or the societies afflicted with LF . Our study estimates that US$21 . 8 billion will be gained among individuals benefitting from just the first 8 years of the Global Programme , and an additional US$2 . 2 billion will be saved by the health systems of endemic countries . Treating endemic populations is possible at very low cost – particularly because of the generous drug donations from two pharmaceutical companies – but results in enormous economic benefits . Findings from this study yield a much clearer understanding the GPELF's full economic impact and strengthen the conviction that it is a ‘best buy’ in global health .   \n",

Recent genetic studies have revealed that mutations in glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) , a causative gene of Gaucher disease ( GD ) , are a strong risk for PD . However , its pathological mechanisms leading to PD remain largely unknown . Here , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka which survive long enough for pathological analysis of disease progression . These mutant medaka display not only the phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD but also axonal accumulation of α-syn accompanied by impairment of the autophagy-lysosome pathway . Furthermore , the present study demonstrates this α-syn accumulation has negligible contribution to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . GBA-/- medaka represent a valuable model for exploring the pathological mechanisms of PD with GBA mutations as well as neuronopathic GD , and our findings have important implications for the association of GBA mutations with PD .   \n",

In molecular-level machines , the energetic fluctuations arising from the surrounding solvent become comparable to the energetics that direct each process . In this regime , structural rearrangements may be described as diffusive movements across a free-energy landscape . By adopting this framework , it is possible to quantitatively relate theoretical predictions , computational results , experimental rates and biochemical data , which will allow for a self-consistent description to be obtained . To this end , we have used an explicit-solvent simulation ( 2 . 1 million atoms , 1 . 3 microseconds ) to measure the diffusion along multiple structural coordinates that have been implicated in tRNA translocation in the ribosome . With the diffusion coefficients in hand , we demonstrate how they may be used to bridge theoretical and experimental descriptions of complex collective dynamics in a molecular machine .   \n",

Genomics are increasingly being used to improve our knowledge about disease biology and to identify therapeutic targets in many cancers . Here , we report the largest genomic results of MTC to date . MTC tissue frequently included several mutations . For the first time , anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangements were detected in MTC: one case with a glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK fusion , and another case with an echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusion . The fusion mechanism of the novel GFPT1-ALK fusion was successfully investigated using molecular biology techniques . In addition , an inhibitor of ALK ( crizotinib ) dramatically decreased the number of metastatic MTC lesions harboring the EML4-ALK fusion , thus verifying the fusion as a promising target in MTC . Our findings suggest that using rapidly improving sequencing techniques and accumulated genomic data to comprehensively perform genetic analyses on rare tumors , such as MTC , will help to improve the poor prognosis of orphan diseases .   \n",

Follow study of the asymptomatic cases revealed that 10 . 39% cases transformed into disease and 9 . 09% cases remained as sero-positive even after three years . So progression to clinical disease among asymptomatic individuals was taking place at any time up to three years after the baseline survey . Therefore , in a given period if there are no cases of VL/PKDL for two or more years , it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years , if there are such asymptomatic cases . So , asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme that has been initiated by three adjoining endemic countries .   \n",
       "1374  In this study we describe an adaptation of Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ) for use in the study of gross chromosomal rearrangements ( GCRs ) that occur in S . cerevisiae mutants with increased genome instability . Our previous study found that the presence of a Ty912 element on a nonessential arm of chromosome V resulted in increased rates of non-reciprocal monocentric translocations arising from recombination between the Ty912 on chromosome V and ectopic Ty elements on other chromosomes . Using MLPA , we observed that the majority of the translocations targeted six different translocation hotspots even though there were at least 254 potential targets for Ty-mediated translocations in the S . cerevisiae genome . Most of the observed translocations were formed by RAD52-dependent recombination , although we also identified a RAD52-independent recombination pathway that promoted the formation of the same types of translocations at lower rates . Finally , we found that defects in the ASF1-RTT109–dependent histone H3 lysine 56 ( H3K56 ) acetylation pathway caused increased rates of both Ty-mediated translocations and whole-chromosome duplications ( aneuploidy ) . This aneuploidy often occurred simultaneously with Ty-mediated translocations . Overall , our results demonstrate that MLPA is a rapid , inexpensive method that allows the analysis of the large number of GCRs needed to understand the pathways that suppress or promote genome instability .   \n",

Genomewide proteomics studies , primarily yeast two-hybrid assays , will provide an increasing list of interacting proteins , but only a small fraction of the potential complexes will be amenable to direct experimental analysis . Thus , it is important to develop computational docking methods that can elucidate the details of specific interactions at the atomic level . Protein–protein docking generally starts with a rigid body search that generates a large number of docked conformations with good shape , electrostatic , and chemical complementarity . The conformations are clustered to obtain a manageable number of models , but the current methods are unable to select the most likely structure among these models . Here we describe a refinement algorithm that , applied to the individual clusters , improves the quality of the models . The better models are suitable for higher-accuracy energy calculation , thereby increasing the chances that near-native structures can be identified , and thus the refinement increases the reliability of the entire docking algorithm .   \n",

A key question in the field is how DNA sequence variants impact gene expression , with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence . By contrast , the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown , owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3′ untranslated regions . In this work , we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals . Our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ gene ends , finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements , including miRNA sites . The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals , and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay . Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation . \\n Naturally occurring genetic differences in gene regulation within populations underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical interest [1]–[3] and can serve as the basis for inference of regulatory networks [4] , [5] . A key problem in the field is understanding the molecular mechanisms by which DNA sequence variants give rise to expression change . Recent work has emphasized the importance of sequence differences in regions upstream of gene loci that harbor cis-acting determinants of transcription factor binding [6]–[10] and chromatin architecture [11]–[13] . Much less is known about the role of 3′-end regulation as a determinant of expression variation between individuals . Alternative polyadenylation represents a major regulatory strategy in the human genome , with analysis across tissue types detecting multiple 3′ UTR forms of over half of all human genes [14] . Detailed genetic studies have implicated polymorphisms affecting transcript termination in both Mendelian and complex human disease [15]–[20] . Genomic analyses have hinted at a broader role for genetic differences in RNA 3′-end processing as a driver of expression variation [6] , [8] , [21] , [22] , but the prevalence and the mechanisms of these changes are incompletely understood . Progress in dissecting the genetics of 3′-end processing has been limited in part by fundamental questions about the regulatory information encoded in 3′ UTRs . Single-gene studies have made clear that , in addition to its interplay with exonic splicing [23] , [24] , RNA 3′-end processing can dictate the extent of 3′ UTR sequence incorporated into mature transcripts that governs half-life , translation , and localization [25]–[29]; the efficiency of transcription termination itself can also influence steady-state expression level of a given length form [30]–[34] . In general , however , identifying the regulatory elements that underlie relationships between 3′ UTR sequence and gene expression remains a primary challenge , and for the majority of human genes , the regulatory impact of alternative polyadenylation is unknown . Likewise , the search for molecular players underlying cis-regulation of 3′-end processing at individual gene loci [23] and genome-scale regulation of 3′-end processing in trans [14] , [29] , [35]–[40] is an area of active research . A complete understanding of the genetics of alternative polyadenylation will require maps of transcript end site usage and 3′ cis-regulatory elements , and analysis strategies to integrate the data . Recently developed short-read sequencing methods for transcript ends [40]–[46] have enabled the possibility of quantitative studies of the regulatory architecture of transcript end forms on a genomic scale . In this work , we set out to investigate mechanisms by which alternative polyadenylation impacts gene expression and its variation across genetically distinct human individuals . We used 3′-end RNA-seq [42] to maximize the genomic coverage and precision of transcript end positions , and to measure quantitative expression levels of transcript forms . The results shed light on the architecture of transcript ends and regulatory elements in human 3′ UTRs and the principles of genetic variation in 3′ length form usage . \\n To survey the 3′ ends of transcripts in human B-lymphoblastoid cells , we isolated RNA from cell lines derived from six human individuals and subjected each replicate of each sample to 3′-end RNA-seq , which sequences polyadenylated transcript ends on a genomic scale [42] with strong and significant reproducibility ( Figure S1 ) . Our analysis pipeline , described in Materials and Methods , filtered out likely products of mispriming from A-rich genomic regions [47] and categorized mapping reads in terms of well-defined peaks or dispersed regions of reads with no peak structure ( Table S1 ) . We considered the former to represent the strongest candidates for stable , functional transcript end forms , and focused on these for in-depth analysis , taking the last mapped base of each read as the likely site at which the nascent RNA was cleaved from the processing polymerase and polyadenylated [24] . Across such transcript ends mapping to nuclear-encoded loci , the vast majority of reads ( 87% ) originated from 3′ UTRs of coding genes ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ) ; 80% of transcript ends were consistent with the 3′ ends of previously annotated length forms ( Tables S1 and S2 and Figure S2 ) . Within 40 base pairs of the inferred cleavage position , most transcript end forms harbored a polyadenylation signal sequence: either the canonical A ( A/U ) UAAA [23] or a close variant , or an A-rich stretch [48]–[50] ( Figure S3A ) . Reporter assays confirmed the regulatory importance of A-rich stretches upstream of the inferred cleavage positions in CPSF1 and WDR18 , whose 3′ UTRs lacked canonical polyadenylation signal motifs ( Figure S3C ) . We set out to analyze our data set of 3′ transcript ends with respect to alternative polyadenylation , focusing on a maximum of two abundant , distinguishable transcript forms in a given gene . We considered three patterns of transcript end usage [30]: class I , indicating genes with a single transcript form terminating in an annotated 3′ UTR; class II , genes with alternative polyadenylation in the same annotated 3′ UTR; and class III , genes in which the two alternative polyadenylation forms differed in their composition of coding sequence ( Figure 1B ) . We also observed a small fraction of genes with a single transcript form terminating inside annotated coding exons or introns ( Table S3 ) . The breakdown of transcript forms into these classes revealed alternative polyadenylation reaching our threshold of detection in ∼30% of genes ( Figure 1B ) . Across these genes , we observed the expected enrichment of the A ( A/U ) UAAA polyadenylation signal motif in the distal relative to proximal polyadenylation signals ( Figure S3A ) , correlating with the higher expression levels of the long transcript forms [30] , [51] . The lower-abundance short transcript forms were more likely to harbor an A-rich stretch or no recognizable polyadenylation signal motif upstream of the inferred cleavage position ( Figure S3B ) , lending credence to the notion that the latter regions represent weak recognition sites for the 3′-end processing machinery [48] . We sought to harness our data set of transcript ends to investigate regulatory elements governing translation and transcript half-life , and their relationship to alternative 3′ transcript forms . For this purpose , we applied a motif-search strategy to identify putative microRNA binding sites , A/U rich elements ( AREs ) , G/U-rich elements , binding sites for the Pumilio family of proteins , and Alu transposable elements in 3′ UTRs . We tabulated rates of sequence variation across human populations and observed marked conservation of most regulatory element motifs relative to the background level of 3′ UTR polymorphism ( Figure 2A ) , reflecting a history of purifying selection on these putatively functional regulatory sequences [52]–[54] . We expected that the regulatory logic of alternative polyadenylation would be intimately connected with sequence determinants of transcript half-life or translation in 3′ UTRs . For a given gene subject to alternative polyadenylation , we referred to the region of the 3′ UTR upstream of the proximal cleavage site as “shared” among the alternative polyadenylation length forms , and the span of the 3′ UTR in between the proximal and distal cleavage sites as the “differential” region ( Figure 2B ) . We hypothesized that , if alternative polyadenylation often acted to tune the exposure of cis-regulatory motifs in 3′ UTR sequences , these motifs would preferentially be positioned in differential regions . To test this , we tabulated the positions of each type of regulatory element across our set of alternatively polyadenylated genes in class II . Significance testing revealed a significant enrichment of genes with motifs in the differential regions of 3′ UTRs relative to those with motifs in shared regions ( Figure 2C ) . Analyzing the annotations of genes in these sets , we observed a preponderance of genes with immune-related functions among those with cis-regulatory motifs in the differential regions of 3′ UTRs , while motifs in shared regions of 3′ UTRs were largely detected among genes with housekeeping roles ( Table S5 ) . Thus , for genes carrying out immune processes in B-lymphoblastoid cells , the choice between long and short transcript end forms often exposes or eliminates regulatory information in 3′ UTRs , highlighting the importance of 3′-end processing in the control of gene expression levels for specialized cell functions . To investigate the genetics of RNA 3′-end processing , we first assessed the contribution of genetic differences , relative to experimental and environmental error , to variation of transcript 3′-end positions across the six genotypes of lymphoblastoid cells in our study . For this purpose , we calculated the heritability of length form abundance for each gene , finding 194 coding genes at which the abundances of transcript length forms differed reproducibly ( heritability>0 . 6 ) across human samples ( Table S6 ) . To begin to dissect the molecular basis for natural genetic variation in 3′-end usage at these loci , we considered the potential role for DNA sequence differences at polyadenylation signals , the primary determinants of transcript cleavage and polyadenylation . We reasoned that although such variants were rare in the human population ( Figure 2A ) , some could underlie differences between human individuals in 3′-end length form usage . Consistent with this prediction , genes with highly heritable transcript end positions harbored a single nucleotide polymorphism in polyadenylation signal motif sequence much more often than did the average gene ( 2% of polyadenylation signals at genes with heritable transcript ends , compared to 0 . 3% genome-wide; Fisher's exact p = 0 . 004; Table S6 ) . We hypothesized that naturally occurring genetic variation in RNA 3′-end processing would prove to underlie changes across individuals in steady-state levels of gene expression . To test this , we analyzed the genomic relationship between biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and gene expression differences across our set of lymphoblastoid cell lines from distinct human genotypes . We used a standard regression test of genetic association to evaluate genotype at each such sequence variant as a predictor of expression of the gene in which it lay . The results revealed a significant enrichment of association with expression for variants in polyadenylation signals , relative to the background signal from 3′ UTRs as a whole ( Figure 3A ) . We expected that for a given such variant , the allele conferring a closer match to the canonical polyadenylation signal motif would confer more robust transcription termination , and thus more abundant steady-state levels of transcription , than would the allele weakening the match to the canonical motif . To quantify this effect , we scored each allele in each variant polyadenylation signal with respect to agreement with the canonical motif , and at each variant position , we calculated the difference in scores between alleles . This score difference was a strong predictor of the effect of a given polyadenylation signal variant on steady-state expression levels ( Figure 3B ) , with a departure from the polyadenylation signal motif associated with a drop in expression as predicted . To pursue on a molecular basis the impact of variation across humans in polyadenylation signals , we used our 3′-end RNA-seq data to infer the effects of single-nucleotide variants on usage of 3′ transcript forms at individual genes , and we evaluated these predictions in single-gene 3′ UTR reporter assays . For each gene , toggling natural variant alleles at one nucleotide position in the polyadenylation signal was sufficient to drive differential usage of short and long 3′ transcript forms ( Figure 4 ) . These included variants attenuating usage of 3′ forms of the translation initiation factor EIF2A and the putative DNA methylation enzyme DIP2B , as well as the expected effect of the polymorphic polyadenylation signal on usage of 3′ forms of the inflammation regulator IRF5 [15] . In each of the latter genes , the causal variant conferred significant changes in luciferase protein levels as well as usage of transcript forms ( Figure 4A–F ) . Our set of confirmed causal variants at polyadenylation signals also included that in the transcription factor NAB1 , which attenuated usage of a minor 3′ transcript form with modest effect on luciferase levels ( Figure 4G , H ) . We conclude that sequence differences in polyadenylation signals represent a key mechanism underlying variation between humans in levels of gene expression , with genome-scale trends validated at the single-gene level . We next sought to dissect the mechanisms by which natural variation in 3′-end usage impacted gene expression , using as case studies IRF5 and DIP2B , which lie in genomic regions associated with susceptibility to lupus [15] and colorectal cancer [55] , respectively , as well as NAB1 and EIF2A . In RNA expression measurements using the 3′ UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms of a given gene , one form was detected at higher abundance in each case ( Figure 4B , D , F , H ) . We hypothesized that these abundance differences between length forms could be in part the result of sequence elements that dictate transcript cleavage , polyadenylation , and termination , and in part the result of regulatory elements that affect transcript half-life . To test this , for each gene we first developed expression reporters incorporating only the regions flanking the end positions of each transcript form in turn , which we expected would include the polyadenylation signal and auxiliary sequence motifs underlying 3′-end processing of the respective form while excluding most other 3′ regulatory information . Expression measurements confirmed differences in the strength of these 3′-end processing motifs between length forms for EIF2A , IRF5 , and DIP2B , in that reporters incorporating each of the two 3′-end sequences from a given gene exhibited up to 2 . 5-fold differences in expression ( Figure 5A , C , E ) . To assess the contribution of 3′ regulatory elements that control transcript half-life , we next measured the decay rate of each transcript length form upon addition of actinomycin D in the context of complete 3′ UTRs . Measurements of transcript stability by quantitative PCR and by Northern blot bore out this prediction , with the long transcript form showing reduced half-life relative to the short form for IRF5 [15] and DIP2B ( Figure 5D , F and Figure S4B , C ) , and increased half-life for NAB1 ( Figure 5H and Figure S4D ) . Analyzing these results together with the effects of natural variants in polyadenylation signals ( Figure 4 ) indicates that for a given gene , a variant can abrogate production of a transcript form with strong sequence determinants of 3′-end processing , leaving only the less efficiently processed form and giving rise to lower total expression of the gene product , as in IRF5 and EIF2A . In addition , a variant abrogating production of a transcript form with longer half-life leaves only the less-stable form and reduces total steady-state levels of the gene product , as in IRF5 and DIP2B . As a further investigation of the determinants of abundance of long and short transcript forms for genes subject to natural genetic change in 3′-end processing , we analyzed the role of 3′ regulatory elements in such genes in relation to trans-acting regulatory factors . We identified a candidate ARE in the differential region of the 3′ UTR of IRF5 , i . e . between the positions of alternative 3′ ends observed in our 3′-end RNA-seq; a candidate ARE in the differential region of NAB1; and a candidate binding site for the miRNA miR-101 in the differential region of DIP2B ( Figure 6 ) . To assess the functional relevance of these motifs , we applied a mutagenesis strategy using 3′ UTR reporter constructs for each gene , as above distinguishing between the 3′ UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms and the haplotype producing only the long form ( Figure 4D , F , H ) . For each inferred cis-regulatory element , we assayed the regulatory response of 3′ UTR reporters to the trans-acting factor predicted to mediate its repressive effect: the ARE-binding proteins TTP and AUF1 for IRF5 and NAB1 , respectively , and a mimic of miR-101 for DIP2B . In each case , expression measurements from mutagenized reporter constructs established the respective sequence element as necessary for full repression of the long form of its host UTR ( Figure 6 ) , validating our motif inferences . Among experiments that used haplotypes producing both short and long 3′ forms of the respective UTRs , motifs in the differential region were only necessary for repression by trans-acting factors in the case of NAB1 ( Figure 6C ) , for which the population of transcripts arising from this haplotype was dominated by the long form ( Figure 4H ) . Taken together , our results illustrate the complexity of regulatory information in 3′ UTRs , as determinants of RNA 3′-end processing and transcript fate each contribute to the final expression level of the host gene . We conclude that , for these case studies , integrating predicted regulatory motifs with knowledge of transcript end positions is essential in the effort to relate genotype to gene expression . We next aimed to shed light on the biological context in which differences in regulatory responsiveness could manifest between long and short transcript forms . For this purpose , we focused on natural variation in alternative polyadenylation at the immune regulator IRF5 . In response to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , immune genes undergo an immediate spike in expression , followed by dampening to a more modest steady-state level mediated by the ARE-binding protein TTP [56]–[58] . Motivated by our discovery of a repressive ARE in the differential region of IRF5 ( Figure 6A ) , we hypothesized that the genetically determined production of long and short 3′ mRNA forms of this gene would be associated with different patterns of regulatory behavior after induction . To test this , we treated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from genetically distinct individuals with LPS and , in each culture , measured the recovery of expression levels of IRF5 transcript forms over time . The results , shown in Figure 7 , revealed , after an initial overshoot in expression , a difference of up to 2-fold in the time to reach steady-state expression between long and short mRNA forms , with the long form downregulated to steady-state more quickly after induction as predicted , given the presence of the repressive ARE in the latter transcript . Variation in IRF5 expression recovery across B-lymphoblastoid lines was associated with genotype at the proximal polyadenylation signal in the IRF5 3′ UTR: haplotypes encoding the long form of IRF5 conferred rapid repression after induction ( Figure 7B ) relative to haplotypes encoding the short form ( Figure 7A ) . These findings suggest that genetic variation in 3′-end processing dictates differences across individuals in the regulatory dynamics of IRF5 , further underscoring the power of our approach to identify biologically relevant regulatory effects of 3′-end processing . Our molecular confirmation of cis-regulatory elements in 3′ UTRs inferred from sequence search methods ( Figure 6 ) suggested that such inference could provide a mechanistic understanding of gene expression on a genomic scale . In particular , we expected that sequence variants between individuals in 3′ regulatory elements would be significant predictors of variation in steady-state expression of the genes in which they lay . To test this notion , we first tabulated all single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the cell lines of our data set which overlapped with 3′ regulatory motifs and Alu elements in 3′ UTRs . We next classified these motifs according to the impact of alternative polyadenylation on their positions in 3′ UTRs , and we used association tests to assess the strength of each motif variant in each class as a predictor of steady-state expression of its respective gene . The results ( Figure 8 ) revealed association with expression across human individuals , for variants in AREs , G/U-rich elements , Pumilio sites , and Alu elements . The relationship with expression was striking and significant for variants in regions of 3′ UTRs constitutively incorporated into mature messages ( Figure 8 ) . Polymorphic motifs incorporated into low-abundance 3′ length forms showed no evidence of association with expression changes in their respective genes , consistent with the minor contribution of these forms; by the same token , polymorphic motifs in regions incorporated into the predominant 3′ length forms of mRNAs were more strongly associated with expression of their respective genes , though not significantly so ( Figure 8 ) . As expected [6] , the relationship between sequence variants and gene expression did not manifest for miRNA sites ( data not shown ) . These findings highlight the relevance of 3′ regulatory motifs as predictors of expression variation across human individuals , when integrated with knowledge of transcript length forms from our sequencing strategy . \\n Alternative polyadenylation is prevalent in the human transcriptome , and in landmark cases , variation across individuals in the use of 3′ length forms of RNAs has been shown to underlie human disease [15]–[20] . However , for most human genes , the regulatory importance of changes in transcript ends between individuals is incompletely understood , owing to the challenges of measuring 3′-end usage and identifying functional regulatory elements in 3′ UTRs . We have developed a spatially precise , quantitative , high-throughput sequencing approach for 3′ ends , complementing now-classic studies of expressed sequence tags [30] , [36] , [48] , [51] , [59]–[61] . We have used the resulting transcript end positions and abundances to pioneer an analysis approach which integrates bioinformatic predictions of 3′ regulatory motifs , genomic analysis , and molecular genetics . With this strategy , we have established a regulatory map of transcript ends and functional elements in the 3′ UTRs of lymphoblastoid cells , and we have abstracted genomic principles of alternative polyadenylation and natural genetic variation in this cell type . Our mapping of 3′-end length forms and sequence motifs in 3′ UTRs revealed an intuitive logic in which the choice between short and long UTR forms governs the incorporation of regulatory elements into mature messages [36] , [61] . We note that the 3′ length forms we report in B-lymphoblastoid cells represent a subset of the total complement of 3′ UTR lengths used across tissues . As such , we hypothesize that surveys of tissue types will ultimately reveal transcript forms of many genes , used in particular contexts , that incorporate 3′ regulatory information to different extents . The ability to tune the responsiveness to trans-acting input itself distinguishes alternative polyadenylation from other transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms , providing a compelling model for the particular advantage of 3′-end processing as a regulatory strategy and a rationale for its prevalence in mammalian genomes . In comparisons across cell lines from genetically distinct individuals , we analyzed the regulatory importance of genetic changes at 3′ transcript ends . We uncovered a key role for polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals as a driver of changes in gene expression , and we detailed the molecular mechanisms at play . The polyadenylation variants we study here dictate the production of transcript forms with different determinants of 3′-end processing , different half-lives , and different recognition sites for trans-acting regulators . These findings establish a connection between observational studies of transcript 3′ length forms across human populations [21] , [22] and regulatory effects of this variation . In the case of IRF5 , we discovered that a naturally occurring genetic change in usage of 3′ RNA forms can serve to tune the kinetics of recovery of expression after induction by lipopolysaccharide . Thus , against the backdrop of prior studies of this lupus susceptibility gene [15] , we have uncovered an additional dimension by which variation in RNA 3′-end processing affects regulatory behavior . Given these case-study results as a validation of our genome-scale analyses , we speculate that many genetic variants with biologically relevant effects mediated by RNA 3′-end processing remain to be discovered in the human population . We have also shown that polymorphisms in 3′ motifs that govern transcript fate can serve as predictors of steady-state levels of the genes in which they lie . In light of the ultimate goal of predicting regulatory and phenotypic effects from human genome sequence , our results indicate that analysis strategies using sequence determinants of transcription initiation and splicing alone are likely to provide an incomplete model of expression variation . Importantly , however , our work makes clear that binding sites for regulators of mRNA localization , half-life , and translation at 3′ ends are themselves only part of the regulatory landscape . Rather , a complete understanding of the genetics of gene expression will integrate the usage of RNA 3′-end processing signals with the effects of 3′ sequence elements that control transcript fate . We anticipate that abundances and positions of transcript ends observed in 3′-end RNA-seq will prove to be a key component in the systems-level modeling of regulatory networks and their variation . In summary , while the genetic study of RNA 3′-end processing is in its infancy , our work and that of others [15]–[22] establishes that variation at 3′ ends can be a critical determinant of regulatory behaviors . However , for the vast majority of human genes , the importance of 3′ regulatory change remains unknown . Our single-gene experiments detail the expression effects of 3′ UTR variation in the disease-associated genes IRF5 [15] and DIP2B [55]; the potential for regulatory variants as drivers of human disease will serve as continued motivation for genomic and genetic analyses of expression change . \\n Two biological replicates of each of the human lymphoblastoid cell lines GM10860 , GM17106 , GM17189 , GM17207 , GM17220 , and GM17253 ( Coriell Institute ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamate and 15% fetal bovine serum . Cells were incubated at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide . Total RNA was extracted from ∼107 cells using TRIzol reagent ( Invitrogen ) , and genomic DNA was removed from RNA using Turbo DNase ( Ambion ) . Polyadenylated RNA was selected from 10 µg of total RNA using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit ( Invitrogen ) , and was fragmented for 3 minutes at 70°C using 10× Fragmentation Reagent ( Ambion ) . After ethanol precipitation , polyadenylated RNA fragments were selected using the Dynabeads mRNA purification kit and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II ( Invitrogen ) and anchored oligo-dT ( Invitrogen ) . Double-stranded cDNA was generated using RNase H ( Invitrogen ) and DNA Pol I ( Invitrogen ) , end-repaired using T4 DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) , Klenow DNA Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) , and T4 PNK ( New England Biolabs ) , and then adenylated using Klenow 3′ to 5′ exo minus ( New England Biolabs ) . Illumina paired-end adapters were ligated to the adenylated cDNA using T4 DNA Ligase ( Enzymatics ) . Ligated cDNA was purified on a 2% agarose gel and then amplified by performing 12 cycles of PCR using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . Libraries were sequenced using 40 bp paired-end modules on an Illumina 2G Genome Analyzer . Consecutive T's from the beginning of all reads were trimmed and classified before mapping: for a given read , if there were more than 20 consecutive T's or if neither mate of a read pair had a stretch of T's , the read was not included in further analysis . For mapping , the set of single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) segregating in the CEU population was downloaded from HapMap phase II+III , release 27 ( ftp://ftp . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov/hapmap/genotypes ) , and used to modify the human reference genome ( hg18; [62] ) by incorporating the appropriate ambiguous bases at each SNP position . All reads were then mapped to this modified genome and to the associated splicing junctions in the Known Genes database of the UCSC genome browser [63] using MOSAIK ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) . For a given length of trimmed T's , nT , a splicing junction reference was created by concatenating 37 - nT bp from each exon adjacent to the splicing junction to ensure that the reads mapped across the splicing junction . If the reads mapped to both the genome and a splicing junction , the mapping with smaller number of mismatches was used . Only uniquely mapped reads with two or fewer mismatches in each mate were retained . Trimmed T's were then compared to the genome sequence; reads with >2 mismatches to the genome in this poly-T tract were retained for analysis . We inferred that a given read was transcribed from the minus strand of the genome if , when it was mapped to the reference genome , the position of its poly-T tract had a lower coordinate position than the mapped position of the other end of the read; we inferred that a read was transcribed from the plus strand of the genome if the mapped position of its poly-T tract had a higher coordinate position than the position of the other end . Mapped reads yielded an average coverage of 22 . 6% of UCSC annotated 3′ UTRs with a depth of 97 . 8 reads/bp for the covered bases for each sample . The last 100 bp of annotated 3′ UTRs were even more highly represented in libraries , with an average coverage of 43 . 4% and an average depth of 211 . 1 reads/bp . Mapped reads from all samples were pooled , sorted according to the polyA positions , defined as the coordinate of the base adjacent to the polyA tail , and then grouped into tag clusters as follows . For each strand of each chromosome , the 5′ boundary of a tag cluster was set as the polyA position of the first read , and then reads were sequentially added to this unit until the polyA position of the next read was more than 15 bp away . The latter position then became the 5′ boundary of the next tag cluster . Most tag clusters spanned less than 24 bp , but if the polyA positions in a cluster spanned more than 40 bp , we applied a peak-finding algorithm as follows . For each genome coordinate in the region corresponding to the tag cluster , we defined the read count as the number of reads whose polyA position overlapped the coordinate . From these we first identified the genome coordinate ( posM ) with the greatest read count ( MaxHeight ) . We then delineated a window 40 bp upstream and 40 bp downstream of this coordinate . Within this window , we retained all coordinates with read counts greater than 10% of MaxHeight . Of these , we identified the most 5′ and 3′ polyA positions ( posL and posR ) . All reads in the tag cluster were then divided into three new candidate tag clusters: reads with positions 5′ to posL , reads with positions including and between posL and posR , and reads with positions 3′ to posR . If the distance between posL and posR was longer than 40 bp , the middle candidate tag cluster was eliminated from further analysis . If the read counts of all coordinates in a candidate tag cluster were below 10% of MaxHeight , the candidate unit was eliminated . If a candidate tag cluster contained coordinates with read counts larger than 10% of MaxHeight , we identified the coordinate with the largest read count within this candidate tag cluster and repeated the peak-finding algorithm . For each tag cluster retained for analysis , we defined the polyA position of the unit as the median of the polyA positions of all reads encompassed by the unit . After establishing that the stretch of A's in each read represented a mismatch to the genome sequence ( see above ) , we filtered out reads with a potential origin from internal priming from A-rich regions of the genome by removing any tag cluster whose defined polyA position was followed by 10 or more A's in the genome sequence within 20 bp . We also filtered out reads with a potential origin as PCR clones or false mapping as follows . We expected that for a given set of paired-end reads falling into a tag cluster , the characteristics of read ends originating from biological 3′-end processing should be distinct from the characteristics of read ends originating from fragmentation , reverse transcription , and ligation during RNA-seq library preparation . In particular , we reasoned that the polyA positions of a set of reads in a tag cluster with origin as a biologically relevant transcript would be less heterogeneous than the positions of the other mates of the reads . If the opposite were true , we considered the tag cluster to be a likely product of false mapping or PCR duplication . As such , we retained a tag cluster for analysis only if the precision of polyA positions across the reads of the unit was greater than the precision of the positions of the other mates . The precision was calculated by where ni is the number of reads at the ith position and N is the total number of reads in the tag cluster . We also filtered out any tag cluster whose total read count across all samples amounted to fewer than 50 reads . For tag clusters with read counts between 50 and 100 , we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient R between each pair of the two biological replicates across the six cell line samples , and eliminated the tag cluster from further analysis if the absolute value of R was less than 0 . 5 . For use in searches for regulatory motifs , we harnessed all 3′-end RNA-seq reads in tag clusters from all samples to define a consensus base at each position in 3′ UTRs as follows . At every genomic coordinate covered by five or more 3′-end RNA-seq reads , the consensus nucleotide was chosen as that with highest frequency across the sample . If the second most abundant base was more than 20% in abundance , it was incorporated into the consensus using an ambiguous base notation ( M = A or C , R = A or G , W = A or T , S = C or G , Y = C or T , K = G or T ) . For every tag cluster , the consensus sequence of the region 40 bp upstream from the polyA position was searched for a polyadenylation signal using the known hexamer motifs sorted by their abundance in the human genome from [30] . Polyadenylation signals with higher abundance were given higher priority when there was more than one instance in the 40 bp upstream window . In the absence of a match to these motifs , the 40 bp upstream window was searched for an A-rich stretch as follows . We identified any 9 bp regions containing at least 6 A's and considered each such region a candidate polyadenylation signal; if no such candidate signal were present , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable polyadenylation signal . If more than one candidate signal was present , we retained the one with the most A's . For each boundary of this region , if the boundary nucleotide was an A , the region was extended to include all consecutive A's . If the first base was not an A , it was trimmed until the first base was an A . To find upstream U-rich elements ( USE ) , for a given tag cluster , we identified a candidate USE as the 9-bp window with the highest number of T's in the consensus sequence , within 30 bp upstream of the polyadenylation signal . If there were fewer than six T's or if the candidate did not have three consecutive T's , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable USE . For each boundary of a given candidate window , if the boundary nucleotide was a T , the window wasextended if there was a T in the adjacent 2 bp and the proportion of T's in the window was above 65%; if the boundary base was not a T , we trimmed the candidate window until a T was reached . To find downstream U/G-rich elements ( DSE ) , for a given tag cluster , we identified a candidate DSE as the 9-bp window with the highest number of T's in the consensus sequence , within 40 bp downstream of the poly-A position . If there were fewer than five T's or if the window did not contain at least one of the strings TTT , TGTG , GTGT , GTCT , CTGT , TCTG , or TGTC , we considered the tag cluster not to have an identifiable DSE . For each boundary of a given candidate window , if the boundary nucleotide was a T , the window was extended if there was a T in the adjacent 2 bp and the proportion of T's in the window was above 50%; if the boundary base was not a T , we trimmed the candidate window until a T was reached . Human gene annotations were downloaded from the Known Genes database of the UCSC Genome Browser [63] . Among the UCSC transcript annotations that overlapped the start and end positions of a tag cluster , the annotation with the minimum distance between the annotated 3′-end position and the polyA position of the tag cluster was chosen . If there were multiple annotations with the same 3′-end positions , we chose the annotation with greatest degree of overlap between the tag cluster consensus sequence and the annotated exons . The genomic coordinates of human expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ) with polyA tails were downloaded from the polyA_db2 database [64] . The genomic coordinates were converted from hg17 to hg18 using the liftOver tool from the UCSC Genome Browser [65] . If the coordinate of polyA_db2 EST was between the start and end position of a tag cluster , we considered the length form corresponding to the unit to be supported by the EST . All tag clusters with the same UCSC gene annotation were categorized as associated with the gene , and only the two tag clusters with the highest expression per gene were used for classification of alternative polyadenylation . We classified each gene as follows: class I if there was only one tag cluster overlapping with the annotated 3′ UTR of the gene; class II if both tag clusters overlapped with the annotated 3′ UTR of the gene and they were associated with the same UCSC transcript ID; class III if one of the tag clusters overlapped witha coding exon or intron , or if both tag clusters overlapped with 3′ UTRs with different UCSC transcript IDs . We calculated the broad-sense heritability in polyA positions using biological replicates of 3′-end RNA-seq across the six human cell lines as follows . For a given gene , we considered the polyA position of the most abundant tag cluster in each replicate of each sample as a quantitative trait , and calculated the heritability H2 of this trait from intraclass correlations [66] given by the following equations . Here , indices i and j refer to sample and replicate , respectively; is the polyA position for sample i , replicate j; is the average between two replicates for sample i; is the average of all samples and replicates; MSe is the error mean square ( within-individual ) and MSb is the between-individual mean square . Heritability of total expression levels for each gene was calculated analogously , using as a quantitative trait the sum of read counts across the gene normalized by the sum of all reads . To identify microRNA binding sites in 3′ UTRs , the Perl script from TargetScan Release 5 . 2 [67] was used to predict miRNA binding sites in the 3′ UTR sequences of all expressed genes . miRNA sequences and families were downloaded from the TargetScan database . Only predicted binding sites with context scores less than −0 . 4 were used for analysis . To identify AU-rich elements , the class II motif WWWT ( ATTTA ) TTTW was searched in the 3′ UTR sequences of all expressed genes allowing up to one mismatch outside the central pentamer , ATTTA . Overlapping motifs were combined . To identify GU-rich destabilizing elements , the motif TGTTTGTTTGT was searched in 3′ UTR sequences allowing up to one mismatch . To identify Pumilio binding elements , the motif TGTANATA was searched in 3′ UTR sequences . Alu transposable element motifs were taken from RepeatMasker ( www . repeatmasker . org ) downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser . We note that each search strategy used human sequence data alone rather than inter- or intra-species conservation to identify motifs . SNPs within the human population were downloaded from the 1000 Genomes Project database [68] . Genomic coordinates were converted from hg19 to hg18 using the liftOver tool from the UCSC Genome Browser [65] . For each regulatory element motif , the SNP rate was calculated as the total number of SNPs within all motif matches divided by the sum of the lengths of all matches . For the background model of sequence variation in 3′ UTRs used in Table S4 , we first tabulated all instances of A , C , T , and G across all positions of 3′ UTR sequences in the hg18 human reference genome , where the boundaries of 3′-ends were taken from our compendium of 3′-end RNA-seq data for genes expressed in our samples . We refer to these frequencies as P ( A ) , P ( C ) , P ( T ) , and P ( G ) , respectively . We then tabulated the SNP rate separately for each of these four sets of base positions from the 1000 Genomes data set , which we refer to as P ( SNP , A ) , P ( SNP , C ) , P ( SNP , T ) , and P ( SNP , G ) , respectively . We used these values to calculate the expected density of polymorphisms for the stretch of genome corresponding to a given 3′ motif match as: where is the sequence of bases of length Ns corresponding to the motif match in the human reference genome and P ( SNP|si ) is the probability of a single-nucleotide polymorphism for the nucleotide si at position i , calculated as: For each regulatory motif , P ( SNP|s ) was calculated for every instance of a motif match across all 3′ UTRs in the reference genomefor genes expressed in our samples , and the lower and upper bounds listed in Table S4 were taken as the minimum and maximum values of this distribution , respectively . For miRNA binding sites , only the 7-mer seed sequence was used . The DEFOG web-based tool ( http://www . mooneygroup . org/defog ) was used for Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis in Table S5 as follows . For each type of regulatory element analyzed in Figure 2C , we tabulated a list of class II genes with motifs in the shared region only , and combined these lists across elements . For each Gene Ontology term , we then evaluated the significance of the representation of genes annotated in the term in this list , relative to a background set of class II genes harboring at least one motif , using DEFOG with default parameters . Separately , we tabulated an analogous combined list of class II genes with motifs in the differential region only and repeated the DEFOG analysis . To find polymorphisms in 3′ UTRs across the six individuals of our sample , we generated mRNA-seq libraries [69] from one biological replicate of each cell line sample , and sequenced using 36 bp paired-end modules on an Illumina 2G Genome Analyzer , resulting in 21 to 24 million reads per sample . The sequenced reads were mapped to the human genome ( hg18 ) using MOSAIK ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) . Mapped reads ( 10 to 14 million per sample ) yielded an average coverage of 48% of UCSC annotated exons with an average depth of 27 reads/base for the covered bases . Mapped reads were used to call SNPs using GigaBayes ( http://bioinformatics . bc . edu/marthlab/Software_Release ) with options –ploidy diploid –O 3 –indel –CAL 10 . Only SNPs with a quality score higher than 0 . 99 were retained for analysis . This set of SNPs was used in association tests with total gene expression levels as follows . Given tag cluster definitions for each gene from analysis of 3′-end RNA-seq libraries ( see above ) , we calculated a normalized expression level for each tag cluster in each sample as the ratio between the number of 3′-end RNA-seq reads mapping within the tag cluster boundaries in the sample and the total number of mapped 3′-end RNA-seq reads in the sample . We then defined the expression level of a given gene in a given sample as the sum of all normalized expression levels across all tag clusters in that gene . To get a final estimate of gene expression level for use in association tests in Figure 3 and Figure 8 , we summed expression values across the two replicate samples from each cell line . For each SNP in the 3′ UTR of a gene , we identified the major allele across all cell lines and scored each diploid genotype in terms of the number of major alleles ( values ranging from 0 to 2 ) . Given the complete matrix of gene expression levels and genotypes across all six cell lines , we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient R between allele counts and the started logarithm of the gene expression level . For Figure 3A and Figure 8 , we used the absolute value of R as the association statistic , and for Figure 3B , we used the signed value of R . In cases of alternative polyadenylation , SNPs in polyadenylation signals upstream of a maximum of two major length forms were considered for association tests . To analyze the effect of genetic variation in polyadenylation signal strength on expression in Figure 3B , each allele of each polyadenylation signal was assigned a score: 1 if the signal was AATAAA or ATTAAA , 0 . 5 if the signal was a match to the “variant” polyadenylation motifs in [30] , and 0 otherwise . The polyadenylation signal strength difference was calculated by subtracting the strength of the minor allele from the major allele . In Figure 3A , we analyzed SNPs in 3′ UTRs for 4214 genes and SNPs in polyadenylation signals for 33 genes . In Figure 8 , we analyzed regulatory element SNPs in 62 , 16 , 7 , and 20 genes respectively in 3′ UTRs of class I genes , shared regions of 3′ UTRs of class II genes , differential regions of 3′ UTRs of class II genes whose long forms were more abundant , and differential regions of 3′ UTRs of class II genes whose short forms were more abundant . A psiCheck-2 vector ( Promega ) was modified to generate a 3′ UTR reporter vector , pOKY001 ( Figure S5 and Table S8 ) , in which we removed the SV40 late polyA signal from the firefly luciferase gene and replaced it with a tag for ligation independent cloning ( LIC ) [70] of 3′ UTR sequences of interest . Genomic DNA was isolated from lymphoblastoid cell lines using the MasterPure DNA Purification Kit ( Epicentre ) , and 3′ UTR sequences were amplified from genomic DNA using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) with PCR primers with LIC tags . PCR products were cloned into pOKY001 using LIC , and plasmids were purified using Plasmid Midi Kit ( Qiagen ) . Site-directed mutagenesis of plasmids was performed using QuikChange XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit ( Agilent ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . All primers used for PCR and mutagenesis are listed in Table S7 . Cloned sequences of all reporter vectors were checked by capillary sequencing . The list of reporter vectors is provided in Table S8 . HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% non-essential amino acids in six-well culture plates . For each of two independent transfections for each construct , at 90% confluency , 1 µg of plasmid DNA was transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . After incubating at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide for 24 h , the cells were washed with Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline ( DPBS ) , detached from plates by adding 300 µL of trypsin-EDTA and incubated at 37 degrees for 5 minutes . After adding 900 µL of media , the detached cells were split into three 2 mL tubes , and pelleted by spinning at 1000× g for 3 minutes . The cell pellets were washed with DPBS and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C . Given one cell pellet from each of two reporter transfections ( see above ) , cells from each pellet were lysed and used for two technical replicates of a dual luciferase assay using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System ( Promega ) . Luminescence from the activities of firefly and Renilla luciferases were measured sequentially in a Turner BioSystems Veritas Luminometer . The ratio of luminescence measurements between Firefly and Renilla luciferases was used for all analyses . To measure expression of short and long forms for a given gene with alternative polyadenylation , we considered quantitative PCR assays that would interrogate regions just upstream of the inferred cleavage sites of the short and long forms ( which we refer to below as SU and LU , respectively ) . We reasoned that expression measurements of SU would reflect abundance of both the short and long transcript forms , whereas LU would reflect abundance of the long form only . For a given transcript in a given experiment , the absolute mRNA level ( calculated from quantitative PCR reactions on a biological sample and standards , as described below ) from the primer set amplifying LU was used as the expression level for the long form; the expression level of the short form was calculated by subtracting the absolute mRNA level of LU from the absolute mRNA level of SU for all genes except IRF5 . Primer sequences for IRF5 were taken from [15] , where the primer set for SU hybridized to the polyA tail and only amplified the short form . Thus , for IRF5 , the mRNA count from SU was used as the expression level for the short form . All other primers were designed using Primer3 Plus [71] , checked for potential hairpins and primer dimers using BeaconDesigner Web Edition ( PREMIER Biosoft International ) . Primers were synthesized by Elim Biopharmaceuticals . For each transcript in each experiment , measurements were normalized by absolute mRNA counts of Renilla luciferase or GAPDH genes . All primer sequences are in Table S7 . Expression measurements on cells transfected with 3′ UTR reporters were performed as follows . Given one cell pellet from each of two transfections ( see above ) , total RNA was isolated from each pellet separately using TRIzol ( Invitrogen ) . For each sample , genomic DNA was removed from 10 µg of total RNA using TurboDNase ( Ambion ) . Single-stranded cDNA was synthesized from 2 µg of DNased RNA using oligo ( dT ) ( Invitrogen ) and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase ( Invitrogen ) , and then RNA was removed using RNase H ( Invitrogen ) . For each of two technical replicates for each primer set and sample , the cDNA was amplified using the DyNamo HS SYBR Green QPCR Kit ( Thermo Scientific ) for 40 cycles on a Strategene MX3000P qPCR instrument . We calculated absolute numbers of mRNA molecules amplified from each primer set in each experiment by comparing the number of amplification cycles taken to reach a given threshold against a standard curve constructed using samples of a synthetic template ( gBlocks Gene Fragments , Integrated DNA Technologies ) of known absolute numbers of molecules , in serial dilutions extending from 107 to 101 molecules . Reporters incorporating 3′ processing signals were constructed as follows . For each length form of each gene , we aimed to clone a region centered on the cleavage site as inferred from the transcript end position observed in 3′-end RNA-seq , bounded by the 40 bp upstream and 40 bp downstream in the genomic sequences and flanked by LIC tags ( region sequences for EIF2A , IRF5 , DIP2B , and NAB1 were taken from the haplotype giving rise to production of both long and short forms for cell lines GM17220 , GM10860 , GM10860 , and GM17220 respectively ) . This 115-bp construct was produced by PCR stitching two opposite-strand DNA oligos of 60 bp and 78 bp ( Integrated DNA Technologies ) with 23 bp overlap using Phusion HF Polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) for 3 cycles . PCR products were cloned into pOKY001 and purified as described above . Transfection and dual luciferase assay were performed as above . For each transcript half-life measurement , cells transfected with a luciferase reporter harboring the complete 3′ UTR from the haplotype giving rise to production of both long and short forms of a given gene were incubated at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide for ∼24 h . A stock solution of actinomycin D dissolved in DMSO was added to achieve a final actinomycin D concentration in tissue culture media of 10 µg/mL . After incubation times as indicated in Figure 5 and Figure S4 , cells were harvested for quantitative PCR measurements as above or Northern blotting as described below . To generate expression vectors for ARE-binding proteins , the tristetraprolin ( gene name ZFP36 ) coding sequence was amplified from the vector pGFP-TTP and the AUF1 p37 coding sequence from pCDEF-His-AUF1-p37 ( both kind gifts from B . Glaunsinger ) . Each gene was cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector ( Invitrogen ) . Syn-has-miR-101 , a miRNA mimic of has-miR-101 , was purchased from Qiagen ( MSY0000099 ) . For dose-response assays , expression vectors or miRNA mimic were mixed with the corresponding luciferase reporter vectors ( Figure 6 ) and then transfected as above . Lipopolysaccharide from E . coli K12 ( Invivogen ) was added to each of the human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines GM10860 , GM17106 , and , GM17207 to a final concentration of 5 µg/mL in 6-well tissue culture plates , and incubated at 37°C under 5% carbon dioxide . The cells were harvested after 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , and 16 hours by centrifuging at 1000× g for 3 minutes , washing with DPBS , and then flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen . RNA was isolated using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) . The DIG Northern Starter Kit ( Roche ) was used for Northern blotting . A 400 bp region of firefly luciferase gene was amplified from luciferase reporter vector pOKY001 , and cloned into pcDNA3 vector ( Invitrogen ) . A digoxigenin ( DIG ) labeled RNA probe for firefly luciferase was created by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase after linearizing the plasmid with BamHI . Total RNA isolated using Trizol ( Invitrogen ) was cleaned using RNeasy columns ( Qiagen ) with on-column DNase-digestion . Between 1 and 10 µg of total RNA was loaded and run on 1% denaturing agarose gels . The gels were stained with SYBR Gold ( Invitrogen ) and then the separated RNA was blotted onto nylon membranes ( Roche ) and UV cross-linked . Both the gels and the membranes were imaged on Blue Light Transilluminator ( Invitrogen ) to check the transfer of SYBR-stained RNA . 28S ribosomal RNA bands on the membranes were used as the loading control in Figure S4 . Each membrane was subjected to prehybridization , probe hybridization , low and high stringency washing , and detection procedures recommended by the manufacturer ( Roche ) . Anti-digoxigenin-AP ( Roche ) and CDP-Star ( Roche ) were used for chemiluminescent detection of the DIG-labeled RNA probe . To maximize length resolution for EIF2A , total RNA was incubated at 37°C for 30 min with RNaseH ( Invitrogen ) and an oligo antisense to a 20 bp region upstream of the binding site for the Northern probe in the firefly gene . For DIP2B , the denaturing agarose gel was treated with 0 . 05% NaOH and washed with water before blotting onto the nylon membrane .

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design . \\n Two decades ago , a report described a cohort of rhesus macaques infected with the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) , SIVΔnef , and subsequently protected from pathogenic wild-type SIV challenge [1] . Since then , numerous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of SIVΔnef-induced protection , ranging from complete protection with sterilizing immunity to partial protection with two or more logs reduction in peak and set-point viremia [2–6] . Remarkably , presumably in part due to the replication of SIVΔnef in mucosal sites [7] , robust protection has been also been documented following mucosal challenges [3–5] . SIVΔnef has also induced significant protection against heterologous challenge , albeit less effectively than against homologous challenge [4 , 5] . However , studies describing disease progression in SIVΔnef-vaccinated infant macaques and a subset of adult non-human primates precluded live attenuated HIV from being developed as a vaccine in human subjects [8–10] . Due to concerns over safety , research on SIVΔnef and related LASIV vaccines has shifted from safety-and-efficacy determination to mechanism-of-action delineation . As the most effective lentiviral vaccine , SIVΔnef has been extensively studied in order to shed light on the correlates of vaccine-mediated protection . However , no immunological correlate or mode of action has consistently been identified as being responsible for protection against pathogenic challenge . SIVΔnef generates a diverse SIV-specific antibody response [11 , 12] and macaques vaccinated with the related attenuated virus SIVΔ3 and lacking the Mamu-A*01 MHC I allele show effective control of pathogenic viral challenge despite CD8 T cell depletion [13] , implying that humoral immunity may play a significant role , at least in some genotypic backgrounds . Innate immunity has also been implicated as a correlate of SIVΔnef-induced protection [3] . SIVΔnef infection induces potent CD8 T cell responses similar in magnitude to wild-type SIV infection [14] , and multiple studies have implicated SIV-specific CD8 T cells in the protection induced by SIVΔnef [4–6 , 15] . Most recently , Fukazawa et al . [6] correlated the magnitude of lymph node SIV-specific T cell responses with protection elicited by a range of different LASIV strains , including SIVΔnef . Finally , studies in a related vaccine challenge model involving vaccination with an attenuated SHIV strain have implicated SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses in the female reproductive tract as playing a crucial role in protection [16] . In this work , we sought to scrutinize the interplay of the attenuated virus and the immune response at a high resolution . We chose to focus on the CD8 T cell response as the most likely immune correlate for protection given that previous studies have demonstrated: potent anti-lentiviral activity of CD8 T cells in vitro [17–21]; increased viremia during chronic SIV infection after CD8 T cell depletion [22]; the ability of a live attenuated SHIV vaccine containing HIV env to protect vaccinated macaques against SIVmac239 challenge [16 , 23]; SIVΔnef-mediated protection of animals challenged with wild-type SIVmac239 containing highly heterologous env sequences [24]; and a correlation between increased LASIV-induced protection and higher magnitude of SIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells in the lymph nodes of vaccinated animals [6] . A distinguishing feature of the SIVΔnef and SIVΔ3 vaccines is the gradual increase in protection against wild-type SIV challenge during the first 15–20 weeks of vaccination [2 , 25] . Given the low-level replication rate of SIVΔnef after initial control of viremia by 8–12 weeks after vaccination , it was unknown whether SIVΔnef undergoes sequence evolution after acute infection . The only previously documented sequence evolution of SIVΔnef was in the Tat SL8 epitope , which escaped as early as 3 weeks post-infection [26] . We hypothesized that , despite low levels of viral replication , SIVΔnef undergoes sequence evolution during the vaccination period , which would induce a shift in the specificity of the CD8 T cell response between week 5 , when the animals are not protected , and week 20 , where increased protection plateaus [12] . We made use of high-throughput deep sequencing to quantify SIVΔnef sequence variants and their frequencies in vaccinated animals , including those with undetectable plasma viral loads . Concurrently , we fine-mapped the CD8 T cell responses at the epitope level at week 5 and 20 post-vaccination . Studying this cohort of animals longitudinally after SIVΔnef vaccination , we demonstrate concomitant coevolution of the virus and the specificity of the CD8 T cell response , resulting in a CD8 T cell repertoire with increased anentropic specificity , wider cumulative breadth , rearranged immunodominance and enhanced depth . \\n The animals included in this study were all female Indian-origin rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta ) , housed in a biocontainment facility at the New England Primate Research Center ( NEPRC ) . These experiments and procedures were approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals . At approval of the study , the assigned protocol number by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee ( IACUC ) was 04383 . The Harvard Medical School animal management program is accredited by the Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care , International ( AAALAC ) , and meets National Institutes of Health standards as set forth in the 8th edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals [27] . The institution also accepts as mandatory the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals by Awardee Institutions and NIH Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing , Research , and Training . There is on file with the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare ( OLAW ) an approved Assurance of Compliance ( A3431-01 ) . All animals were housed indoors in an SOP-driven , AAALAC-accredited facility . Husbandry and care met the guidance of the Animal Welfare Regulations , OLAW reporting and the standards set forth in The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals . All research animals were enrolled in the NEPRC behavioral management program , including an IACUC-approved plan for Environmental Enrichment for research primates . This program included regular behavioral assessments , and provision of species appropriate manipulanda , and foraging opportunities . This protocol had an IACUC-approved exemption from social housing based on scientific justification . Primary enclosures consisted of stainless steel primate caging provided by a commercial vendor . Animal body weights and cage dimensions were regularly monitored . Overall dimensions of primary enclosures ( floor area and height ) met the specifications of The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals , and the Animal Welfare Regulations ( AWR's ) . Further , all primary enclosures were sanitized every 14 days at a minimum , in compliance with AWRs . Secondary enclosures ( room level ) met specifications of The Guide with respect to temperature , humidity , lighting and noise level . The animals were provided ad lib access to municipal source water , offered commercial monkey chow twice daily , and offered fresh produce a minimum of three times weekly . Light cycle was controlled at 12/12 hours daily . The animals were subject to twice daily documented observations by trained animal care and veterinary staff , and enrolled in the facility's environmental enrichment , and preventative health care programs . Euthanasia took place at defined experimental endpoints using protocols consistent with the American Veterinary Medical Association ( AVMA ) guidelines . Animals were first sedated with intramuscular ketamine hydrochloride at 20 mg/kg body followed by sodium pentobarbital ( ≥100 mg/kg ) intravenously to achieve euthanasia . To determine SIV protein-specific T cell responses , 9 whole protein peptide pools were constructed containing 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids at 2 . 5 μg/ml for each . Peptides spanning the SIVmac239 proteome and corresponding to the peptide sequences available from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH , were synthesized by the Massachusetts General Hospital core peptide facility . The sequence of individual peptides can be found at www . aidsreagent . org . For epitope mapping , a three-dimensional peptide matrix was constructed . The matrix was composed of 87 peptide pools , each containing around 27 to 30 peptides . The 87 peptide pools encompassed the entire SIV proteome with a coverage of 3-fold , such that each of the 823 overlapping peptides spanning the SIVmac239 proteome was represented in 3 different pools . The peptides used for epitope mapping were 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids and were obtained from the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program , Division of AIDS , NIAID , NIH . The sequence of individual peptides can be found at www . aidsreagent . org . The entropy for each epitope within SIVmac239 was determined by calculating the entropy of each 9-amino-acid window within SIVmac239 , which was determined by aligning 10 proteomes of SIVsmm , the ancestral virus of both the clonal SIVmac239 and the quasi-species SIVmac251 . The aligned proteome sequences were then uploaded into the Shannon Entropy-One calculator from the Los Alamos National Database ( http://www . hiv . lanl . gov/content/sequence/ENTROPY/entropy_one . html ) . The program calculates an entropy score for each 9 amino acid sequence in the SIVsmm proteome . In order to detect only IFN-γ-producing CD8 T cells , ELISPOT assays were carried out with PBMCs or lymph node mononuclear cells ( LNMC ) after negative selection of CD4 T-lymphocyte populations fractionated by magnetic bead separation ( CD4 Dynabeads; Dynal , Oslo , Norway ) as previously described [20] . Negatively selected CD4 T cells were >90% CD8 T cells . CD4 T cell-depleted PBMC and LNMC were suspended in R-10 medium and used the same day in ELISPOT assays . Isolated lymph node CD4 T cells were pelleted and used for RNA extraction and cell-associated viral RNA quantitation and sequencing . For quantitation of plasma viral loads in SIVΔnef-infected animals , highly specific , real-time RT-PCR assays were performed as described previously [28] . The assay specific for SIVmac239Δnef was developed by designing a reverse primer that uniquely recognizes the sequence generated by the deletion of nef coding sequences in SIVmac239 . The nominal threshold for this assay was 30 viral RNA copy equivalents/ml plasma . To sequence lymph node cell-associated viral RNA , cell-associated viral loads were first determined , incorporating qPCR assay primers and probes for SIV gag , rhesus CCR5 and SIVmac239Δnef as described [28] . Briefly , pelleted cells were rapidly disrupted in 100 μl lysis/digestion solution ( 3M GuHCl , 50 mM TrisCl , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM CaCl2 and 1 mg/ml Proteinase K ) , utilizing a Branson 450 sonifier equipped with a high-intensity cup horn and set at 60% power amplitude ( Branson Ultrasonics , Danbury , CT ) . After continued digestion at 42°C for 1 hour , 400 μl of GuSCN/carrier solution ( ~5 . 7 M GuSCN , 50 mM TrisCl , pH 7 . 6 , 1 mM EDTA , 600 μg/ml glycogen ) was added to completely dissociate RNA-protein complexes . Total nucleic acids were precipitated by addition of 500 μl isopropanol , collected by centrifugation , and washed with 70% ethanol . This precipitate was air-dried , suspended in 60 μl 1X TurboDNAse buffer ( ThermoFisher/Ambion ) , and split into 2 equal 30 μl aliquots for separate RNA and DNA preparation . The samples for DNA determinations were denatured by heating to 100°C for 5 min and quenched on ice prior to qPCR . Associated with determinations of SIVmac239Δnef DNA , cell equivalents based on qPCR for rhesus CCR5 at single haploid copy per genome ( 2 copy equivalents per cell ) were determined on aliquots diluted 1:10 with 5 mM TrisCl , pH 9 . 0 . Copy equivalents of SIVgag and SIVmac239Δnef targets were determined as described [28] . For the aliquots reserved for RNA , 20 μl of a cocktail containing 2 μl ( 4 Units ) TurboDNAseI in 1X buffer ( ThermoFisher/Ambion ) were added to each , and the samples incubated at 42°C for 30 min to digest DNA . After digestion , RNA was recovered by addition of 200 μl of GuSCN solution without glycogen carrier , followed by precipitation with 250 μl isopropanol and a 70% ethanol wash , as noted above . Genome equivalents based on SIV gag or SIVmac239Δnef target sequences were determined as described . The threshold limits of detection for both SIV DNA and SIV RNA were 30 total copies of SIV sequence normalized to calculated cell equivalents . Plasma samples were spun at 14 , 000 rpm at 4°C for 1 hour in a microcentrifuge . Viral RNA was then isolated using the Qiamp MinElute Virus spin kit according to manufacturer’s instructions . Plasma viral RNA and cell-associated viral RNA ( isolated and quantitated as described above ) were reverse transcribed and amplified using 4 sets of primers to produce 4 overlapping amplicons spanning the entire length of the viral coding sequence using the SuperScript III High Fidelity One-Step RT-PCR kit ( Invitrogen , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) . PCR products were either purified with the Qiagen MinElute Gel Extraction ( Qiagen ) kit or Agencourt AMPure XP beads ( Beckman Coulter ) . Samples were quantified with the Quant-IT dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Invitrogen ) The four resultant amplicons were combined and then libraries were created and tagged using the Nextera DNA Sample Prep Kit ( Illumina ) . Individually tagged libraries were quantified with the Quant-IT dsDNA HS Assay kit ( Invitrogen ) and the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . Libraries were then pooled together , denatured with NaOH , and run on an Illumina MiSeq using either a 300 or 500 cycle MiSeq Kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . IFN-γ-producing T-cell responses were enumerated using an enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay for detection of macaque IFN-γ ( Mabtech , Mariemont , OH ) . CD4-depleted PBMC and LN mononuclear cells were stimulated at 2x105 cells per well with peptide pools ( 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 amino acids at 2 . 5 μg/ml each ) . Cells were incubated overnight in multiscreen plates ( Millipore ) coated with an IFN-γ capture antibody , and spots representing IFN-γ-producing T cells were detected in an enzyme-linked , colorimetric assay for bound IFN-γ . Spots were counted using an automated ELISPOT plate reader ( Zellnet Consulting , New York , NY ) . For epitope mapping , peptide-pool-stimulated wells , containing a number of spots 3 times higher than background and greater than 30 spots per million mononuclear cells , were selected for second round deconvolution . To deconvolute peptide-specific CD8 T cell responses , peripheral and lymph node mononuclear cells , depleted of CD4 T cells , were stimulated with single peptides that were present in at least 2 positive pools of the 87 peptide pools . Wells with responses to single peptides 3 times higher than background and greater than 60 spots per million were considered significant . Comprehensive MHC I typing using pyrosequencing was conducted as described [29] . Total cellular RNAs were converted to cDNA using a Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System ( Invitrogen ) . Primary cDNA-PCR amplicons spanning 190 bp of exon two of macaque class I sequences were generated with high-fidelity Phusion polymerase ( New England Biolabs ) . Each PCR primer contained one of 12 distinct 10 bp MID tags along with adaptor sequences for 454 pyrosequencing . After purification , primary amplicons were normalized to equimolar concentrations and groups of 12 animals were pooled for GS FLX analysis . The emulsion PCR and pyrosequencing steps were performed with Genome Sequencer FLX instruments ( Roche/454 Life Sciences ) using GS FLX protocols according to the manufacturer’s specifications ( 454 Life Sciences ) at the 454 Sequencing Center ( Branford , CT ) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign High-Throughput Sequencing Center . Surface staining was carried out by standard procedures for our laboratory as described [30] . Except where noted , all reagents were obtained from BD Biosciences ( San Diego , CA ) and included monoclonal antibodies to the following molecules: CD3 ( clone SP34-2 , APC-Cy7 conjugate ) CD4 ( clone SK3 , PerCP-Cy5 . 5 conjugate ) , CD8α ( clone RPA-T8 , Alexa700 conjugate ) , CD28 ( clone CD28 . 2 , PE-Texas Red conjugate , Beckman-Coulter , Fullerton , CA ) , CCR7 ( clone 150503 , Pacific Blue conjugate , custom ) , KI-67 ( clone EH12 . 2H7 , PE conjugate , custom ) , CD127 ( clone R34 . 34 , PE conjugate , Beckman-Coulter ) , perforin ( clone Pf-344 , FITC conjugate , Mabtech , Mariemont , OH ) . Intracellular staining for perforin and KI-67 expression was performed using Caltag Fix & Perm ( Invitrogen , Camarillo , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol . Enumeration of SIV-specific cells using PE- or APC-conjugated tetramers to Mamu-A*01 Gag181–189CM9 and Tat28–35SL8 ( kindly provided by Nancy Wilson and David Watkins , Wisconsin National Primate Research Center , Madison Wisconsin ) was performed as described previously [31] . All acquisitions were made on an LSR II ( BD Biosciences ) and analyses were done using FlowJo software ( Tree Star Inc . , Ashland , OR ) . Isotype-matched controls and/or fluorescence-minus-one ( FMO ) controls were included in all assays [32] . All statistical analyses were done using GraphPad Prism software ( GraphPad Software v6 . 0b , Inc . , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . Non-parametric Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney tests were used for statistical analysis where the sample size was less than 6 . Otherwise , parametric t tests were conducted; p values less than 0 . 05 were assumed to be significant in all analyses . \\n To study the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response following vaccination with SIVΔnef , we first assessed the extent of viral sequence variation in 12 animals after SIVΔnef infection using next generation sequencing ( NGS ) . The vaccinated animals , most of which displayed classical SIVΔnef viral replication kinetics of peak viremia at week 2 and viral set-points at or near undetectable levels ( <30 copy Eq/ml ) at week 8 , were followed for 20 to 40 weeks before challenge ( Fig . 1A ) . Plasma viral samples from the 12 vaccinated animals were sequenced at time points ranging from 1 week to 34 weeks post-vaccination . RT-PCR was used to create four overlapping amplicons corresponding to the full-length SIV viral genome . Libraries were prepared from the pool of four amplicons and then sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform . Although there was already widespread sequence variation during the first 2 weeks after vaccination with SIVΔnef , none of the variants in any of the animals sequenced exceeded a threshold of 10% ( Figs . 1C and S1 ) , suggesting that these variants were not subject to significant selection in vivo during this initial observation period . However , by week 4 post-vaccination , as the viral load declined from peak viremia , there was a significant increase in the prevalence of nonsynonymous mutations that exceeded the 10% threshold . At this time point , plasma viral RNA samples from 12 animals displayed an average of 8 nonsynonymous mutations , each with a greater frequency than 10% ( Figs . 1C and S2 ) . To determine if sequence variation continued to increase between weeks 4 and 20 , plasma viral RNA was sequenced from the 3 macaques with detectable viremia at week 20 . Plasma viral RNA samples from these 3 animals at week 20 had an average of 28 nonsynonymous mutations with a frequency greater than 10% , a marked increase compared to an average of 8 nonsynonymous mutations at week 4 ( Figs . 1C and S3 ) . To determine the extent of sequence evolution in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals that had lower levels of plasma viremia , we analyzed lymph node CD4 T cell-associated viral RNA at week 20 from 3 animals . Follicular helper CD4 T cells , which are localized in secondary lymphoid tissues , are preferentially infected by SIVΔnef [33] , and therefore have higher cell-associated viral RNA levels than CD4 T cells in peripheral blood [6] . Sequencing of lymph node CD4 T cell-associated viral RNA at week 20 revealed increased viral sequence variation even in SIVΔnef-infected animals with undetectable plasma viremia , albeit at lower levels of variation than observed for viremic animals . Lymph node associated viral RNA sequenced from animals with undetectable plasma viremia had an average of 15 nonsynonymous mutations with a greater frequency than 10% ( Fig . 1D ) , a substantial increase over the 8 nonsynonymous mutations at week 4 for these animals ( S2 Fig . ) . SIVΔnef was longitudinally sequenced in 5 animals , from plasma virus at week 4 and either plasma virus or LN CD4 T cell-associated virus at week 20 . Pooling all the variants ( greater than 10% frequency ) for all 5 animals , the average frequency of nonsynonymous mutations increased from 29% at week 4 to 47% at week 20 ( p = 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Moreover , there was a significant accumulation in the number of nonsynonymous mutations , increasing from an average of 10 nonsynonymous mutations per animal at week 4 to an average of 24 at week 20 ( p = 0 . 031 ) ( Fig . 1E ) . In all animals whose virus was sequenced , there was extensive sequence evolution as measured by the number of nonsynonymous mutations and their frequencies , including in animals with undetectable plasma viral loads . To determine if viral sequence evolution was accompanied by a shift in the epitopes targeted by the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response , we analyzed CD8 T cell responses at weeks 5 and 20 in the 12 vaccinated animals using IFN-γ ELISPOT assays using overlapping peptide pools spanning the entire SIV proteome . In contrast to increased protection between weeks 5 and 20 , there was a 40% decrease in the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) between weeks 5 and 20 ( Fig . 2A ) . Similarly , the breadth of the CD8 T cell response did not correlate with increased protection between weeks 5 and 20 , as the number of positive pools remained stable , with an average of 6 stimulating pools detected at week 5 and an average of 5 . 2 pools detected at week 20 in PBMCs ( Fig . 2B ) . A recent report demonstrated that the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes at week 50 post-vaccination with SIVΔnef correlated with protection against intravenous challenge [6] . To determine if the kinetics of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes ( LN ) correlated with the increased protection observed between weeks 5 and 20 , we looked at the magnitude and the breadth of the SIV-specific CD8+ T cell response in lymph nodes . Similar to the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response observed in peripheral blood , the magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in lymph nodes decreased modestly , by 25% , between weeks 5 and 20 ( Fig . 2C ) . The breadth of the response , as defined by recognition of peptide pools of 30 peptides each , in the lymph nodes was likewise comparable to the breadth of the response in the periphery ( Fig . 2C ) , with a slight decrease from 5 positive pools at week 5 to 4 positive pools at week 20 . We next examined CD8 T cell responses to Gag and Pol , the two most conserved proteins in lentiviruses , as a fraction of total responses to the SIV proteome , an indicator of the level of conservation of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response . Intriguingly , there was a significant enrichment of the ratio of the magnitude of Gag and Pol responses to the total SIV-specific CD8 T cell response between weeks 5 and 20 in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals ( p = <0 . 0001 ) ( Fig . 2D ) . The ratio of Gag and Pol responses to total SIV responses increased in every animal between week 5 and week 20 , increasing from an average of 28% at week 5 to 47% at week 20 . To characterize the shift in CD8 T cell specificity at the level of individual epitopes , we mapped the CD8 T cell response to single peptides for 6 animals at weeks 5 and 20 post-vaccination with SIVΔnef . Epitope mapping of SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses was conducted on CD8 T cells from lymph nodes . For the 2 animals whose SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses were mapped in both lymph nodes and peripheral blood , there was no significant difference in the epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell responses in these two sites ( S1 Table ) . Longitudinal epitope mapping in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals revealed a change in the relative immunodominance of recognized epitopes between weeks 5 and 20 after SIVΔnef vaccination . Furthermore , the specific SIV epitopes recognized by CD8 T cell responses differed significantly between week 5 and week 20 . Of the 36 CD8 T cell epitopes mapped in the 6 animals at week 20 , only 14 were also recognized at week 5 ( Figs . 3A and S4 ) . Almost two thirds of the responses at week 20 are de novo responses or were not readily detectible at week 5 . As a first step in assessing whether these shifts in epitope specificity reflected increased anentropic specificity of the CD8 T cell response , we examined the conservation of targeted epitopes at different times after SIVΔnef vaccination . We assigned every mapped epitope a conservation score by calculating the mean entropy of nine amino acid stretches for all SIV proteins , as determined from the alignment of 10 SIVsmm predicted open reading frames ( Fig . 4 ) . SIVsmm strains were chosen because the virus clone SIVmac239 and the quasispecies SIVmac251 are derived from SIVsmm . Interestingly , in 5 out of 6 animals , the immunodominant response targeted a more conserved epitope ( lower entropy score ) at week 20 than at week 5 ( p = 0 . 039 ) ( Fig . 3B ) . Moreover , 7 of the de novo CD8 T cell responses detected at week 20 targeted highly conserved epitopes with an entropy lower than 0 . 1 . Having established the accumulation of sequence variants between weeks 5 and 20 and a simultaneous shift in the SIV epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell response , we sought to determine whether the two events were causally related . Overlaying epitopes mapped onto the sequenced virus from the 6 animals vaccinated with SIVΔnef demonstrated that there was a high concordance between the occurrence of nonsynonymous mutations and identification of CD8 T cell epitopes . In macaque 225–97 , for which we have the most comprehensive set of viral sequence data and longitudinal epitope mapping , almost all of the nonsynonymous mutations ( 7 out of 9 mutations ) with a frequency greater than 50% fell within a mapped CD8 T cell epitope ( Fig . 5A ) , implying a causal link between CD8 T cell pressure and viral escape . Moreover , the nonsynonymous mutations and mapped epitopes not only overlapped spatially but also overlapped temporally . In animals 225–97 and 256–00 , epitope-specific CD8 T cell responses declined in frequency following escape of the epitope ( Fig . 5B ) . Remarkably , escape epitopes in animal 225–97 were themselves overtaken by other epitope variants over time , suggesting CD8 T cell pressure on the escape epitopes as well ( Fig . 5C ) . However , we did not observe sequence variation in all identified CD8 T cell epitopes . As expected , we observed a strong bias favoring the escape of responses targeting highly variable epitopes , as determined by calculated entropy scores . An analysis of the top four responses mapped for each animal at weeks 5 , 20 and 40 after SIVΔnef vaccination demonstrated that the escaped epitopes had significantly higher entropy scores than targeted epitopes that did not escape ( p = 0 . 0013 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . Similarly , SIV-specific CD8 T cells can be grouped into maintained responses , which target mostly conserved regions , and waning responses that target escaped epitopes . The magnitude of the variable responses , defined as targeting epitopes with an entropy above 0 . 25 , decreased significantly between weeks 5 and 20 ( p = . 0101 ) and between weeks 5 and 40 ( p = . 0449 ) , whereas the magnitude of the conserved responses was maintained ( Fig . 6B ) . To determine if the selective escape of variable epitopes , coupled with the decline of their CD8 T cell response frequencies , led to an immune response that was increasingly focused on more conserved epitopes , we developed a formula that estimates the conservation level of the immune response . The Response Conservation Index is the sum of all SIV-specific CD8 T cell response frequencies , weighted for entropy . The Response Conservation Index was calculated for every animal at both week 5 and 20 using the formula in Fig . 7 . Importantly , in the six animals whose CD8 T cell responses were mapped , the Response Conservation Index increased significantly between weeks 5 and 20 ( p = 0 . 0156 ) ( Fig . 7 ) . To ascertain that the increased targeting of conserved epitopes in the vaccinated animals was not due to a genetic background enriched for protective MHC I molecules , we conducted comprehensive pyrosequencing of MHC I genotypes in the six animals whose CD8 T cell responses were longitudinally mapped . The cohort displayed a diverse set of MHC I molecules with three animals expressing the protective alleles Mamu-A*01 and Mamu-B*17 , while the rest of the animals did not express any protective MHC I alleles ( Table 1 ) . Notably , increased anentropic specificity was documented in every animal between weeks 5 and 20 regardless of the MHC I background ( Fig . 7 ) . The number of epitopes targeted by the CD8 T cell response did not differ between weeks 5 and 20 , as measured by positive peptide pools ( Fig . 2B , 2C ) or the specific mapped epitopes ( Fig . 8A ) . However , we hypothesized that escaped CD8 T cell responses were not deleted but rather maintained as a central memory T cell pool and , therefore , that the cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell repertoire , encompassing all previously detected responses in a given animal , may be a more accurate measure of SIV-specific CD8 T cell breadth ( Fig . 8B ) . Phenotypic analysis of SL8-specific CD8 T cells , targeting the highly mutable SL8 epitope , did reveal a shift to a central memory profile between weeks 5 and 20 , characterized by increased cell surface expression of CD28 ( p = 0 . 0087 ) , CCR7 ( p = 0 . 0006 ) and CD127 ( p<0 . 0001 ) , as well as a decrease in intracellular expression of perforin ( p<0 . 0001 ) and Ki67 ( p = 0 . 0194 ) ( Fig . 8C ) . In Mamu-A1*001+ ( previously known as Mamu-A*01 ) animals , SL8-specific CD8 T cell responses are frequently immunodominant during acute infection but quickly decline following the evolution of escape variants , where 82% and 94% of sequenced SL8 epitopes had mutated as early as week 4 in two SIVΔnef-vaccinated macaques ( Fig . 8D ) . Although SL8-specific CD8 T cells reached nearly undetectable levels by week 20 as measured by IFN-γ ELISPOT and SL8-MHC tetramer staining , the responses rebounded in both animals following challenge with SIVmac251 ( Fig . 8D ) . Given the maintenance of responses to escaped epitopes in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals , all escaped responses were included in the calculation of cumulative breadth . In contrast to CD8 T cell breadth , the cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response increased significantly from an average of 6 responses per animal at week 5 to an average of 10 responses at week 20 ( p = 0 . 0036 ) ( Fig . 8B ) . Finally , SIVΔnef escape , in addition to allowing for anentropic specificity and increased cumulative breadth , contributes to the deepening of the CD8 T cell response . In macaque 256–00 , the mapped Mamu-B17-restricted FW9 ( FHEAVQAVW ) epitope was intact at week 5 but the virus fully escaped by week 20 with 99 . 9% of sequenced reads containing the FW9-H831Y variant . To determine if de novo CD8 T cell responses to the escape variant arose , we tested both variants at week 5 and at the latest time point before challenge , week 38 . Lymph node CD8 T cells from macaque 256–00 recognized FW9 at week 5 but not at week 38; conversely , the FW9-H831Y escape variant was recognized only at week 38 but not at week 5 ( Fig . 9A ) . Similarly , the GY9-K76R epitope variant was recognized at week 38 but not at week 5 demonstrates increased depth of the CD8 T cell response after the escape of the mapped Mamu-A*02-restricted GY9 ( GSENLKSLY ) epitope ( Fig . 9B ) . These data demonstrate that , at least in a subset of SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals , the depth of the CD8 T cell response increased between weeks 5 and 20 as new CD8 T cell responses were mounted against escape variants . \\n Taken together , this data set supports a comprehensive model that provides new insights into the mechanism of SIV-specific immunity maturation after SIVΔnef vaccination . For the first time , we demonstrate that SIVΔnef sequence evolution is widespread after vaccination , not just confined to the previously documented highly mutable epitope of Tat SL8 [26] , and that ongoing sequence evolution occurs even in animals with undetectable plasma viremia . Moreover , we show that the observed sequence evolution can be characterized as viral epitope escape , a consequence of SIV-specific CD8 T cell pressure on the virus as indicated by the many nonsynonymous mutations that appear within mapped CD8 T cell epitopes . Importantly , another direct consequence of immune CTL pressure is the disproportionate escape of highly variable epitopes , which leads to the waning of CD8 T cell responses targeting entropic epitopes and the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses specific for these epitopes . In addition , escaped SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and , as such , contribute to the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 post-vaccination with SIVΔnef . Finally , epitope escape and the ensuing generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to these escape variants constitute a deepening of the CD8 T cell repertoire . Our work sheds new light on SIVΔnef and other LASIV vaccines and how their functional and mechanistic characteristics are fundamentally different from other vaccines . While many of the recent successful replication competent virus vector-based vaccines such as CMV and RRV are also persistent [34–37] , we demonstrate that SIVΔnef is not only a persistent vaccine but that , as a lentivirus , it evolves with the immune response it induces and , ultimately , shapes the CD8 T cell response during the vaccination period . This unique characteristic of SIVΔnef to mutate allows for maturation of CTL specificity through increased targeting of conserved regions , deepening and broadening of the response . Furthermore , this new model accommodates earlier known properties of LASIV , such as the observation that the level of protection of LASIV vaccines inversely correlates with the level of attenuation of the vaccine [6 , 38] . Based on our current work , we hypothesize that LASIV vaccine efficacy depends on virus evolution , resulting in the concurrent CD8 T cell specificity shift from highly variable to conserved regions of the virus . Highly attenuated viruses , such as SIVΔ4 , which exhibits lower efficacy compared to SIVΔnef [38] , would have lower replication rates and less escape events , therefore less opportunity to shape the CD8 T cell response . Despite three decades of HIV research , basic questions of vaccine design remain hotly debated , namely the optimal balance of CD8 T cell response magnitude , breadth and specificity that should be induced by a vaccine . In suggesting that anentropic specificity is a more important correlate of protection in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals than response magnitude , our data corroborates previous work on long-term nonprogressors ( LTNP ) , another important model of spontaneous lentiviral suppression . Research on LTNP has shown that MHC I molecules associated with protection restrict CD8 T cells that target regions within HIV Gag [39 , 40] as well as highly conserved epitopes [41] . However , unlike viral control in LTNP , which is associated with certain protective HLA molecules , we document increased targeting of highly conserved epitopes in all animals regardless of their MHC I genotypic background . Similar to our LASIV-induced protection , viral control in LTNP is correlated with the immunodominance of CD8 T cell responses that target highly conserved epitopes [42] , given that immunodominant CD8 T cells exert more immune pressure [41] . Finally , studies of LTNP revealed the importance of targeting conserved regions during acute infection [41] , before massive depletion of CD4 T cells has occurred [43] . Our research demonstrates that at week 20 , whereas responses to variable regions have waned , the immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells target more conserved epitopes than at week 5 . The presence of immunodominant CD8 T cells exerting pressure on highly conserved regions during acute infection in animals challenged at week 20 post-vaccination , but not at week 5 , could explain the observed difference in protection . Conversely , the absence of immunodominant responses targeting highly conserved regions in animals challenged at week 5 allows the virus to easily escape and the accumulation of anentropic-specific CD8 T cell responses would occur long after acute infection , if at all . In addition to immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells with anentropic specificity , we also show increased cumulative breadth and depth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 compared to week 5 . The increased cumulative breadth at week 20 is a function of waning escaped CD8 T cell responses that are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and are recalled upon challenge . It is unclear how effective these responses are at long-term viral suppression , given that they have been escaped and mostly target variable regions of the virus . Still , a recent report suggests that acute-phase SIV-specific CD8 T cells targeting variable regions are important for viral control [44] , indicating that the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 may also contribute to protection . Moreover , we detected de novo CD8 T cell responses specific to escaped epitope variants , illustrating that viral escape also contributes to increased immune response depth . Although LTNP generate HIV-specific CD8 T cells that cross-react with escape mutants [45] , the generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to escaped epitopes is rarely observed in adults infected with HIV [46] . In animal 256–00 , we identified two such CD8 T cell responses that target variant epitopes at week 38 but were not detectable at week 5 . We only assayed CD8 T cell responses against escape variants of known CD8 T cell epitopes with known MHC I restriction , and only if the MHC I is expressed by the infected animal . The relative frequency of de novo CD8 T cell responses in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals , if verified in future studies , could be due to an intact CD4 T cell compartment that persists well into the chronic phase of LASIV infection . Previous reports have documented rapid escape of variable epitopes during acute HIV-1 infection and maintenance of CD8 T cell responses specific for conserved epitopes into chronic infection [47–49] . Here , in the context of SIVΔnef , we demonstrate , in addition to rapid escape of variable epitopes and maintenance of existing CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity , de novo CD8 T cell responses against novel epitopes and escape variants during chronic infection . Furthermore , we correlate the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity and the increased repertoire depth and breadth to the kinetics of SIVΔnef vaccine-induced protection . Previous research on the coevolution of lentiviral epitopes and the CD8 T cell response has been conducted in the setting of wild-type infection , and it is unclear that our findings of increased anentropic specificity , cumulative breadth and repertoire depth during SIVΔnef vaccination would apply to wild-type lentiviral infection , in which the CD8 T cell response is likely to be impaired by the persistently high antigenic load , CD4 T cell depletion in the gut and microbial translocation-induced immune activation . Notably , we did not see an increased magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in the lymph nodes between weeks 5 and 20 . Fukazawa and colleagues [6] have recently shown that less attenuated LASIVs such as SIVΔnef have higher viral replication in the lymph nodes and , in turn , have higher lymph node CD8 T cell responses . Although these results corroborate existing data demonstrating that protection inversely correlates with LASIV attenuation [38] , our data demonstrates that the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response does not correlate with the kinetics of protection , neither in the PBMC nor lymph node compartment . Although our current work supports the importance of conserved responses as a correlate for protection , others have shown that using conserved regions as immunogens may result in a reduction of the total magnitude of responses [50] . It is unknown whether vaccines inducing targeted responses toward conserved regions will make up for the loss of magnitude . Still it is encouraging that we observe increased anentropic specificity in all animals , suggesting that even nonprotective MHC I molecules can target highly conserved epitopes if properly primed . It has also been proposed that the increased protection of LASIV vaccines is due to phenotypic maturation of the CD8 T cell response . It is important to delineate whether observed phenotypic changes in SIV-specific CD8 T cells correlate with LASIV protection and whether CD8 T cell phenotypic maturation is specific to LASIV or can be seen in other vaccines , such as adenovirus- , CMV- and RRV-based SIV vaccines . Finally , although this data set was focused on the CD8 T cell response and its evolution over time post-vaccination , we observed relatively few nonsynonymous mutations in env outside of mapped CD8 T cell epitopes , suggesting that antibody responses induced only modest immune selective pressure on SIVΔnef compared to CD8 T cell responses . Although immunodominance , specificity , breadth and depth have been implicated for some time as determinants of a successful CD8 T cell response against HIV/SIV infection , these results demonstrate how such a CD8 T cell response may be induced by the highly protective SIVΔnef vaccine . This new model of SIVΔnef-mediated protection raises obvious implications for vaccine design , namely that a successful vaccine should focus CD8 T cell responses on conserved regions of the virus and their existing variants . The recent success of viral vectors such as CMV [34–36] , RRV [37] , and adenovirus [51] to elicit potent CD8 T cell responses that partially protect rhesus macaques from infection has been an important step forward in vaccine design . However , these vaccines are all derived from DNA viruses , which have significantly lower rates of mutation than lentiviruses , and thus they are unlikely to shape the immune response in a similar fashion to SIVΔnef . Our work suggests that immunogens should be carefully chosen for these vectors such that the induced responses preferentially target conserved regions of the virus , as well as existing variants of these regions to increase response breadth and depth simultaneously .   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Mucosal infections with Candida albicans belong to the most frequent forms of fungal diseases . Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease . \\n The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans has emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide , particularly in immunocompromised individuals [1] . Of the diverse forms of disease manifestations , mucosal infections with C . albicans are by far most abundant [2] . The symptoms reach from mild forms of infection to chronic or recurrent diseases . No licensed fungal vaccines are currently available to prevent disease , and toxicity and resistance to available drugs compromise the effective management of patients . With the ever-increasing population of immunocompromised patients , C . albicans infections thus represent an important socio-economic challenge worldwide . The epithelium constitutes the first point of contact between the fungus and the host [3] . It provides an important physical barrier to prevent fungal invasion . Moreover , it has the capacity to sense and respond to the fungus . By producing inflammatory mediators and antifungal defense molecules the epithelium actively participates in the host response and together with leukocytes , including neutrophils and IL-17-producing lymphocytes , contributes to limiting fungal ( over ) growth . Diverse mutual interactions between leukocytes and the epithelium are critical for mounting a broadly protective response against C . albicans . The epithelium elicits signals in response to the fungus that can promote the inflammatory response [3] , while cytokines such as IL-17 , produced by leukocytes , act on the epithelium to enhance its barrier function and antimicrobial activity [4 , 5] . Neutrophils have been shown to rapidly accumulate in the oral mucosa in response to C . albicans infection , and they critically contribute to prevent invasion of the fungus in underlying tissues and dissemination to the circulation and visceral organs as was shown in a model of acute oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) [6 , 7] . The relevance of neutrophils in protection from oropharyngeal candidiasis is also evidenced by the high incidence of the disease in hemato-oncological patients with bone marrow aplasia [8 , 9] . Neutrophils comprise a major proportion of circulating peripheral blood leukocytes . They are generated from granulocyte-macrophage progenitors in the bone marrow under the control of granulopoietic growth factors , primarily granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) [10] . During acute infection , granulopoiesis is massively enhanced to comply with the increased demand for neutrophils in host defense [11] . Control mechanisms of this demand-adapted hematopoiesis involve long-distance regulatory feedback loops induced at the site of infection where neutrophils act , which is usually distant from the production site of neutrophils in the bone marrow . Increased release of G-CSF in response to infectious and/or inflammatory insult plays a key role in this process [11] . Given the potentially harmful effects of dysregulated neutrophils , granulopoiesis and neutrophil trafficking is under tight control and regulated in a tissue-specific manner [12] . With the discovery of interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) and the realization of its critical role in defense against mucocutaneous candidiasis [5 , 13] , it was postulated that IL-17 mediates protection by promoting the neutrophil response . Indeed , IL-17 signaling can enhance expression of neutrophil cytopoietic and chemotactic factors in response to C . albicans [14] . However , we recently demonstrated that neutrophils are recruited normally to the site of infection in IL-17 receptor-deficient mice , thus that the IL-17 pathway is not required for the neutrophil response during OPC [6] . Therefore , although neutrophil trafficking may be regulated by IL-17 in some tissues and in response to certain pathogens [15–19]—this is not the case during C . albicans infection in the oral mucosa . Alternative candidate factors regulating the neutrophil response include IL-1 . In fact , secretion of both IL-1α and IL-1β are efficiently induced in dendritic cells and macrophages when stimulated with C . albicans [20–23] and both IL-1 family members were shown to contribute to protection from systemic infection [24] . Epithelial cells also secrete IL-1 cytokines when triggered with C . albicans [25–27] , although in mice , unlike in humans , keratinocytes produce only IL-1α but no IL-1β [28] . Whether and how IL-1 cytokines contribute to antifungal defense in barrier tissues remains poorly defined . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis , we found that IL-1R signaling is critical for host defense by regulating the neutrophil response . We show here that IL-1 acts by two complementary mechanisms . First , it regulates the production of neutrophil-chemotactic factors by epithelial cells for the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulating pool to the site of infection . Second , it induces G-CSF production by the endothelium for enhanced neutrophil output from the bone marrow to meet the increased demand in response to infection . Release of IL-1α from keratinocytes upon contact with C . albicans is critical for mediating this crosstalk between the epithelium and the endothelium in the oral mucosa . \\n Infection of mice with C . albicans via the oropharyngeal route induces a rapid inflammatory response , characterized by a massive recruitment of neutrophils to the oral mucosa ( Fig 1A , S1 Fig ) [6 , 7 , 29] , which accumulate in proximity to where C . albicans hyphae invade the keratinocyte barrier on the dorsal and ventral side of the tongue [6] . Following from our previous findings that neutrophil trafficking during OPC was independent of the IL-17 pathway [6] , we sought after factors responsible for controlling neutrophil recruitment in response to C . albicans . We found that mice lacking the IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) recruited significantly less neutrophils to the site of infection than their wild type ( WT ) counterparts ( Fig 1B ) . In consequence Il1r1-/- mice were unable to control the fungus and displayed an increased fungal load in the tongue on day 3 post-infection ( Fig 1C ) . These data indicated clearly that IL-1R signaling was critical for the neutrophil response during OPC . The rapid accumulation of neutrophils in the oral mucosa of infected mice was paralleled by a strong induction of the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines CXCL1 , CXCL2 and CXCL5 ( Fig 2A ) . Consistent with the role of IL-1 in neutrophil recruitment , chemokine expression in the oral epithelium was impaired in absence of IL-1R signaling ( Fig 2B ) , while basal levels were comparable ( S2 Fig ) . To determine the cellular compartment responsible for chemokine production , we sorted cellular subsets from the tongue of naïve and C . albicans-infected mice on day 1 post-infection , the peak of the neutrophil response , including CD45+ leukocytes , CD45- EpCAM+ CD31- keratinocytes and CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ endothelial cells ( S3 Fig ) and analyzed chemokine expression at the transcriptional level . The keratinocyte fraction displayed the highest RNA levels , and the induction in response to infection was most prominent in this population ( Fig 2C ) . Consistent with this result , a cell line of tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) also secreted neutrophil-attracting chemokines in an IL-1-dependent manner in vitro ( Fig 2D ) . These data suggested that the neutrophil response to OPC is initiated locally in the infected mucosa . While C . albicans may directly induce chemokine expression in keratinocytes , their production is strongly enhanced by IL-1R signaling . In addition to the strong induction of the neutrophil-recruiting chemokines during OPC , the expression of Csf3 , the gene coding for G-CSF , was also markedly induced in the infected oral mucosa ( Fig 3A ) , suggesting that it may contribute to the overall neutrophil response during OPC by boosting granulopoiesis and neutrophil egress from the bone marrow . We therefore analyzed typical surrogate hallmarks of emergency granulopoiesis in the bone marrow . While total numbers of CD45+ cells in the bone marrow were unchanged in infected mice compared to naïve controls ( Fig 3B ) , we observed a reduction in mature Ly6Ghi CD11b+ Ly6Cint neutrophils ( Fig 3C and 3D ) . This response was paralleled by an increase in Ly6Glo CD11b+ Ly6C- immature neutrophils ( Fig 3C and 3E ) . These reciprocal changes in mature and immature neutrophils in the bone marrow indicated that G-CSF , which was induced by the local infection with C . albicans , acted at a distance and thereby elicited a systemic response . Indeed , neutralization of G-CSF impaired the induction of emergency granulopoiesis during infection ( Fig 3F and 3G ) . The increased demand for neutrophils in the infected tissue was thus compensated by an increased rate of granulopoiesis and mobilization of neutrophils from the bone marrow . The increased neutrophil output from the bone marrow was relevant for the local antifungal response as indicated by the fact that depletion of the circulating neutrophil pool with an anti-Ly6G-specific antibody ( 1A8 ) was not sufficient to blunt the neutrophil response to C . albicans [6] . Instead , the combination of anti-Ly6G and anti-G-CSF was required for efficient depletion of neutrophils in the blood and in the infected tissue ( Fig 3H and 3I ) resulting in a total loss of fungal control ( Fig 3J ) . Note that the reduction of neutrophils by ~1 log ( Fig 3I ) resulted in a ~4-log increase in fungal load over a course of 3 days ( Fig 3J ) , while the ~0 . 5 log reduction in neutrophils in absence of IL-1 signaling ( Fig 1B ) lead to a ~2-log increase in fungal load over the same period of time ( Fig 1C ) . Given the prominent role of G-CSF for the overall neutrophil response during OPC we wanted to understand the regulation of this growth factor in more detail . For this , we isolated again CD45+ leukocytes , CD45- EpCAM+ CD31- keratinocytes , and CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ endothelial cells from the tongue of C . albicans-infected mice and uninfected controls as above ( S3 Fig ) and analyzed Csf3 transcript levels in each population . Surprisingly , the most prominent expression was observed in the endothelial cell population ( Fig 4A ) . Although keratinocytes were previously shown to secrete G-CSF in response to C . albicans in vitro [26] , their contribution in vivo was minor ( Fig 4A ) . Similarly , leukocytes expressed only very low levels of G-CSF during OPC ( Fig 4A ) . To corroborate this unexpected finding , we examined G-CSF protein production by the different cell subsets . Because we were unable to visualize intracellular G-CSF by flow cytometry , we prepared cell lysates from sort-purified tongue cell populations and quantified their G-CSF content by ELISA . Again , by far the highest production of G-CSF was detected in the endothelial cell fraction isolated from infected mice ( Fig 4B ) . Further separation of the CD45- EpCAM- CD31+ population in podoplanin-positive and podoplanin-negative subsets confirmed that blood endothelial cells rather than lymph endothelial cells were responsible for G-CSF production during OPC ( S4 Fig ) . Production of G-CSF by endothelial cells was supported by the observation that high levels of G-CSF could be detected in the serum of infected mice ( Fig 4C ) . Together , these data suggested that G-CSF , which is induced in response to local infection with C . albicans , acts at a distance to promote granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization in the bone marrow and thereby sustains a systemic neutrophil response that meets the increased demand of these cells during OPC . Next , we investigated how G-CSF secretion by endothelial cells is regulated during OPC . Direct stimulation of endothelial cells by C . albicans appeared unlikely given their spatial distribution in the oral mucosa . We made use of VE-cadherin-cre x ROSA26-RFP reporter mice [30] to visualize the blood and lymphatic vessels in situ and infected them with GFP-expressing C . albicans ( Fig 5A ) . In immunocompetent animals , fungal hyphae were restricted to the avascular tongue epithelium without penetrating the basal epithelial layers . The absence of direct contacts of C . albicans with endothelial cells suggested that G-CSF production was regulated indirectly . Given the important role of IL-1 for the overall neutrophil response to C . albicans , we assessed the IL-1 dependence of G-CSF during OPC . The induction of Csf3 transcripts was less pronounced in the oral mucosa of Il1r1-/- mice ( Fig 5B ) , while basal levels were unchanged ( S2 Fig ) . Likewise , G-CSF protein expression by endothelial cells that were sorted from infected tongues was drastically diminished in absence of IL-1R signaling ( Fig 5C ) . This translated in strongly diminished G-CSF levels in the serum of C . albicans-infected Il1r1-/- mice compared to WT controls ( Fig 5D ) . In contrast , TNF , which had been proposed to regulate G-CSF expression in vitro [31] , was not involved in G-CSF production during OPC ( S5 Fig ) . As a consequence of the G-CSF defect in Il1r1-/- mice , emergency granulopoiesis was strongly impaired during OPC in these mice , as indicated by the higher ratio of mature to immature neutrophils in the bone marrow of infected Il1r1-/- mice compared to WT controls ( Fig 5E and 5F ) . Importantly , Il1r1-/- mice responded to G-CSF treatment , and the administration of recombinant G-CSF was sufficient to fully overcome the defect in emergency granulopoiesis in these mice ( Fig 5G and 5H ) . Together , these data demonstrated , that G-CSF secretion during OPC was controlled by the IL-1 pathway . G-CSF production appeared to underlie a different regulatory mechanism compared to neutrophil chemokine production during OPC given their distinct cellular sources , despite the fact that both , chemokines and G-CSF , depended on IL-1R signaling . Next , we examined the expression of IL-1α and IL-1β , the two activating ligands of the IL-1R . Both were found strongly induced during OPC ( Fig 6A ) . IL-1α and IL-1β contribute to G-CSF production during OPC because the induction of G-CSF expression in the oral mucosa and its release into the serum were strongly impaired in absence of IL-1α or IL-1β ( Fig 6B and 6C ) . IL-1β was expressed predominantly by the hematopoietic compartment as assessed by flow cytometric analysis of intracellular pro-IL-1β ( S6 Fig ) . To determine the cellular source of IL-1α in the murine tongue , we applied an immunofluorescence approach , which allowed us to detect IL-1α with high specificity on tissue sections . Basal expression levels observed in the keratinized epithelium of the tongue in naïve mice were strongly enhanced upon infection ( Fig 6D ) . Co-staining with antibodies specific for keratinocytes of the tongue ( keratin-6 ) or those of stratum basale ( keratin-14 ) [32] revealed that IL-1α was predominantly produced by differentiated keratinocytes ( Fig 6E ) . Note that the IL-1α signal was absent in neutrophil-rich areas , which were identified by DAPI staining . The availability of preformed IL-1α ( but not IL-1β ) protein in steady-state ( Fig 6D , S6 Fig ) , which can be rapidly released in response to stimulation , together with the strategic position of keratinocytes as the first contact point between the host and the infecting fungus , suggested that keratinocyte-derived IL-1α likely functions as an ‘alarmin’ right at the onset of infection to alert the host about fungal invasion and to initiate a protective antifungal response . As such , keratinocyte-derived IL-1α may also act on endothelial cells and thereby contribute to the neutrophil response during OPC . To delineate the putative crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells in more detail , we made use of a newly generated cell line of mouse tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) ( S7 Fig ) . TDKs expressed high levels of EpCAM and keratin-6 indicating that they represented differentiated oral keratinocytes [32] . Their concurrent expression of keratin-14 was consistent with their origin of basal keratinocytes with stem cell properties . Consistent with published data with keratinocytes from other sources [26] , TDKs released IL-1α when stimulated with C . albicans ( Fig 7A ) . Notably , and in contrast to human keratinocytes [28] , mouse keratinocytes released no IL-1β ( Fig 7B ) . This response was dependent on live and hyphenating fungus because heat-killed or a yeast-locked C . albicans did not induce IL-1α ( Fig 7C ) . Likewise , IL-1α was not induced with zymosan , a yeast cell wall extract , or curdlan , a pure β-glucan preparation ( Fig 7A ) . Consistent with our in vivo data , the overall amount of IL-1α detected from TDKs in response to live C . albicans resulted from the release of preformed cytokine and de novo biosynthesis of IL-1α ( Fig 7D ) . Next , we tested the effect of TDKs and TDK-derived IL-1α on endothelial cells for G-CSF induction ( Fig 8A ) . For this , we employed an established endothelial cell line , MS1 [33] . TDKs and MS1 cells both did not produce G-CSF when directly stimulated with C . albicans nor with curdlan or zymosan , although they responded strongly to LPS , which was included as a positive control ( Fig 8B and 8C ) . However , MS1 cells secreted high amounts of G-CSF when stimulated with the sterile-filtered supernatant of C . albicans-stimulated TDKs ( Fig 8D ) . This response was dose-dependent ( Fig 8E ) and only observed when TDKs were stimulated with life and hyphenating C . albicans , but not with heat-killed C . albicans , a yeast-locked strain of C . albicans or inert fungal cell wall components such as zymosan and β-glucan ( curdlan ) ( Fig 8D–8F ) . Similar results were obtained when supernatant of freshly isolated mouse oral keratinocytes stimulated with C . albicans was added to MS1 cells ( S8 Fig ) . This indicated that a C . albicans-induced TDK-derived soluble factor was responsible for G-CSF production by endothelial cells . To test whether this factor was IL-1α , we added anakinra ( IL-1R antagonist ) or a neutralizing anti-IL-1α antibody into the supernatant-transfer assay . This resulted in a complete abolishment of the response ( Fig 8G–8I ) , while adding an anti-IL-1β antibody had no effect on G-CSF induction by TDK-derived factors ( Fig 8I ) , consistent with the notion that IL-1β was not produced by murine keratinocytes ( Fig 7B ) . IL-1α was not only necessary but also sufficient for triggering G-CSF production in endothelial cells , because MS1 cells secreted large quantities of G-CSF when stimulated with recombinant IL-1α ( Fig 8J ) . In summary , these results revealed a novel IL-1α-dependent crosstalk between epithelial and endothelial cells that mediates the induction of G-CSF by C . albicans . In conclusion , our data corroborate the notion that the epithelium takes an active part in host defense in barrier tissue through its strategic location and by alerting the immune system about the presence of a pathogenic threat . By demonstrating the relevance of IL-1α release ( for G-CSF induction ) and chemokine secretion , we provided an example in a physiologically relevant system . \\n In this study , we describe an essential function of the IL-1 pathway in antifungal immunity in the murine oral mucosa . We demonstrated how IL-1R signaling regulates the neutrophil response against C . albicans in two ways to prevent fungal growth and dissemination . Specifically , it promotes the production of chemokines by oral keratinocytes for neutrophil recruitment from the circulating pool , and it induces G-CSF secretion from endothelial cells to enhance granulopoiesis in the bone marrow to meet the rapid demand for neutrophils in the tissue . IL-1R signaling thereby translates the local response to a tissue-specific infection into a systemic response . The availability of preformed IL-1α from keratinocytes , which are the first cells to be exposed to C . albicans during infection , is critical for the initiation of the response . Together , our data demonstrate how signaling through the IL-1R coordinates a cellular crosstalk between keratinocytes , endothelial cells and neutrophils for optimal control of C . albicans in the oral mucosa . Rapid infiltration of neutrophils to the site of infection is a hallmark of the inflammatory response to OPC and critical for the confinement of the fungus in the mucosal epithelium [6] . The neutrophil response in the oral mucosa was originally thought to be controlled by the IL-17 pathway , which itself is highly critical for fungal control during OPC [14] . However , previous work from our laboratory showed that the key protective function of IL-17 is uncoupled from the neutrophil response [6] . Although IL-17 signaling can enhance the expression of neutrophil chemokines and granulopoietic factors [14] , IL-17 is not required for neutrophil chemotaxis and function during OPC [6] . Instead , neutrophil trafficking to the oral mucosa during acute infection is under the control of IL-1R signaling as our data demonstrate . IL-1R deficiency is associated with impaired neutrophil recruitment and defective fungal control in response to OPC . Our data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating a role for IL-1R signaling in antifungal defense in different settings including systemic candidiasis [24] , a model of mixed oral and systemic candidiasis [34] , A . fumigatus keratitis [35] and invasive pulmonary aspergillosis [36] . The mechanism of IL-1R-mediated protection , however , was not addressed in most of these studies . Here , we used the model of OPC to dissect the impact of IL-1R signaling on neutrophil mobilization and recruitment in response to C . albicans infection at a cellular and molecular level . Keratinocytes take center stage in the coordination of the IL-1-mediated neutrophil response during OPC . They act as the major producers of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines . Chemokine production by keratinocytes was greatly enhanced by IL-1R signaling and at least in part through the autocrine activity of IL-1α . A similar mechanism for enhanced chemokine secretion by keratinocytes was described before in the context of Staphylococcus aureus skin infection [37] . A second mechanism , by which keratinocytes promote the neutrophil response during OPC , is by the induction of G-CSF via their capacity to produce IL-1α . Our data thus link IL-1 signaling and G-CSF production . G-CSF regulates granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization in the bone marrow , which is critical to meet the rapidly increasing demand of neutrophils in the infected tissue . Administration of recombinant G-CSF in mice is sufficient to drive emergency granulopoiesis as we and others have shown [38] , and recombinant G-CSF is widely used therapeutically to treat neutropenia [39] . G-CSF has also been used successfully in the treatment of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis [40] . Besides its host-beneficial role in hematopoiesis and protection from infection , dysregulated production of G-CSF has been linked to autoinflammatory disorders such as psoriasis and inflammatory arthritis [41–43] and targeting G-CSF has been proposed as a therapeutic approach against these diseases [44] . We identified endothelial cells in the oral tissue to be the major producers of G-CSF during OPC , while we were unable to detect G-CSF expression by murine keratinocytes in response to C . albicans . Direct secretion of G-CSF into the bloodstream by endothelial cells facilitates its delivery to the distant bone marrow and the induction of a systemic response . During systemic bacterial infections , G-CSF production by the endothelium was shown to be a direct and TLR4-dependent response of the vasculature to endotoxin stimulation which lead to the induction of emergency granulopoiesis [38] . During OPC , we found no evidence for direct response of the endothelium to C . albicans , and endothelial cells were not activated by the fungus in vitro . Instead , G-CSF was produced as a result of an IL-1-dependent crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells . IL-1α was critical for the secretion of G-CSF into the circulation during OPC , and it was sufficient for stimulating G-CSF production by endothelial cells in culture , consistent with a published report [31] . In contrast , TNF , which was also reported to induce G-CSF production by endothelial cells in vitro [31] , did not regulate G-CSF production during OPC . In addition to IL-1α , IL-1β also contributes to the antifungal response in vivo and at least partially compensates in absence of IL-1α . IL-1β was also induced in the oral mucosa during infection . Consistent with the notion that murine keratinocytes are unable to produce IL-1β [28] , we found this cytokine to be expressed by the hematopoietic compartment . IL-1β induction in response to C . albicans was shown previously to depend on the NLRP3 inflammasome in different infection models [21 , 34 , 45] and NLRP3 was required in the hematopoietic compartment [29] . In addition to the NLRP3 inflammasome , the NLRC4 inflammasome was also shown to contribute to protection from OPC [29] . Whether its function at the level of the mucosal stroma is linked to the IL-1 pathway and whether it is involved in IL-1α production in keratinocytes was not addressed . We found that the overall IL-1α response resulted from the release of preformed and intracellularly stored IL-1α on the one hand , and from the induction of de novo synthesis on the other hand . The release of IL-1α from keratinocytes correlates with the induction of cell damage [46] , suggesting that IL-1α release may be a consequence of cell death induced by fungal invasion . It remains to be determined whether IL-1α secretion by oral keratinocytes in response to C . albicans infection depends on caspase-1 as was shown to be the case for bone marrow-derived MNPs differentiated with GM-CSF [20] . The dependence of IL-1α secretion on life and filamenting fungus is consistent with the implication of candidalysin in this process . This fungal peptide toxin has recently been identified as a critical virulence factor promoting epithelial cell damage and the release of cytoplasmic molecules , some of which may act as alarmins [47] . Importantly , our data demonstrate the biological relevance of keratinocyte-derived factors induced by C . albicans for the induction of inflammation and protection from infection in vivo , and they dissect the mechanism how IL-1 coordinates the neutrophil response against the fungus in the oral epithelium . \\n All mouse experiments described in this study were conducted in strict accordance with the guidelines of the Swiss Animal Protection Law and were performed under protocols approved by the Veterinary office of the Canton Zurich , Switzerland ( license number 201/2012 and 183/2015 ) . All efforts were made to minimize suffering and ensure the highest ethical and humane standards . WT C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Janvier Elevage . Il1a-/- mice ( a kind gift from Manfred Kopf ) [48] , Il1b-/- mice [48] ( a kind gift from Manfred Kopf and Hans-Dietmar Beer ) and Il1r1-/- mice [49] were bred at the Laboratory Animal Service Center ( University of Zürich , Switzerland ) . VE-cadherin-cre x ROSA26-RFP reporter mice [30] and Tnf-/- mice ( a kind gift from Annette Oxenius ) [50] were bred at the Rodent Center HCI at ETH Zürich . All mice were on the C57BL/6 background , kept in specific pathogen-free conditions and used at 6–15 weeks of age . For neutrophil depletion , mice were treated with anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 , BioXCell , 150μg per mouse i . p . on day -1 ) and/or anti-G-CSF ( clone 67604 , R&D Systems , 10μg per mouse per day i . p . starting from day -1 ) , as indicated . For inhibition of emergency granulopoiesis , mice were treated with anti-G-CSF ( 10μg per mouse per day i . p . on day -1 and day 0 ) . For induction of emergency granulopoiesis , mice were injected with human recombinant G-CSF ( Filgrastim , Amgen , 5 μg/mouse i . p . at 5h and 17h post-infection ) . The C . albicans strain SC5314 was used for all experiments except where stated otherwise . The yeast-locked strain hgc1Δ/Δ and its revertant hgc1Δ/Δ:HGC1 [51] were obtained from N . Gow ( Aberdeen ) . The strain pACT1-GFP [52] was obtained from C . Reis e Sousa . All strains were grown in YPD medium at 30°C for 15–18 hours . Mice were infected with 2 . 5x106 cfu C . albicans sublingually as described [53] without immunosuppression . Mice were monitored for morbidity and euthanized in case they showed severe signs of pain or distress . For determination of fungal burden , the tongue of euthanized animals was removed , homogenized in sterile 0 . 05% NP40 in H2O for 3 minutes at 25 Hz using a Tissue Lyzer ( Qiagen ) and serial dilutions were plated on YPD agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin . The detection limit corresponds to one colony divided by the mean weight of the tongues in the experiment . For heat-killing 108 yeast cells were boiled for 45 minutes . Preformed hyphae were generated in keratinocyte medium at 37°C , 5% CO2 for 24 hours . Mice were anaesthetized with a sublethal dose of Ketamine ( 100 mg/kg ) , Xylazin ( 20 mg/kg ) and Acepromazin ( 2 . 9 mg/kg ) , and perfused by injection of PBS into the right heart ventricle prior to removing the tongue and/or the bones . Tongues were cut into fine pieces and digested with DNase I ( 200 μg/ml , Roche ) and Collagenase IV ( 4 . 8 mg/ml , Invitrogen ) in PBS at 37°C for 45–60 minutes . Single cell suspensions were passed through a 70 μm strainer using ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS and 2 mM EDTA and analyzed by flow cytometry ( see below ) . For intracellular cytokine staining , tongue leukocytes were enriched over a 40% percoll gradient before antibody staining and analysis . Bone marrow was flushed from femurs using PBS and passed through a 70 μm strainer using ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS and 2mM EDTA . Erythrocytes were lyzed using erythrocyte lysis buffer ( 0 . 3 M NH4Cl , 28 μM NaHCO3 , 125 μM EDTA ) , and leukocytes were analyzed by flow cytometry . Tongue-derived keratinocytes ( TDKs ) were obtained from WT mice . The tongue was cut to obtain ventral and dorsal parts . The dorsal part of the tongue was freed from muscle tissue with a scalpel and floated on DMEM ( PAA ) containing 0 . 8% trypsin ( Thermo Fischer ) for 40 minutes with the epithelial side facing upwards . After incubation , the epithelial tissue was separated from the lamina propria , and keratinocytes were isolated by incubating in DMEM medium containing DNase I ( Roche , 200 μg/ml ) for 30 minutes and occasional vortexing and filtering through a 70 μm strainer . The cells were pelleted , resuspended in keratinocyte medium ( S1 Table , adapted from [54] ) and cultivated in cell culture plates coated with collagen ( Bornstein and Traub Type IV , Sigma Aldrich , 25μg/ml ) . The blood endothelial cell line MS1 [33] was kept in DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FCS and Penicillin/Streptomycin . Prior to stimulation experiments , TDK and MS1 cells were rested for 48 hours and then stimulated with recombinant IL-1α ( Peprotech , 20 ng/ml ) , IL-1β ( Peprotech , 20 ng/ml ) , anakinra ( 250 μg/ml ) , zymosan ( 20 μg/ml ) , curdlan ( 200 μg/ml ) , LPS ( 100 ng/ml ) or C . albicans at MOI = 3 for 24 hours . Amphotericin B was added 8 hours post-stimulation where stated explicitly . Supernatants were collected for analysis . In some cases , cell lysates were generated by adding 0 . 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS to the supernatant-free cells . To determine the total amount of IL-1α in cells and supernatant , Triton-X 100 was added to separate culture wells at a final concentration of 0 . 1% . For supernatant transfer experiments , TDKs were stimulated for 24 hours as described , supernatants were removed , sterile-filtered and added to MS1 cells at a 1:3 dilution . G-CSF production by MS1 cells was determined by ELISA after 24 hours ( see below ) . In some experiments , TDK supernatants were treated with anti-IL-1α ( clone ALF-161 , BioXCell , 20 μg/ml ) and/or anti-IL-1β ( clone B122 , BioXCell , 20 μg/ml ) before they were added to MS1 cells , or MS1 cells were pretreated with anakinra for 30 minutes before addition of TDK supernatant . All antibodies were from BioLegend , if not stated otherwise . For flow cytometry analyses of neutrophils , single cell suspensions of tongues , bone marrow or blood were stained in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS , 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02% NaN3 with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain ( Life Technologies ) , anti-CD45 . 2 ( clone 104 ) , anti-CD11b ( clone M1/70 ) , anti-Ly6C ( clone AL-21 , BD Biosciences ) and anti-Ly6G ( clone 1A8 ) . For flow cytometry analyses of tongue keratinocytes and endothelial cells , single cell suspensions were stained in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1% FCS , 5 mM EDTA , and 0 . 02% NaN3 , with LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain or 7AAD ( BD Pharmingen ) , anti-CD45 . 2 ( clone 104 ) , anti-EpCAM ( clone G8 . 8 ) and anti-CD31 ( clone MEC13 . 3 ) . In some experiments , anti-podoplanin ( clone 8 . 1 . 1 ) was included . For intracellular cytokine staining , tongue cells were first incubated in LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near-IR Stain and surface marker antibodies . After fixation and permeabilization using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm ( BD Biosciences ) the cells were incubated in Perm/Wash buffer ( BD Biosciences ) containing anti-pro-IL-1β ( clone NJTEN3 ) or the respective isotype control antibody . Cells were acquired on a FACS LSRII ( BD Biosciences ) or on a FACS Gallios ( Becton Coulter ) , and data were analyzed with FlowJo software ( Tristar ) . For all experiments , the data were pre-gated on live single cells . For isolating tongue cell subsets by FACS sorting , single cell suspensions of five tongues were pooled , stained as described above , and sorted on a FACS AriaII ( BD Biosciences ) using FCS as a collection medium . Isolation of total RNA from bulk tongues or sorted cell populations was carried out according to standard protocols using Trizol Reagent ( Sigma ) or Trizol LS Reagent ( Life Technologies ) . cDNA was generated by RevertAid ( Thermo Scientific ) . Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green ( Roche ) and a Rotor-Gene 3000 ( Corbett Research ) or a QuantStudio 7 Flex ( LifeTechnologies ) . The primers were Actb fwd 5'-CCCTGAAGTACCCCATTGAAC-3' , Actb rev 5'-CTTTTCACGGTTGGCCTTAG-3'; Cxcl1 fwd 5'-CCGCTCGCTTTCTGTG-3' , Cxcl1 rev 5'-GCAGCTCATTGGCGATAG-3'; Cxcl2 fwd 5'-AGTGAACTGCGCTGTCAATGC-3' , Cxcl2 rev 5'-GCAAACTTTTTGACCGCCCT-3'; Cxcl5 fwd 5'- GAAAGCTAAGCGGAATGCAC-3' , Cxcl5 rev 5'-GGGACAATGGTTTCCCTTTT-3'; Csf3 fwd 5'-CTTAAGTCCCTGGAGCAAGTG-3' , Csf3 rev GTGGCCCAGCAACACCAG; Il1a fwd 5'-GGGAAGATTCTGAAGAAGAG-3' , Il1a rev 5'-TAACAGGATATTTAGAGTCG-3'; Il1b fwd 5'-TACAGGCTCCGAGATGAACA-3' , Il1b rev 5'-AGGCCACAGGTATTTTGTCG-3' . All qPCR assays were performed in duplicate and the relative gene expression ( rel . expr . ) of each gene was determined after normalization with β-actin transcript levels . For the preparation of cell lysates from sorted tongue cell populations , Brefeldin A ( 250 μg / mouse ) was injected i . p . 6 hours before removal of the tongue tissue . Brefeldin A was also added during the antibody staining and supplemented in the collection medium during cell sorting . Sorted cells were washed with PBS , and 400’000 cells of each population ( 60’000 for naïve leukocytes , 25’000 for LECs ) were lysed in 100 μl 0 . 1% Triton-X 100 in PBS containing cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail ( Roche ) using a Tissue Lyzer ( Qiagen ) for 3 minutes at 25 Hz . The G-CSF content of the lysates was analyzed immediately by ELISA ( see below ) . G-CSF protein in the serum , in cell lysates or in cell culture supernatants was determined by sandwich ELISA using purified anti-G-CSF ( clone 67604 , R&D Systems ) for coating and biotinylated polyclonal rabbit anti-G-CSF ( Peprotech ) for detection according to standard protocols . For determination of IL-1α and IL-1β levels in cell culture supernatants , cytometric bead array assays ( BD Biosciences ) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The detection limits are indicated by a dotted line . Tongues were embedded in OCT ( Sakura ) , snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20°C . For immunofluorescence staining , sagittal cryosections ( 9 μm ) , were fixed with acetone for 10 minutes at room temperature and stained with anti-IL-1α ( clone ALF-161 , BioXCell ) , anti-K6 ( BioLegend , poly19057 ) , anti-K14 ( BioLegend , poly19053 ) and 4′ , 6’-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride ( DAPI , Sigma-Aldrich ) . Slides were mounted with Mowiol ( VWR International AG ) , scanned with a NanoZoomer 2 . 0 HT ( Hamamatsu Photonics K . K . ) using 10x and 20x objectives , and analyzed using NDP . scan 2 . 5 . 88 . All scale bars indicate 100 μm . For whole mount confocal microscopy , tongues were longitudinally cut with a scalpel and fresh tissue was placed on 35mm microscopy dishes ( IBIDI ) with PBS . Z stack tile scans were acquired with an SP8 confocal microscope ( Leica ) equipped with a 20x APO objective ( 0 . 7 N . A . ) covering large areas of the tongue tissue . 3D maximum projections and mosaic reconstructions of the acquired data were generated with IMARIS ( Bitplane ) . Statistical significance was determined by Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction , one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s or Tukey’s multiple comparison test , or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test where appropriate using GraphPad Prism software with * , p < 0 . 05; ** , p < 0 . 01; *** , p < 0 . 001; **** p < 0 . 0001 . For data plotted on a logarithmic scale the geometric mean is indicated , and data were log-transformed before statistical analysis .   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Between 2000–2007 , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1 . 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs ( albendazole , ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine ) to all at-risk for 4–6 years . Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health . \\n As a leading cause of permanent and long-term disability worldwide , the parasitic infection lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) imposes a severe physical and socioeconomic burden on 1 . 3 billion at-risk persons in 83 endemic countries . An estimated 120 million people are already infected with LF , with about 40 million suffering from overt clinical disease manifested as painful severe swelling due to lymphedema ( generally an accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the limbs ) and hydrocele ( fluid accumulation in the scrotal sac ) . To rid the world of this debilitating disease , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) was begun in 2000 to guide endemic countries in implementing single-dose , once-yearly mass drug administration ( MDA ) using a combination of either albendazole+ivermectin or albendazole+diethylcarbamazine ( DEC ) for an anticipated 4–6 years . Use of this effective strategy for LF elimination has become feasible because of the drug donations of albendazole and ivermectin from their pharmaceutical manufacturers , GlaxoSmithKline and Merck & Co . , Inc , respectively . Over the first 8 operational years of the GPELF ( 2000–2007 ) , more than 1 . 9 billion MDA treatments were administered to approximately 570 million individuals in 48 countries . This significant programmatic achievement has resulted in a notably beneficial impact on the health of endemic populations [1] . More than 6 million cases of hydrocele and 4 million cases of lymphedema have been prevented , resulting in over 32 million disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs ) averted and numerous quality-of-life benefits attained . What remains relatively undefined , however , is the economic significance of these achievements . Specifically , how much financial cost and loss of income is prevented over the lifetimes of individuals protected from LF due to the first 8 years of the GPELF ? And , what cost savings do national health systems realize from the reduction in LF infection and morbidity ? To date , few attempts have been made to examine LF from an economic perspective , particularly on a global level . Such data , however , is invaluable to policymakers , public health administrators , and program funders who may already be convinced that LF is a ‘best buy’ in global health but who lack precise estimates to support their conviction . This study offers such an economic analysis and estimates that following the first 8 years of the GPELF , US$21 . 8 billion of economic benefits will be gained by LF infected and non-infected individuals in MDA-treated areas , in addition to US$2 . 2 billion in health systems savings . Furthermore , though this economic assessment has not included the value of the many ancillary benefits on other concurrent infections that are effectively treated by the anti-LF drug regimens , it still leads to a far better understanding of the GPELF's true overall impact on one of society's most debilitating and widespread tropical diseases . \\n Key data sources are listed below , though specific sources are cited throughout the paper: For this analysis , two broad groups of individuals are recognized as economically benefitting from the MDA treatment given during the first 8 years of the GPELF: Those protected from acquiring infection ( and subsequent disease [specifically , hydrocele and/or lymphedema] ) ; Those already infected but protected from disease progression . These two groups can be segmented into four sub-populations ( detailed below and summarized in Table 1 ) ; together , they constitute the “benefit cohort population” . Population estimates for each sub-population were calculated using the same base figures and key assumptions as described previously [1]; namely that 10% of the at-risk population is actually infected with LF , that this ratio would remain constant in the absence of MDA , and that the relative frequency of the clinical disease syndromes will also remain stable among those infected individuals . The previous section defined a 4-part benefit cohort population as the group of protected individuals who will realize economic benefits as a result of MDA activity between 2000–2007 . The total economic impact of the GPELF , however , extends over a much longer period than these first 8 years because protection from LF infection or disease progression is a lifelong benefit . It is therefore necessary to aggregate the total economic benefit gained over the projected remaining lifetime of the benefit cohort population . To estimate this total , a general formula ( Figure 1 ) was applied and calculated independently for each country to accommodate country specific differences in several key variables ( life expectancy , mortality rate , direct and indirect costs ) . All calculated costs and benefits are discounted to the base year of 2008 . For this study , 2008 was used as the base year for calculating economic benefits . When calculating future benefits , however , it is necessary to discount values to a net present value ( NPV ) under the economic principle that a dollar earned in the present is worth more than one earned in the future . Therefore , all annual accumulated cost savings beyond 2008 are discounted at 3% per year in accordance to guidelines set by WHO-CHOICE [53] . GPELF program costs can be compared with the economic benefits calculated in this study through a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the efficiency and practicality of implementing the Global Programme . Estimating program costs , however , is not the intent of this study and such data was , therefore , sourced through our previously published work [54] . On a macro-level , no study has yet been conducted to estimate the total cost of the GPELF over its first 8 years and as a result , a broader programmatic cost-benefit analysis cannot be calculated . It is possible , however , to estimate the cost-benefit on an individual-level using per person costs calculated in a multi-country study of national MDA program costs for LF including training , mapping , mobilization , distribution , monitoring , and surveillance [54] . In this study , Goldman et al . analyzed both the average annual economic cost per person treated ( i . e . including the implied costs of donated materials and drugs – set at US$0 . 19+$0 . 0019 for shipping per 400mg tablet of albendazole and US$1 . 50+$0 . 0018 per 3mg tablet of ivermectin ) and also the financial cost per person treated ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) from data collected through questionnaires and adjusted for LF-specific activities . Donated ivermectin is used in combination with donated albendazole in areas co-endemic for onchocerciasis in Africa plus Yemen . DEC , which is not donated , is used in combination with donated albendazole in all other countries and must be purchased by national programs . In terms of per person economic benefits , the total economic benefits estimated over one year in this study was divided by the total number of people treated with MDA in that same year . For this analysis , per person economic benefits were only calculated for the 7 countries whose program costs were also evaluated in Goldman et al . 's study . Cost-benefit was then measured using benefit-cost ratios ( BCR ) , which is the per person treated benefit divided by the per person treated cost . For standardization purposes , the BCR reflects costs , benefits , and currencies adjusted to the year of the most recent MDA round in Goldman et al . 's study . \\n During the first 8 years of LF MDA , the Global Programme delivered nearly 2 billion treatments and reached almost 570 million individuals in 48 of the 83 identified endemic countries ( Table 4 ) . As a result of these program achievements , 31 . 4 million individuals – defined in this study as the benefit cohort population – will gain economic benefits over their lifetime from averting direct treatment costs and indirect lost-labor costs . Of these 31 . 4 million individuals in the benefit cohort population , 2 . 7 million ( 8 . 6% ) would have acquired LF and subsequently progressed to clinical disease but were protected from infection altogether because of interruption of the transmission cycle by MDA . This group comprises the proportion of newborns ( 2 . 2 million ) that are protected by virtue of being born in MDA-treated areas , as well as other individuals in the general population ( 0 . 5 million ) protected because LF transmission has been interrupted . The remaining 28 . 7 million ( 91 . 4% ) individuals are those who were already infected at the time of MDA treatment but benefit from halted disease progression . This population group comprises individuals at the subclinical disease stage ( 9 . 4 million , [29 . 9%] ) who avoid clinical disease altogether and individuals at the clinical disease stage ( 19 . 3 million [61 . 6%] ) whose conditions may improve following MDA . As seen in Table 5 , the efforts in reaching and administering MDA to such a large population have produced extraordinary economic benefits over the first 8 years of the GPELF . An estimated US$21 . 8 billion will be saved over the lifetimes of the 31 . 4 million individuals who have or would have acquired clinical disease during this timeframe . This total amount results from summing the direct treatment costs ( $1 . 4b ) and indirect lost wages ( $20 . 4b ) prevented over the lifetime of each of the population groups under the assumptions and estimates previously outlined in Table 3 . Direct costs for acute disease were calculated based on the aggregate number of ADL episodes expected in the absence of MDA and the average cost incurred per episode . Chronic disease direct costs were derived from the percentage and total number of patients seeking treatment multiplied by the average cost spent per treatment . Indirect costs for both acute and chronic disease were calculated by accruing the equivalent workdays lost to LF and multiplying this total by the average daily wage . All average costs and rate of disease estimates were weighted annually by country-specific estimates and with respect to total number of person-years . On average , each individual of the benefit cohort population will avoid nearly $700 in LF-associated costs that would have accrued over his/her lifetime . This equates to the amount earned for 19 working days per person-year , thus preventing the loss of approximately 6 . 3% of annual income ( Table 6 ) . These sums and averages are even greater when considered in a single year-to-year perspective , since beyond 2008 , each year of economic benefit is discounted by 3% per year . Table 6 also shows that the infected patient sub-population groups ( i . e . clinical and subclinical ) have the greatest total lifetime benefits based on their larger proportion of the total benefit cohort population . On a per person lifetime average , however , subclinical ( Group 2a ) and ‘other protected individuals’ ( Group 1b ) benefits are larger . Figure 3 highlights the total economic benefit segmented by cost , morbidity , and clinical presentation . Economic benefits to national health systems resulting from reduced LF infections derive particularly from patient service costs averted in the public sector . Approximately US$2 . 2 billion in health system costs will be saved over the lifetime of the benefit cohort population ( Table 8 ) . Combined with the US$21 . 8 billion savings for individuals , the total economic benefit following the first 8 years of the GPELF is estimated at an extraordinary US$24 . 0 billion ( Figure 4 ) . This overall economic analysis of the GPELF's first 8 years does have notable limitations due to the lack of regionalized primary data concerning both epidemiological and socioeconomic factors associated with LF . Indeed , two sections of the model remain with particular uncertainty: 1 ) The degree to which MDA can reverse or return an individual with overt clinical disease to regular productivity , and 2 ) The relationship between hours lost and output/productivity lost due to disease . The total estimated economic impact is particularly sensitive to these variables because of the large number of clinical disease patients receiving MDA and the high proportion of total prevented costs that come from indirect labor costs . As a result , sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the range of economic benefits that can be achieved under varying estimates of each variable . Secondary sensitivity analyses investigating the frequency and duration of ADL episodes , and direct treatment costs indicated less variability of economic benefits when adjusting these parameters . Goldman et al . found the average annual economic cost per person treated ( i . e . including the implied costs of donated materials and drugs – set at US$0 . 19+$0 . 0019 for shipping per 400mg tablet of albendazole and US$1 . 50+$0 . 0018 per 3mg tablet of ivermectin ) ranged from US$0 . 40 in Philippines to $5 . 82 in Tanzania . The average annual financial cost per person treated ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) ranged from US$0 . 06 in Burkina Faso to US$1 . 34 in Haiti [54] . One-year economic benefits per person treated in this study ranged from US$1 . 00 in Burkina Faso to US$4 . 56 in the Dominican Republic . Table 10 compares these economic benefit estimates with the economic and financial costs from Goldman et al . 's study to calculate country-specific BCRs . The economic cost BCR for the three African countries using the ivermectin+albendazole regimen are lower ( 0 . 21–0 . 37 ) than those in countries using DEC+albendazole ( 1 . 23–8 . 59 ) . Since the drugs , however , are available at no cost to the GPELF , BCRs calculated using financial costs are more favorable , ranging from 1 . 64 in Egypt to 18 . 07 in the Philippines . \\n In Table 10 , the BCRs calculated with economic costs are low , particularly for the African countries using the ivermectin+albendazole regimen . In reality , however , the whole foundation of the GPELF is the long-term , sustained commitment of drug donations offered by GlaxoSmithKline for albendazole and Merck & Co . , Inc . for ivermectin for as long as needed until LF is eliminated [72] , [73] . Because of this commitment , governments and donors will never have to finance these costs themselves; indeed , without these commitments there would be no GPELF . Therefore , understanding the financial costs ( i . e . excluding the costs of the donated materials and drugs ) to the GPELF is more relevant for policy- and decision-making than is the analysis of economic costs . When comparing financial costs to economic benefits , then , Table 10 shows very favorable BCRs , including up to 18 . 07 in the Philippines . Whether examining financial or economic costs , the BCR becomes larger in the years beyond the recommended 5 rounds of MDA to achieve lifetime protection from LF . The Goldman et al . study [54] showed strong evidence that costs decrease after the initial year of implementation and after 5 rounds of MDA , the drug costs and majority of program activities would arguably subside dramatically as well . In the Philippines for example , by conservatively extrapolating the initial year's annual economic cost over 5 years , the cost to lifetime benefit ratio indicates that a $1 investment leads to a sizable return of $60 per individual treated . While this analysis does not account for costs following the 5th round of MDA ( e . g . post-MDA surveillance ) , it can be reasonably assumed that the BCR would still remain very significant . Indeed , even if annual economic costs were to persist at an equivalent rate for an additional 10 to 15 years , the economic rate of return per person treated is still approximately $20–$30 for every $1 invested . Comparing the cost-benefit of the GPELF to that of other NTD programs is difficult because there are few directly comparable analyses , particularly at a global level . A review of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control ( APOC ) projected an economic rate of return of 6% to 17% but did not factor in the implied economic cost of the donated drug [74] . This finding is less than the drug-excluded LF cost-benefit estimate presented here , however , several economic benefits apart from onchocercal blindness prevention were not analyzed in the APOC review . Cost-benefit analyses for trachoma have focused almost exclusively on trichiasis surgery in a localized context [75] . A broader array of cost-benefit studies has been carried out for malaria , although with differing scopes and outcome goals , making it challenging to compare results across the same disease , let alone between malaria and LF . In a review of several malaria costing studies , the BCR ranged from 1 . 9 to 17 . 1 using a variety of human capital and burden of disease methodologies [76] . Other approaches assessing a more macroeconomic impact of malaria [77] , [78] have yet to be applied to NTDs but future research into such cost-benefit applications will be critical for validating the investment of the GPELF and stimulating likeminded investigations for related global NTD programs . There has been considerable movement – particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa – toward integrating preventive chemotherapy programs to target multiple NTDs ( e . g . LF , onchocerciasis , schistosomiasis , soil-transmitted helminths [STH] , trachoma ) together . Although there is no clear verdict yet on the benefits of integrated NTD treatments versus standalone vertical programs , early assessments indicate potential savings of 25–47% for the entire group of NTDs can be achieved in Sub-Saharan Africa by packaging MDA interventions together [79] . These findings underlie an important concept of economic analysis , specifically that although an intervention ( e . g . vertically integrated MDA programs for LF ) may have a favorable BCR , there may be more cost-effective alternatives to achieving a similar outcome ( e . g . the number of treatments administered , the total economic benefits of the GPELF ) . In this respect , the GPELF is well positioned to take advantage of synergistic opportunities with other disease program activities including vector control ( malaria and dengue fever ) , surveillance ( guinea worm , onchocerciasis ) , and distribution ( integrated NTDs , Vitamin A ) to maximize cost-effectiveness and economic impact [80] . Joint efforts with the private sector and drug development projects addressing improved sanitation and housing facilities could also contribute to greater cost-effectiveness for the GPELF [81] . While this study is not positioned to analyze cost-effectiveness in details , it is abundantly clear that under any joint or standalone scenario , the GPELF indeed represents an excellent buy in global health . The prevention of LF infection and clinical disease has led to additional benefits that are difficult or impossible to quantify in monetary terms . The true economic value of the GPELF is , therefore , arguably much higher based on the numerous quality-of-life benefits achieved through clinical disease aversion , as well as the economic impact that MDA has on other diseases and syndromes related to LF . A narrow range of country-specific primary data somewhat limits the breadth of economic analysis presented in this paper; however , much of the prevailing literature originates from India and Sub-Saharan African countries where over 75% of the benefit cohort population resides . Of significance , there is scarce regional data regarding treatment-seeking behavior for LF patients , but because this is a direct cost input , more exact data would result in only marginal changes to the overall economic impact . Similarly , LF disease-specific parameters ( e . g . ADL frequency and duration , lost workdays ) were attributed a global standardized estimate due to a lack of regional data . Sensitivity analyses conducted earlier in this study presented the resulting economic impact under differing degrees of pathology and indeed , a clearer understanding of regional variability would enrich future economic analyses . Other variables such as wages , health system costs , and direct treatment costs , however , were able to be made region- and country-specific with the aid of international databases from the ILO , WHO , and World Bank . Despite important limitations to our analysis , this study identifies a wide array of economic benefits that have resulted from the first 8 years of the GPELF – approximately US$21 . 8 billion of direct and indirect patient costs will be prevented in the lifetimes of more than 31 million individuals , US$2 . 2 billion of LF-associated patient services saved by national health systems over the lifetimes of the MDA-treated individuals , and additional quality-of-life benefits and treatment of co-morbidities such as STH that make the total economic value of the GPELF unquestionably far greater than the calculable estimate presented here . These achievements notwithstanding , it is clear that the economic impact will be even greater when the GPELF reaches the remaining endemic countries and at-risk populations . Currently , the GPELF has extended to 48 of the 83 endemic countries and treated nearly 570 million individuals – approximately 44% of the ∼1 . 3 billion worldwide at-risk population [8] . Extrapolating this proportion with the US$24 billion lifetime economic benefit already achieved , the full potential economic benefit of the GPELF could be in excess of US$55 billion distributed over each of the endemic WHO regions ( Figure 5 ) . Reaching the remaining at-risk individuals presents notable challenges especially since much of the population not yet reached resides in some of the poorest countries in Africa . Additional resources and economic empowerment will be necessary to assist these countries in implementing programs for LF elimination [91] . The expansion of the GPELF will therefore be a critical building block in this effort and also an important driver for increased attention to NTDs and the continuation of integrated NTD programs . The recognition of the sizable monetary benefit already achieved after 8 years provides new confidence that it is an investment well worth undertaking .   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) gene result in Gaucher disease ( GD ) , the most common lysosomal storage disease . Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD . \\n Gaucher disease ( GD ) is the most common lysosomal storage disease and is caused by homozygous mutations in glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) . Mutations in GBA lead to decreased enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) and result in the accumulation of its substrates , glucocerebroside and glucosylsphingosine[1 , 2] . GD is classically divided into three subtypes: a non-neuronopathic form ( type 1 ) , an acute neuronopathic form ( type 2 ) , and a subacute neuronopathic form ( type 3 ) . Visceral manifestations of all forms are characterized by hepatosplenomegaly , cytopenia , and skeletal disease . Pathologically , the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages , called Gaucher cells , are observed in the affected organs . Neurological manifestations of neuronopathic forms include brainstem dysfunction , intellectual disability , seizures , and myoclonic movement . Pathological features of neuronopathic forms are neuronal loss , astrogliosis , microgliosis , and perivascular accumulation of Gaucher cells[3] . The most severe neuronopathic form , called the perinatal lethal type , has also been reported[4] . Common presentations of patients with the perinatal lethal type are hydrops fetalis and congenital ichthyosis . Almost no residual GCase enzymatic activity is found in these cases . Because currently available therapies are ineffective for neurological manifestations , a strong demand exists for elucidation of the pathological mechanisms and the development of novel therapies . Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder . GBA has recently drawn considerable attention because heterozygous mutations in this gene confer a high risk for sporadic PD[5 , 6] . In addition , patients with type 1 GD also have an increased life-time risk of developing PD[7] . PD patients carrying GBA mutations show intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites , which are the pathological hallmarks of sporadic PD[3] . Several cellular , animal , and postmortem studies have indicated an association between GBA mutations and α-syn accumulation . For example , deficiency in GCase enzymatic activity causes lysosomal dysfunction and α-syn accumulation[8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12] . Increased α-syn in turn creates a vicious cycle by inhibiting the trafficking of GCase to lysosomes , thus leading to decreased GCase activity in lysosomes[9] . Consistent with this notion , mouse models overexpressing α-syn and postmortem tissue from patients with PD show reduced GCase activity in the brains[13 , 14 , 15] . Although several hypotheses have been proposed , further mechanisms of how GBA mutations contribute to the development of PD remain elusive . Medaka ( Oryzias latipes ) are a versatile vertebrate animal model for disease research . These fish are easy to handle , have a relatively short generation time ( 2–3 months ) , produce a large number of progeny per generation , and have several inbred strains[16] . Importantly , medaka have an advantage as an animal model of PD due to endogenous α-syn in contrast to invertebrate models that lack α-syn . Moreover , several genetic manipulations can be performed in medaka in addition to established transgenic techniques[17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21] . So far , we have reported genetic PD models of medaka that develop locomotor dysfunction accompanied by the selective loss of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons[22 , 23] . Considering these lines of evidence , medaka have the potential to be a new animal model of PD . Here , we generated GBA nonsense mutant medaka and found that homozygous GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka are a viable neuronopathic GD model . GBA-/- medaka developed remarkable α-syn accumulation in the brains and thus provide novel insights into the association of GBA mutations with α-syn accumulation . Furthermore , we revealed minimal contribution of endogenous α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . \\n We generated GBA nonsense mutant medaka to investigate the mechanisms by which GBA mutation leads to PD . To identify medaka GBA orthologs , we searched the medaka genome database ( http://www . ensembl . org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index ) with the basic local alignment search tool and found only one ortholog of human GBA . We cloned the medaka GBA with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends and found that this gene has 11 exons encoding a protein of 522 amino acids . The amino acid sequence of medaka GBA showed 53% homology to that of human GBA ( S1 Fig ) . Next , we screened a targeting-induced local lesions in genome ( TILLING ) library for medaka GBA using a high-resolution melting assay[17 , 24] . We identified a nonsense mutant ( W337X ) and generated the nonsense mutant medaka by in vitro fertilization ( Fig . 1A ) . We examined GCase activity in the brains of GBA mutants after crossing with heterozygous mutants . GBAW337X/W337X ( GBA-/- ) medaka showed complete deficiency in GCase activity , and GBAWT/W337X ( GBA+/- ) medaka showed a decrease in GCase activity of about 50% compared to wild-type ( GBA+/+ ) medaka ( Fig . 1B ) . Although humans and mice lacking GCase activity die soon after birth[4 , 25 , 26] , GBA-/- medaka survived for more than 3 months , enabling us to analyze the pathological progression ( Fig . 1D ) . GBA-/- medaka showed abnormal rotating swimming movement at 2 months ( S1 , S2 Movie ) and the abnormal appearance of a bent spine at 3 months ( Fig . 1C ) . High levels of glucocerebroside accumulated in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 1E ) , whereas the amount of galactocerebroside , an isomer of glucocerebroside , was not changed . Glucocerebroside with C18 fatty acids was the most dominant type in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( S2 Fig ) , an observation that is consistent with the neuronopathic GD mouse model[27] . We performed pathological analyses of GBA-/- medaka . Patients with GD show Periodic acid-Schiff-positive Gaucher cells in affected visceral organs such as the liver , spleen , and bone marrow , whereas GBA-/- medaka showed abnormal Periodic acid-Schiff-positive cells in the spleen and kidney , but not in the liver , at 3 months ( S3 Fig ) . Next , we examined the brains of GBA-/- medaka and found abnormal cells with large vacuoles mainly in the periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum ( Fig . 2A , B ) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed that these cells were macrophage-like and had large vacuoles containing filamentous structures ( Fig . 2C ) . Similar filamentous structures are observed in Gaucher cells of patients with GD and mouse models of GD[26 , 28 , 29] . The staining intensity with Luxol fast blue was decreased , and single-stranded DNA ( ssDNA ) -positive cells were observed in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D ) , indicating myelin loss and cell death , respectively . In situ hybridization for apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) , a microglial marker in teleost fish[30] , revealed proliferating activated microglia in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D ) . Teleost fish have glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) -expressing radial glial cells ( or ependymoglial cells ) instead of astrocytes as in mammals[31] . Humans and mice with neuronopathic GD show astrogliosis in their brains[3 , 32] , whereas neither proliferation of GFAP-positive radial glial cells nor elevated levels of GFAP were observed in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2D , E ) . To investigate the type of neuronal cells that die in GBA-/- medaka , we counted the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase ( TH ) -positive dopaminergic neurons in the middle diencephalon , which corresponds to the human substantia nigra[33] , TH-positive noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus , and tryptophan hydroxylase ( TPH ) -positive serotonergic neurons in the superior raphe at 2 and 3 months . GBA-/- medaka showed progressive cell loss of all these neurons ( Fig . 2F ) . Consistent with these findings , the amount of TH was decreased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 2G ) . Collectively , GBA-/- medaka exhibited neuronopathic GD-like pathology including progressive and non-selective neuronal loss . Medaka express α-syn , which is a protein consisting of 127 amino acids . To investigate α-syn pathology in GBA-/- medaka , we created a medaka α-syn antibody against the epitope of amino acids 90 to 104 ( S4A Fig ) . Medaka also express β-synuclein , γ-synuclein-a , and γ-synuclein-b in addition to α-syn , but these other synucleins do not have amino acid sequences homologous to the epitope of the medaka α-syn antibody ( S4B Fig ) . Next , we generated α-syn deletion mutant medaka using TALENs . Deletion of 11 bases near the start codon in α-syn resulted in a frame shift mutation ( S4C Fig ) . Wild-type , heterozygous , and homozygous α-syn deletion mutant ( α-syn+/+ , α-syn+/- , and α-syn-/- , respectively ) medaka could be distinguished with PCR analysis of α-syn ( S4D Fig ) . RT-PCR analysis of α-syn mRNA revealed that α-syn-/- medaka did not express intact α-syn mRNA ( S4E Fig ) . Western blot analysis with the medaka α-syn antibody revealed a 14-kDa band , which was specifically found in α-syn+/+ medaka ( S4F Fig ) . The authenticity of the antibody was confirmed by the lack of immunostaining with the medaka α-syn antibody in the brains of α-syn-/- medaka ( S4G Fig ) . Consistent with the findings in mammals , medaka α-syn was mainly found presynaptically with immunoelectron microscopy ( S4H Fig ) . Then , we performed immunohistochemical analysis and found abundant α-syn accumulation in the brains of GBA-/- medaka at 3 months ( Fig . 3A ) . α-syn accumulation was also observed at 2 months , but not at 1 month ( S5 Fig ) . Abnormal structures observed with toluidine blue staining were similar to α-syn accumulations in size and distribution ( Fig . 3A ) . Transmission electron microscopy revealed numerous axonal swellings containing vacuoles and other various materials in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Figs . 3B , S6A ) . A considerable number of these vacuoles had double membranes and sometimes contained mitochondria , suggesting that these vacuoles were autophagosomes . Consistent with this , LC3 , an autophagosomal marker , accumulated in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3A ) . Moreover , immunogold-labeled α-syn was detected in axonal swellings with immunoelectron microscopy ( Fig . 3C ) . Conventional and confocal double immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that accumulated α-syn colocalized with LC3 accumulations ( Fig . 3D ) , and a considerable portion of the α-syn signals in axonal swellings colocalized with LC3 signals ( Figs . 3E , S6B ) . In addition to these findings , ubiquitin also accumulated in α-syn-positive axonal swellings ( Figs . 3E , S6B ) . To examine the α-syn expression level and solubility , we performed sequential biochemical fractionation assays . The total amount of α-syn in the Triton-soluble fraction was not increased in GBA-/- medaka . However , when adjusted for the amount of neuron-specific enolase ( NSE ) and considering the robust neuronal loss in GBA-/- medaka , α-syn was significantly increased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . The decreased amount of neurofilament also reflected the neuronal loss in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . No apparent α-syn band was detected in the Triton-insoluble , SDS-soluble fraction in all genotypes . In agreement with the accumulation of autophagosomes in axonal swellings , the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I was increased in GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 3F ) . Meanwhile , we also investigated the phenotypes of GBA+/- medaka because heterozygous mutations in GBA are a strong risk for PD[5 , 6] . However , GBA+/- medaka even at 12 months did not show any apparent abnormal phenotypes including α-syn pathology , the numbers of TH-positive neurons , swimming movement , or the amounts of several neurotransmitters ( S7A–S7E Fig ) . Previous studies of GD mouse models reported that p62/SQSTM1 ( an autophagic substrate ) accumulates in neurons and astrocytes[34] , and the number of Cathepsin D-positive puncta is decreased in neurons[35] . These observations prompted us to examine the autophagy-lysosome pathway in GBA-/- medaka . Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ubiquitin- and p62-positive aggregates were observed mainly in the perikarya of neurons ( Figs . 4A , D , S8B ) . These aggregates were observed only in neurons and not in GFAP-positive radial glial cells or Lycopersicon Esculentum ( Tomato ) Lectin ( LEL ) -positive microglia ( S8A Fig ) . LEL is an excellent teleost microglial marker[36] . Western blot analysis showed that the amounts of ubiquitin and p62 were increased in the brains of GBA-/- medaka ( Fig . 4C ) . In contrast , these aggregates did not colocalize with LC3 accumulations or Cathepsin D-positive organelles ( Figs . 4D , S8B ) . These organelles , which are putative lysosomes , showed decreased Cathepsin D staining intensity and abnormal morphology ( Fig . 4A ) . Consistent with this , neurons that contained lysosome-like organelles filled with filamentous structures were observed with transmission electron microscopy ( Fig . 4B ) . GBA nonsense mutant medaka have random point mutations in the genome at loci other than GBA . Therefore , we performed a rescue experiment to determine whether the abnormal phenotypes observed in GBA-/- medaka were really caused by GBA mutation . We created medaka GBA-expressing vectors driven by a medaka growth-associated protein 43 ( GAP-43 ) promoter ( S9A Fig ) [37] . GAP-43 mRNA is expressed mainly in nervous system in medaka[37] . We established six medaka GBA transgenic lines ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ) using these vectors and crossed them with GBA nonsense mutant medaka . Each line of GBA-/- medaka with GBA transgene ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ;GBA-/- ) showed GCase activity of various levels in the brains at 3 months ( S9B Fig ) . All lines of Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ;GBA-/- medaka showed normal swimming movement at 2 months ( S3 Movie ) . Also , the swimming distance was increased in Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) line3;GBA-/- medaka ( S9C Fig ) . Pathological analysis of the brains of Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) line3;GBA-/- medaka including hematoxylin and eosin staining , in situ hybridization for APOE , and immunohistochemistry for p62 and α-syn revealed no apparent abnormality ( S9D Fig ) . We concluded that the abnormal phenotypes observed in the brains of GBA-/- medaka were caused by the GBA mutation . Many studies have reported that accumulated α-syn caused by α-syn overexpression results in neurotoxicity[38] . Neuroinflammation is observed in the brains of patients with PD , and much evidence shows that neuroinflammation promotes disease progression[39] . Moreover , a recent study reported that oligomeric α-syn released from neurons activates inflammatory responses in microglia[40] . We examined the toxicity of α-syn in GBA-/- medaka by crossing GBA nonsense mutant medaka with α-syn deletion mutant medaka . α-syn-/- medaka showed no apparent abnormal phenotypes in their outer appearance , swimming movement , or life span like α-syn-disrupted mice[41] . The life spans of GBA-/-α-syn+/- and GBA-/-α-syn-/- medaka were not prolonged compared to that of GBA-/-α-syn+/+ medaka ( Fig . 5A ) . Moreover , the number of LC3-positive puncta was not changed in GBA-/-α-syn-/- medaka , indicating that α-syn was not primarily involved in formation of axonal swellings ( Fig . 5B ) . The numbers of dopaminergic neurons in the middle diencephalon and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus were not changed in either GBA-/- α-syn+/- or GBA-/- α-syn-/- medaka ( Fig . 5C ) . We also examined the extent of neuroinflammation with in situ hybridization for APOE and quantitative RT-PCR for tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) α mRNA . The number of APOE-positive cells and the expression level of TNFα were not changed ( Fig . 5D , E ) . Collectively , we found no evidence for α-syn involvement in the short life span , formation of axonal swellings , dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss , and neuroinflammation that are observed in GBA -/- medaka . \\n To date , several genetic animal models of neuronopathic GD including mouse , dog , and sheep have been reported[42] . Gba null mice die within 24 hours of birth due to permeability barrier defects in the skin[26 , 43] . Thus , conditional knockout K14-lnl/lnl mice with normal GCase activity in their skin were generated[27] . However , use of these mice is limited because they survive only 2 weeks after birth . Mice harboring a Gba missense mutation combined with prosaposin- or saposin C-deficient mice , another neuronopathic GD model , also show neuronopathic abnormalities[29 , 34] and have the advantage of longer survival than K14-lnl/lnl mice . However , the relevance of these mice to neuronopathic GD is controversial . The present study revealed that GBA-/- medaka survive long enough for pathological analysis of disease progression . As an example , GBA-/- medaka showed α-syn accumulation at 2 months , not at 1 month after fertilization . Considering these observations , GBA-/- medaka are useful as a viable neuronopathic GD model with endogenous α-syn accumulation . GBA-/- medaka showed several phenotypes different from those of mammalian neuronopathic GD model . Firstly , the skin of GBA-/- medaka looks intact whereas severe skin lesion is observed in patients with perinatal lethal type GD and Gba null mice[4 , 43] . Secondly , GBA-/- medaka exhibited PAS-positive abnormal cells in spleen and kidney which presumably correspond to human Gaucher cells . In patients with GD , Gaucher cells are not found in kidney , but in liver , spleen and bone marrow . These differences could be explained by the fact that in adult teleost fish kidney has hematopoietic function instead of mammalian bone marrow[44] . Lastly , the proliferation of GFAP-positive radial glial cells was not observed in GBA-/- medaka whereas astrogliosis is observed in humans and mice with neuronopathic GD . It was reported that the reaction of GFAP-positive radial glial cells to inflammation is different from that of mammalian astrocytes[31] . Lysosomes play a fundamental role in the autophagic pathway by fusing with autophagosomes and digesting their contents[45] . In general , lysosomal dysfunction results in defective digestion and accumulation of autophagic substrates such as polyubiquitinated proteins , p62 , and dysfunctional mitochondria , accompanied by accumulation of autophagosomes . Axonal swellings containing autophagosome-like structures are observed in mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases such as neuronopathic GD mice , Niemann-pick type C1 mice , Cathepsin D-deficient mice , and Cathepsin B/L double-deficient mice[34 , 46 , 47] . A previous study reported that autophagosomes are formed in the distal part of the axon and undergo retrograde transport toward the cell body[48] . Another previous study demonstrated that inhibition of lysosomal function in primary neurons from mouse embryos disrupts the axonal transport of autophagosomes and causes their accumulation in axons[49] . Considering these lines of evidence , we propose that GCase deficiency primarily causes lysosomal dysfunction , leading to disrupted retrograde transport of autophagosomes in axons and formation of axonal swellings with α-syn accumulation ( Fig . 6 ) . Contrary to our expectations , p62-positive aggregates did not colocalize with LC3- and α-syn-positive axonal swellings , but were mainly located in the perikarya of neurons . These results suggest the possibility that presynaptic α-syn is transported proximally and degraded in a p62-independent autophagy-lysosome pathway . A previous study supports this hypothesis . Conditional knockout mice lacking ATG7 in TH-positive neurons show α-syn aggregates in swollen axons in the striatum , but not in cell bodies in the midbrain , indicating that autophagic dysfunction initially causes α-syn aggregates in the distal part of axons[50] . In addition , another previous study demonstrated that α-syn aggregation occurs earlier in axons than in neuronal cell bodies in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in PD patients[51] . Because axonal retrograde transport may be involved in the degradative pathway of α-syn and may be a therapeutic target in PD , further studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms . Because GBA+/- medaka as old as 12 months did not show any apparent abnormal phenotypes , we could not directly investigate how heterozygous GBA mutations cause PD . Meanwhile , according to a recent report , induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from PD patients carrying heterozygous GBA mutations show α-syn accumulation , an impaired autophagy-lysosome pathway , and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis[12] . The reason for differences in phenotypes between in vivo and in vitro models is unclear . However , our findings from GBA+/- medaka seem to be reasonable because the penetrance of PD in GBA mutation carriers is estimated to be at most 30% by the age of 80 years[52] . Thus , second hits such as environmental factors and other genetic factors are probably required for the development of PD pathology in vivo . Cellular and animal PD models overexpressing α-syn have provided evidence for the various potential toxic mechanisms of α-syn . However , few studies have demonstrated the pathological role of endogenous α-syn in vivo , which may reflect the authentic role for α-syn in PD . A previous study showed that α-syn null mice are resistant to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 , 2 , 3 , 6-tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) toxicity compared with wild-type mice[53] . However , it is unclear whether this improvement is due to attenuation of α-syn toxicity or α-syn-mediated changes in the presynaptic machinery . Another previous study showed that the formation of intraneuronal inclusions and neurodegeneration in 26S proteasome-depleted mice is independent of α-syn[54] . In the present study , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Moreover , α-syn was not involved in the accumulation of autophagosomes in axons . Our data indicate that α-syn accumulation is a downstream event , and other severe pathological factors may obscure the involvement of α-syn in the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . In summary , the present study showed that GBA-/- medaka are useful as a viable neuronopathic GD model with endogenous α-syn accumulation . Long-term survival of these fish allows us to observe the pathological progression . Our data revealed that GCase deficiency causes lysosomal dysfunction in neurons and α-syn accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Axonal transport of α-syn may play an important role in the mechanisms of GBA mutations leading to PD and may also be a therapeutic target in PD . Furthermore , we demonstrate the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka . GBA-/- medaka represent a valuable model for exploring the pathological mechanisms and also provide a new platform for developing treatments in PD with GBA mutations as well as neuronopathic GD . \\n Medaka were anesthetized in 0 . 02% tricaine in fish water and then sacrificed . All experimental procedures used in this study followed national guidelines . The Animal Research Committee of Kyoto University granted a formal waiver of ethical approval and also granted permission . Medaka of the Kyoto-cab strain , a substrain of Cab , were maintained at 27°C in a recirculating aquaculture system . Adult fish were kept in a reproduction regimen ( 14 hr light/10 hr dark ) . Eggs were kept in a dark box at 28°C . RNA was extracted from wild-type medaka brains with Qiazol ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit ( Perfect Real Time ) ( TaKaRa , #RR037A ) . To identify medaka GBA , SNCA , SNCGb , p62/SQSTM1 , and MAP1LC3B orthologs , we referred to the medaka genome database ( http://www . ensembl . org/Oryzias_latipes/Info/Index ) . Because their cDNA sequences and amino acid sequences were not completely known , we determined their cDNA sequences using a combination of RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends , the products of which were generated using Seegene’s Capfishing kit ( Seegene ) . The cDNA sequences can be found in the European Nucleotide Archive ( ENA , accession numbers LM644999–645003 ) . GBA mutant medaka were generated as described[17] . To find GBA mutations in the TILLING library , we narrowed down mutated candidates from 5 , 771 samples using a high-resolution melting assay , followed by determination of the DNA sequences[24] . We screened the TILLING library for exons 1–2 , exons 5–7 , exon 8 , and exons 9–11 of GBA . In vitro fertilization was carried out using sperm from a sample with the favorable mutation . To genotype the progeny of GBAWT/W337X mutants , PCR was performed with the following primer set ( 5′-AGGGTTGAAGGGGTTAAGCA-3′ , 5′-TTGTAACCAGTACCGCAGCA-3′ ) , designed HybProbes ( 5′-LC Red 640-CATGTACCAGTGGACG-Phosphate-3′ , 5′-CCTAAGCTTATATCTGCAGGGACTAAACTGT-Fluorescein-3′ ) , and LightCycler 480 Probes Master in LightCycler 480 ( Roche ) according to the manufacturer's instructions . The genotypes can be distinguished with high-resolution melting curve analysis . GBAWT/W337X mutants were back-crossed to Kyoto-Cab medaka at least seven times and then crossed to obtain GBAW337X/W337X mutants . For the rescue experiment , we established GBA transgenic medaka in which medaka GBA expression was driven by the medaka GAP-43 promoter ( Tg ( GAP-43:GBA ) ) . We used an insulator located in the upstream region of sea urchin ( Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus ) arylsulfatase[55 , 56] . The transgenic construct was flanked by two insulators and included the medaka GAP-43 promoter followed by an internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) , enhanced GFP ( EGFP ) , and the Simian virus 40 polyadenylation site or the medaka β-actin 3′-untranslated region ( 3′UTR ) ( S8A Fig ) . The medaka GAP-43 promoter contained a 1 . 0-kb fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the gene . A DNA fragment of the transgene was inserted into EcoR I/Sal I restriction enzyme sites of the pDs-actb2k-EGFP plasmid . pDs-actb2k-EGFP was constructed by inserting an Xho I/Spe I fragment from pactb2k-EGFP into the Xho I/Spe I site of the pDs-GTDEL4 plasmid , which contains 5′- and 3′-Ds sequences[21 , 57] . The resultant vector was injected into the cytoplasm of fertilized Kyoto-Cab eggs before the first cleavage as described[20] . α-syn deletion mutant medaka were generated with TALENs as described[58] . To genotype the progeny of α-syn deletion mutants , PCR was performed with the following primer set ( 5′-GATCCCGAGCCATCCAC-3′ , 5′-TGCAACTGTGGAAACACCAT-3′ ) , followed by electrophoresis in a 10% ( w/v ) polyacrylamide gel ( S4D Fig ) . RT-PCR for α-syn was performed with the following primer sets ( α-syn: 5′-GATCCCGAGCCATCCAC-3′ , 5′-TTTGGAGAAACCCTTCATTAAC-3′; β-actin: 5′-TCCACCTTCCAGCAGATGTG-3′ , 5′-AGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3′ ) ( S4E Fig ) . The spontaneous swimming movement of medaka was traced using a video camera positioned above the water tank and analyzed with ethovision XT 5 ( Noldus ) . The water tank was a transparent circular container ( 20 cm diameter , 2 cm water depth , room temperature ) . Image acquisition began 5 min after medaka were placed in a new water tank . Data were collected continuously for the subsequent 3 min . The assay for GCase enzymatic activity was performed as described[11] . Medaka brains were homogenized in 40 μl sample buffer ( 10 mM Tris-HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , pH 7 . 4 ) , sonicated , and centrifuged at 10 , 000 ×g at 4°C for 5 min . Aliquots containing 50 μg protein were incubated in assay buffer ( 5 mM 4-Methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucopyranoside ( Wako , #324–37441 ) , 1% ( w/v ) sodium taurocholate ( Wako , #197–10033 ) , 50 mM sodium citrate , 50 mM sodium phosphate , pH 5 . 0 ) in the presence or absence of 2 mM Conduritol B epoxide ( Toronto Research Chemicals , #C666000 ) in a total volume of 100 μl at 37°C for 4 hr . The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 0 . 4 M glycine , pH 10 . 8 , and the fluorescence at 460 nm ( emission 355 nm ) was measured with Fluoroskan Ascent FL ( Thermo Fisher ) . Medaka brains were stored at—80°C until analyses and homogenized in 1 ml tissue homogenization buffer ( 250 mM sucrose , 25 mM KCl , 50 mM Tris-HCl , 0 . 5 mM EDTA , pH 7 . 4 ) . Aliquots containing 1 mg protein were used for the analyses . Levels of glucocerebroside and galactocerebroside were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem MS as described with modification using SFC separation[59] . A synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 90–104 of medaka α-syn conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin was used for immunization of rabbits . Serum was obtained 49 days after immunization and purified with affinity chromatography . Frozen and paraffin sections were used for immunohistochemical analyses . For frozen sections , medaka brains were fixed with 4% ( w/v ) paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) in phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS ) at 4°C for 4 hr and then placed in 30% ( w/v ) sucrose at 4°C for more than 16 hr . Samples were embedded in Surgipath FSC 22 ( Leica ) , and 14-μm-thick sections were obtained with a LEICA CM 1900 . For paraffin sections , medaka brains were fixed in 4% ( w/v ) PFA at 4°C for 16 hr , dehydrated , and embedded in paraffin .

For immunohistochemical analyses , the following primary antibodies and a lectin were used: anti-Cathepsin D ( Calbiochem , #IM03 , 1:200 ) , anti-GFAP ( Sigma-Aldrich , #G3893 , 1:1000 ) , anti-LC3 ( Santa Cruz , #sc-16755 , 1:100 ) , anti-medaka α-syn ( 1:2000 ) , anti-p62 ( MBL , #PM045 , 1:2000 ) , anti-ssDNA ( DAKO , #A4506 , 1:2000 ) , anti-TH ( Millipore , #MAB318 , 1:1000 ) , anti-TPH ( Abcam , #ab3907–50 , 1:1000 ) , anti-ubiquitin ( Santa Cruz , #sc-8017 , 1:50 ) , anti-ubiquitin ( DAKO , #Z0458 , 1:1000 ) , and biotinylated Lycopersicon Esculentum ( Tomato ) Lectin ( VECTOR , #B-1175 , 5 <g/ml ) . The sections were incubated at 4°C with primary antibodies or lectin for 1 to 3 days and then processed for visualization . As secondary antibodies , ImmPRESS ( VECTOR ) was used for diaminobenzidine staining , and Alexa Fluor-conjugated antibodies ( Molecular Probes ) were used for immunofluorescence . Sections were observed with an Olympus CX41 microscope , a BZ-9000 fluorescence microscope ( KEYENCE ) , and an Olympus FV-1000 confocal laser scanning microscope . For confocal microscope images , Pearson's coefficient correlation ( r ) was calculated using Olympus software . RNA was extracted from medaka brains with Qiazol ( QIAGEN ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . cDNA was generated with reverse transcription using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit ( Perfect Real Time ) ( TaKaRa , #RR037A ) . The amount of cDNA was quantified with real-time PCR using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master ( Roche , #04887352001 ) and Roche LightCycler 480 . The following primer sets were used ( TNFα: 5′-ATTGGAGTGAAAGGCCAGAA-3′ , 5′-ACTAATTTGAGACCGCCACG-3′; β-actin: 5′-TCCACCTTCCAGCAGATGTG-3′ , 5′-AGCATTTGCGGTGGACGAT-3′ ) . The vector including a portion of the medaka APOE cDNA sequence was generously provided by Dr . H . Mitani ( Tokyo University , Tokyo , Japan ) ( in submission ) . In situ hybridization was performed as described[60] . Counterstaining was performed with methyl green ( Sigma-Aldrich , #M8884 ) . For Triton-soluble fractions , samples were homogenized in high-salt buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 ( 750 mM NaCl , 5 mM EDTA , 50 mM Tris-HCl , 1% ( v/v ) Triton X-100 , pH 7 . 5 ) and centrifuged at 20 , 400 ×g at 4°C for 5 min . For SDS-soluble fractions , the pellet was subsequently sonicated in SDS buffer ( 50 mM Tris-HCl , 2% SDS , pH 7 . 4 ) followed by centrifugation at 20 , 400 ×g at 4°C for 5 min . The supernatant was boiled in sample buffer ( 1% ( w/v ) SDS , 12 . 5% ( w/v ) glycerol , 0 . 005% ( w/v ) bromophenol blue , 2 . 5% ( v/v ) 2-mercaptoethanol , 25 mM Tris-HCl , pH 6 . 8 ) . Samples were separated on 10% , 12% , or 14% ( w/v ) gels for SDS-PAGE . Samples containing 20 μg protein were loaded in each lane for Triton-soluble fractions , and SDS-soluble fractions were loaded according to the amount of protein in Triton-soluble fractions . Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes with a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell ( Bio-Rad ) . For detection of medaka α-syn and mouse α-syn , the membranes were treated with 0 . 4% ( w/v ) PFA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature before blocking to prevent detachment of α-syn from the blotted membranes[61] . For western blot analyses , the following primary antibodies were used: anti-β-actin ( Sigma-Aldrich , #A1978 , 1:5000 ) , anti-GFAP ( Sigma-Aldrich , #G3893 , 1:1000 ) , anti-LC3 ( MBL , #PM036 , 1:2000 ) , anti-NSE ( DAKO , #M0873 , 1:500 ) , anti-α-syn ( BD Transduction , #610787 , 1:2000 ) , anti-medaka α-syn ( 1:10 , 000 ) , anti-phosphorylated neurofilament ( COVANCE , #smi-31r , 1:1000 ) , anti-p62 ( MBL , #PM045 , 1:500 ) , anti-TH ( Millipore , #MAB318 , 1:1000 ) , and anti-ubiquitin ( Santa Cruz , #sc-8017 , 1:50 ) . The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 to 3 days at 4°C , followed by reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies ( Santa Cruz ) for 1 hr at room temperature . Immunoreactive bands were detected with Chemi-Lumi One Super ( Nacalai tesque ) , and the chemiluminescent signal was detected with Fujifilm LAS-3000 . Densitometric analyses were performed using ImageJ software ( National Institutes of Health ) . To measure the amounts of dopamine , noradrenaline and serotonin in medaka brains , high performance liquid chromatography was performed as described[60] . Medaka brains were fixed with 4% ( w/v ) PFA and 2% ( v/v ) glutaraldehyde ( Wako , #072–01961 ) in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer ( PB ) at 4°C for 16 hr . After rinsing in 0 . 1 M PB , samples were postfixed with 1% ( w/v ) OsO4 in 0 . 1 M PB for 2 hr . Then , samples were dehydrated , penetrated with ethanol and a propylene oxide series , and embedded in Epon . Sections were obtained with an EM UC6 ultramicrotome ( Leica ) . Sections with a thickness of 1 μm were used for toluidine blue staining . Sections with a thickness of 60 to 80 nm were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed with a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope . Immunoelectron microscopy using ultrathin cryosections was performed as described[62] . Briefly , brains were quickly removed from medaka and immersed in 4% PFA buffered with 0 . 1 M PB ( pH 7 . 2 ) at 4°C for 2 hr , washed thoroughly with 7 . 5% sucrose in 0 . 1 M PB ( pH 7 . 2 ) , and embedded in 12% gelatin . The samples were rotated in 2 . 3 M sucrose in 0 . 1 M PB overnight at 4°C , placed on a specimen holder ( Leica Microsystems ) , and quickly plunged into liquid nitrogen . Ultrathin cryosections were cut with a Leica UC6/FC6 and UC7/FC7 ( Leica Microsystems ) at about—120°C . Sections about 60 nm thick were picked up with a 1:1 mixture of 2% methylcellulose and 2 . 3 M sucrose and transferred to a nickel grid with a carbon-coated Formvar supporting film . The sections were rinsed with PBS containing 0 . 02 M glycine , treated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS , and incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-medaka α-syn antibody ( 1:30 ) . They were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold particles ( 1:40 ) ( British Biocell International ) for 1 hr at room temperature . Immunostained sections were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS . After completion of the labeling , the sections were embedded in a thin layer of 2% methylcellulose with 0 . 4% uranyl acetate ( pH 4 . 0 ) , air-dried , and observed with a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope . For control experiments , ultrathin sections were reacted only with the gold particle-conjugated secondary antibody . A two-tailed paired Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test was used for analyses .

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Functional rearrangements in biomolecular assemblies result from diffusion across an underlying energy landscape . While bulk kinetic measurements rely on discrete state-like approximations to the energy landscape , single-molecule methods can project the free energy onto specific coordinates . With measures of the diffusion , one may establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape . We used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome ( 2 . 1 million atoms; 1 . 3 microseconds ) to provide this bridge for specific conformational events associated with the process of tRNA translocation . Starting from a pre-translocation configuration , we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function . Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation were then used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape . This analysis , in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation , provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation . While this analysis was performed for a particular kinetic scheme of translocation , the quantitative framework is general and may be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states . \\n Biological machines are ubiquitous in the cell and typically contain many molecules that include protein , RNA , and other cofactors . Each molecule provides a unique contribution to an assembly's energy landscape , which then governs the machine's function . Accordingly , quantifying the landscape's features and molecular origins may allow one to precisely manipulate the physical-chemical properties that dictate the biological dynamics . Despite the pressing need for a quantitative description of the energy landscapes that underpin function , most experimental techniques report on the rates of interconversion between states , where each state is a discretized approximation to an energetic basin . To bridge discrete and continuous descriptions for a molecular machine , such as the ribosome , it is necessary to quantify the diffusive properties of functionally-relevant collective rearrangements . The observed , or effective , diffusion of each component of a biomolecular complex is determined by the intrinsic diffusion of that component ( free in solution ) as well as the short-scale energetic roughness that is introduced by molecular interfaces [1]–[5] . In other words , the landscape is characterized by energetic barriers that are associated with a hierarchy of length scales ( Fig . 1 ) [6] , [7] , where the effective diffusion is dictated by the magnitude of the short length-scale roughness . Structural rearrangements may then be described by effective ( short length-scale averaged ) diffusion on a smooth , large-scale , energy landscape . By measuring the effective diffusion , one may determine the relationship between the long length-scale free-energy barriers and the kinetics associated with interconversion between well-defined states . The ribosome has long been considered to function as a “thermal ratchet machine” [8] , in that random energetic fluctuations that result from finite temperatures lead to large-scale diffusive ( i . e . Brownian ) configurational rearrangements . While smFRET and simulations directly monitor diffusive movement across the landscape , kinetic and structural measures utilize discrete state-like approximations to describe a molecule's dynamics . These seemingly disparate perspectives can be rationalized by adopting energy landscape theory [9] , [10] , which was developed in the context of protein folding and then extended to describe functional dynamics [11]–[15] . To this end , we have combined all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and principles from energy landscape theory to provide the quantities necessary to describe large-scale collective dynamics in the ribosome . To achieve this , we analyzed the dynamics of an explicit-solvent simulation of an intact ribosome to identify groups of residues that undergo collective rotations/displacements . From this , we identified collective reaction coordinates that capture 30S-body rotation ( i . e . “ratchet-like” motion ) , 30S-head swivel and tRNA displacements ( Fig . 2 and 3 ) , which are essential motions during substrate translocation ( i . e . the directional movement of tRNA and mRNA molecules , with respect to the ribosomal subunits; described in detail in Text S1 ) [16] , [17] . In a continuous 1 . 3 microsecond explicit-solvent simulation of the pre-translocation complex , frequent small-scale body-rotation , head-swiveling and tRNA fluctuations were observed , from which effective diffusion coefficients were calculated in each coordinate space ( Fig . 4 ) . Full body and head rotation during translocation encompass angular displacements of and [18]–[23] . Smaller net rotations ( and ) were observed in the simulation . Dynamics of the pre-translocation complex provided quantitative measures of the short time-scale ( 10–100 ns ) fluctuations and effective diffusion in each space , which were used to relate the kinetics and free-energy barriers of translocation . From this analysis , we provide experimentally-grounded upper bounds for the long length-scale barriers associated with translocation , as well as estimates for the magnitude of the short-scale energetic roughness . \\n To quantify the energy landscape of translocation , it is necessary to identify coordinates that are able to accurately capture these motions ( which encompass large-scale rotary movement of the subunits ) . Structural approaches , such as x-ray spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy ( cryo-EM ) , provide snapshots of the ribosome that describe the average configurations of energetic minima . These structural models provide tremendous insights into the global architecture of biomolecular assemblies , though the models can not separate fluctuations that are due to movement of individual residues from many-residue collective rearrangements . For example , x-ray and cryo-EM models have shown that the 30S subunit rotates relative to the 50S subunit [18]–[23] . From structural models of the endpoints , one may be inclined to think that movement is rigid-body like , since rigid atomic models may fit well to the endpoint configurations . However , biomolecular systems are constantly subject to energetic fluctuations that arise from the surrounding solvent [24] , [25] , leading to heterogeneous distributions of atomic fluctuations . Accordingly , some regions exhibit fluctuations in the coordinates that are faster than ( and not coupled to ) the global rearrangements [26] . Here , we use all-atom explicit-solvent simulations to ask: For tRNA translocation in the ribosome , can we decompose the process into a superposition of slow , large-scale collective movements and rapid local fluctuations ? If so , what regions of the ribosome undergo each class of motions ? As described below , we find that many residues undergo coordinated displacements , which are reminiscent of rigid body movement . In addition to the coordinated movement of these “rigid” groups , roughly half of the rRNA residues undergo independent fluctuations . These peripheral fluctuations are likely linked to functional capabilities and control of the ribosome , which may include the movement of ribosomal “stalks” during elongation [27]–[33] , regulation of tRNA association and movement [34]–[38] , antibiotic function [39] and ribosomal stalling [40] . To probe the energy landscape of 30S body and head rotation and tRNA displacements , we first identified reaction coordinates upon which to project the free energy . For an appropriate coordinate ( here , , , and ) , the potential of mean force ( pmf ) captures the scale and position of the multidimensional free-energy barrier . Then , , where and are the probability distribution and free energy , as functions of . In order to describe body and head rotation as effective diffusion along an energy surface , each reaction coordinate was required to satisfy the following minimal set of conditions: 1 ) for each biomolecular configuration , is uniquely defined; 2 ) is a continuous function of the molecular coordinates; 3 ) collective rearrangements are measured by and independent fluctuations of individual atoms are not; 4 ) movement between the endpoints of translocation leads to changes in , while orthogonal displacements do not; 5 ) the endpoints and the transition state ensembles ( TSEs ) correspond to distinguishable values of ; and 6 ) the dynamics in -space is diffusive . In addition to these conditions , it would be desirable to also demonstrate that the dynamics along each coordinate is Markovian , and that the theoretical free-energy profile and diffusion coefficient ( possibly coordinate-dependent ) yield a rate that is consistent with the same simulated trajectory . While that form of analysis is computationally tractable for the folding of small proteins [41]–[46] , it is not yet feasible for systems as large as the ribosome . However , as computational capacity [47] and methods [48] continue to develop , it may soon be possible to perform comparable analysis for large system . Nonetheless , at this point , we use the remaining conditions to provide evidence of the suitability for a specific set of coordinates for translocation , with which the relationship between barriers and kinetics are calculated . Since and are continuous functions of the atomic coordinates , conditions 1 and 2 are met . Conditions 3–5 were ensured through analysis of an explicit-solvent simulation , crystallographic models and atomic models of cryo-EM reconstructions ( Fig . 3; see Methods and Text S1 ) . As discussed below , in the simulation , movement along and is diffusive in character , indicating that point 6 is also satisfied . ( called elsewhere ) was previously shown to satisfy these considerations [49] . Together , these calculations provide systematically-identified coordinates for describing the diffusive body-rotation , head-swivel and tRNA displacements that occur during translocation . To construct coordinates for 30S body and head rotation ( and ) that measure collective rotations and not the fluctuations of individual atoms , we first identified groups of residues within each subunit that undergo minimal ( 1 Å ) internal structural fluctuations . This was accomplished through an iterative-exclusion strategy ( See Methods ) that is based on the spatial root-mean-squared fluctuations ( rmsf ) of each residue ( Fig . 3A ) . Consistent with previous calculations [27]–[31] , [50] and experimental measurements [51] , large portions of the ribosome were relatively immobile in the simulation ( i . e . small internal rearrangements ) , whereas peripheral regions underwent rapid , larger-scale structural fluctuations . Of the 2903 residues in the 23S rRNA of the 50S subunit , we identified 1353 residues as scaffolding , or “core , ” residues . Similarly , in the 16S rRNA of the 30S subunit , of the 1060 30S-body residues considered , 443 were identified as being part of the core . Of the 284 30S-head residues considered , 178 were identified as core residues ( Figs . 3 and S1; see Text S1 for list of residues ) . Consistent with our identification of the core residues , many have small anisotropic crystallographic B-factors [52] , which measure the mobility of each atom [53] . A noticeable exception is the elevated B-factors of the 30S-head residues ( Fig . S2 ) . This may be attributed to the fact that the B-factors measure the total dispersion in the coordinates , where relative displacements of domains can elevate the B-factors , even if each domain is internally rigid . In the case of the 30S-head region , uncertainties in the relative orientation of the head , relative to the 30S body and the 50S are likely to elevate the B-factors . Through simulation , we avoid this effect by calculating the relative mobility of subsets of residues , which specifically isolates the internal fluctuations of each region . Analysis of the fluctuations of each subregion ( 50S , 30S-body and 30S-head ) indicates that large sets of atoms within each subunit maintain their structural integrity while the core group undergoes displacements relative to other subunits . Accordingly , the configurations of the cores residues were analyzed for a variety of experimental structural models , in order to identify the vectors of rotation that define and ( Fig . 3; See Methods ) . Rather than measure the relative orientation of a single pairs of atoms in each model , which would be susceptible to the local fluctuations of each atom , collective rearrangement of each subunit was measured by first finding the average orientation of the core residues in each model . That is , even if every atom fluctuates in Cartesian space with the same length scale , the projection onto the coordinates would depend on the distance between the atom pair used . Individual atomic fluctuations would then have differential effects on the rotation fluctuations , if the averaging step were not employed . To obtain the average , a reference model was fit to the core residues of each structural model . The rotation vector was then defined by finding the atom pair ( within the rigid , fitted models ) that has a maximal difference in angle between functional configurations ( See Methods and Text S1 for details ) . With the rotation vectors identified , the rotation angles may be calculated for any experimental or computationally-generated configuration of the ribosome . Here , we provide the values of and for a variety of available x-ray and cryo-EM models ( Table S1 ) , as well as for each frame of our simulated trajectory ( 10 ps intervals ) . With the rotation angles calculated for each simulated frame , we next asked if the dynamics in these coordinate spaces is diffusive , or not . We found that the rotation coordinates and tRNA coordinate exhibit diffusive behavior ( Fig . 4B/D ) , supporting their use as reaction coordinates for translocation . The displacement-squared along each coordinate scales linearly with time , at long time , such that effective diffusion coefficients along each can be obtained from the relation: ( 1 ) where indicates an average over all simulated frames that are separated by a given value of , and is the timescale associated with diffusive movement ( i . e . where becomes linear ) . After an initial burst phase ( 30 ns , Fig . S3 ) , and exhibit linear behavior , with linear correlation coefficients ( c . c . ) of 0 . 97 and 0 . 98 . Similarly , after an initial burst phase of 10 ns , follows a linear trend ( Fig . 4D ) , where c . c . = 0 . 99 . This linear behavior is characteristic of diffusive dynamics , where the slopes of each fit indicate = 1 . 39 degrees , = 2 . 95 degrees and . For discussion on uncertainties in , see Text S1 . In our previous analysis of tRNA diffusion during accommodation [49] , we used Eq . 1 to calculate , and compared it to the values obtained using a quasi-harmonic approximation , which accounts for the local curvature of each free-energy basin [54] . When using Eq . 1 , the obtained diffusion coefficients were smaller ( 1/2 ) than those using the quasi-harmonic approximation [49] . One explanation for the attenuated values when using Eq . 1 is that the local curvature of the basin can reduce growth of at long time . That is , as the system samples higher free-energy configurations , it eventually is thermodynamically favorable to return to the minimum . This can lead to decreased values of at large , which would be associated with smaller values of . While it would be beneficial to directly compare the two approaches , in addition to other proposed methods [41]–[46] , the current data set is not sufficient for such comparisons . Additionally , and do not appear to fluctuate about a single well-defined energetic minimum ( Fig . 4 ) during the course of the simulation , thus the quasi-harmonic approximation is not expected to provide reliable estimates for the present data set . Taken together , these considerations suggest that the diffusion coefficients reported here may be lower-bound estimates for the effective diffusion coefficients for 30S-body and 30S-head rotation . Effective diffusion coefficients describe the short length-scale energetic roughness [1]–[3] , allowing us to infer the energetic character of the landscape at different functional stages . The scale of the local energetic roughness relates the effective diffusion and the diffusion of a free molecule , according to the relation: ( 2 ) We find that for the classical A/A-P/P-configured tRNAs , which is consistent with previously reported values [49] . However , it is significantly lower than for the A/T-configured tRNA molecule ( i . e . the configuration in which aminoacyl-tRNA is delivered to the ribosome ) , where ( nearly identical to the free diffusion in solution ) . This suggests that the energetic roughness increases as a tRNA molecule enters the ribosome and reaches a value of ( kcal/mol ) as it maneuvers through the interior of the particle . While we consider these values of the diffusion to be initial estimates , additional considerations suggest the presented values are reliable measures . First , the diffusive regime for each coordinate is reached at lag times ( ) of ns . Since this is far faster than the full-scale rotations implicated during translocation ( milliseconds ) , these measures of describe shorter-scale processes and should not be heavily influenced by large-scale barrier crossing processes . Second , in the course of the simulation , there does not appear to be a strongly-preferred orientation of the domains . This suggests that the energetic basin of attraction associated with the classical configuration is not sharply defined . As discussed above , the local curvature may have an impact on . However , the absence of a well-defined minimum would suggest that this effect will be small . In other words , the diffusive time-regime is far shorter than the timescale associated with barrier-crossing attempts ( see next section ) . Finally , the obtained diffusion coefficients do not differ significantly when only the first half , or second half , of the simulated data is used for analysis ( Fig . S4 ) , each of which samples different ranges of and . The two halves also provide similar values of , which would make it surprising if there is a strong coordinate-dependence in the vicinity of the classical configuration . Since the presented analysis indicates that , and capture diffusive aspects of ribosome dynamics , we will use them to relate the free-energy barriers and kinetics associated with translocation-related structural rearrangements . The rates of body rotation , head-swiveling , and tRNA displacements are related to the underlying free energy according to [2] , [3]: ( 3 ) where is , or . is the short-length scale averaged free energy as a function of each coordinate . is the effective diffusion coefficient in -space . Here , we simplify the integral by treating as a constant for each transition . While the diffusion may vary along each coordinate , the extent to which changes will be determined by the magnitude of the short-length scale roughness along each . Since the types of chemical interactions ( i . e . protein-RNA , or RNA-RNA interactions ) are similar during each rearrangement , including at the subunit bridges [21] , it is not expected that the coordinate dependence will be large for subunit rotation . To emphasize this point , it is instructive to consider protein folding studies , where coordinate-dependent diffusion has been detected through a variety of computational and experimental methods [41]–[46] , [55]–[58] . During protein folding , the polymer chain transits from an unfolded state , which is dominated by protein-solvent interactions , to a folded ensemble that is composed of protein-protein interaction . Despite this drastic change in the local chemical environment during folding , most studies have reported only modest changes in ( factors of 2–5 ) . In the present study of the ribosome , there are not large changes in the chemical composition of the subunit interfaces , making it reasonable to expect that the scale of the energetic roughness will not change significantly during each rearrangement . Nonetheless , since it is possible that there will be coordinate dependence , the presented estimates of should be considered baseline estimates . As the coordinate-dependence of the diffusion is characterized , the presented calculations may be further refined to provide a more precise relationship between the free energy and the kinetics . With the calculated values of , through numerical integration ( See Methods ) we calculated the rates of the rearrangements ( body and head rotation and tRNA displacements ) as functions of the barrier heights ( Fig . 5A–C ) . The rate of translocation has been reported to be , depending on the experimental conditions used [59]–[64] . By definition , each substep of translocation must be faster than the full process . Thus , our analysis indicates that the barriers for each substep are unlikely to exceed ( Fig . 5 ) . Diffusion leads to free-energy barrier-crossing attempts and the barrier height determines the probability of successfully crossing [1]–[3] , [49] , [57] , [65] . For a two-state transition ( i . e . two energetic basins separated by a single barrier ) the rate may be approximated in terms of an attempt frequency and free-energy barrier : , where and are the free energy of the initial ensemble and the TSE . is process-specific . For example , biomolecular folding is associated with prefactors of [1] , [57] , [66] , while simulations suggest attempt frequencies for tRNA accommodation of ( Ref . [49] ) . Similarly , the calculated values of and suggest that and ( Fig . 5 , is used for comparison ) . For tRNA displacements that occur during hybrid-state formation and translocation , suggests . It is notable that the values of are comparable for all three processes , even though they take place in distinct coordinate spaces and have unique values of . That is , the attempt frequencies are the result of both the magnitude of the diffusion , and the length scale of the rearrangement ( Eq . 3 ) . For these processes , the large rearrangements are accompanied by larger values for the diffusion , which leads to comparable attempt frequencies . In contrast , the attempt frequency for tRNA accommodation was found to be larger than for tRNA displacements associated with translocation . Since these processes occur on similar length-scales , this difference highlights the contribution of the diffusion coefficient to the attempt frequency . These similarities and differences between the attempt frequencies in each space demonstrate the balance between length scale , energetic roughness , diffusion and the free-energy barriers of conformational transitions in the ribosome . \\n The ability to rigorously interconvert between the energy landscape and kinetics will be essential in order to unambiguously quantify the features of the biomolecular landscapes that underpin function . With knowledge of the diffusive properties , theoretical and experimental probes of the energy landscape may be directly compared to kinetic measurements , which will enable a comprehensive picture of the landscape to emerge . Thus , the diffusion provides a unifying foundation for understanding and interpreting all available data for a given biological process . In the presented study , we have made the first steps towards establishing such a framework for tRNA translocation in the ribosome . To do this , we probed the diffusive characteristics of subunit rotations and tRNA displacements , essential sub-processes that facilitate protein elongation in the cell . As computer hardware continues to increase in power , and new computational algorithms and models are developed , the current study will provide the context for understanding a gamut of biophysical measurements and predictions . Of particular interest are the detailed features of the underlying energy landscape , as well as the robustness of ribosome dynamics to external perturbations . Similar to macroscopic machines , by understanding the interplay between the moving parts of these systems , it may be possible to design strategies to exploit this knowledge and provide precise regulation of biomolecular dynamics in the cell . In such efforts , the presented approach for bridging kinetics and free-energies provides a way to systematically verify predictions about the landscape against experimental data . These tools allow us to integrate complementary information from experimental and computational techniques , which will be crucial when identifying the features of the energy landscapes that govern biological function . \\n The simulation is a direct continuation of our previous 100 ns explicit-solvent simulation of the ribosome [67] . The simulation is based on the high resolution crystallographic structure of an E . coli ribosome in a pre-translocation ( classical A/A-P/P ) configuration ( PDB ID: 2I2P and 2I2T . [68] ) . The simulation was performed on 2048 ( on NMCAC Encanto ) and 1024 ( on TACC Lonestar ) compute cores using Gromacs v4 . 5 . 3 [69] , [70] , with a peak performance of 15 nanoseconds/day . The AMBER99p force field [71] , [72] was employed . [KCl] = 100 mM and , yielding 388 , 6272 and 2831 ions . 602587 SPC/E water molecules were included , for a total system size of 2070120 atoms . A 1 . 3 microsecond production run was performed with the Verlet integration scheme [73] and a 2 femtosecond time step . The NPT ensemble was sampled , where the system was coupled to a temperature bath of 300 K through use of the Nosé-Hoover thermostat [74] , [75] . Pressure coupling was achieved through employment of the Berendsen algorithm , with a pressure of 1 bar , relaxation time of 2 . 5 picoseconds , and compressibility of 4 . 5 [76] . While the choice of thermostat and barostat could impact the observed kinetic properties , both operate by modulating average quantities . Due to the large number of atoms in this system , fluctuations in the average quantities ( such as average kinetic energy per atom ) will be relatively small , and the coupling baths should have only a marginal effect on the kinetics . Supporting this , previous simulations of the A/A-P/P configuration [49] that used an alternate thermal coupling algorithm provided effective diffusion coefficients for movement along that were similar to the values reported here . Covalent bonds were constrained using the LINCS algorithm [77] , while the cutoff distances for the van der Waals and Coulomb interactions were both chosen to be 0 . 9 nm . The long-range electrostatic interactions were treated by the PME algorithm [78] , with a tolerance of and an interpolation order of 4 . Complete details on equilibration , structural modeling and the initial configuration may be found elsewhere [67] . During translocation by the ribosome , there are multiple large-scale rotary motions that facilitate tRNA movement ( Fig . 2 ) . To probe the collective rotary motions of the subunits , and exclude independent fluctuations of individual residues , we identified sets of core residues for the 50S subunit , 30S body and 30S head . In doing so , we only considered the rRNA portions of each region . These regions undergo sub-Å internal displacements , allowing their average orientations to be used to measure body and head rotation . To identify the core residues , we started with sets of candidate residues and then iteratively excluded highly-fluctuating ones , until a set was identified for which the rmsf is less than 1 Å for every residue . The following protocol was employed: Upon completion of this iterative-exclusion algorithm , there were 1353 , 443 and 178 rRNA residues in the core groups of the 50S , 30S body and 30S head ( Figs . 3B , 3C and S1; See Text S1 for list of core residues ) . To define the coordinates for rotation ( and ) , the core residue configurations were compared for classical and rotated configurations of the ribosome . First , for each structural model ( classical , body-rotated , head-rotated ) , reference configurations of the core residues were spatially aligned to the 23S , 16S body and 16S head regions . This initial alignment provided an average orientation ( i . e . the “idealized” coordinates ) of each group , thereby ensuring that the rotation metrics probe the collective rotation of the groups and not the independent fluctuations of individual atom . Next , the idealized coordinates were compared for each structural model . Specifically , to define , all possible vectors that can be defined by two P atoms in were calculated for the classical and body-rotated configuration . The atom-pair vector that undergoes the largest change in angle was then used to define the rotation plane for . An analogous strategy was used to define . All scripts necessary to calculate these angles will be made available online , upon publication . For complete details , see Text S1 . With values of , , and the rates of body rotation , head rotation , and tRNA displacements were calculated from Eq . 3 . When , the lower bound on the inside integral is , otherwise it is . Consistent with previous studies [49] , we numerically integrated Eq . 3 through the use of free-energy surfaces that have the functional form ( Fig . S5 ) , where is the position of the free-energy barrier and and were set such that the endpoints are minima . Other functional forms were considered ( Fig . S6 ) , however , for sufficiently large barriers , the functional form does not have a sizable effect on the rate [65] . This point was also explicitly shown in Ref . [49] . Based on the analysis of cryo-EM and x-ray models ( See Table S1 ) , the bounds of integration corresponded to changes in each coordinate of ( ) , ( ) and 22 Å ( ) . As discussed in the Results , the simulation was performed at 300 K ( ) , whereas many experiments are performed at . Accordingly , the diffusion coefficients presented here are slightly lower that what should be used when interpreting experiments at higher temperatures . For other kinetic models for which experimental data may become available , the limits of integration may be modified , thus providing a quantitative bridge between the landscape and kinetics for other kinetic representations of translocation . As expected from the arguments of Kramers [3] , [57] , [65] , for a substantial free-energy barrier ( ) separating two free-energy minima , the mean first passage time may be approximated according to the relation: ( 4 ) where , and are the curvatures of the free-energy surface in the initial basin and the TSE , and and are the diffusion and free energy of the TSE . Accordingly , for any relatively smooth function that has a single , well-defined peak separating two fixed endpoints , the curvature of the basin and TSE will be within a relatively small range of values . In the present study , we employed a symmetric functional form for the barrier ( Fig . S5 ) , in order to calculate the relationship between the rates and the free-energy surface . Previously , we explicitly calculated the rates using alternate symmetric functional forms , and found the rates to be robust [49] . Here , we have additionally calculated the rates for asymmetric barriers ( Fig . S6 ) , which further highlights the robustness of the rates to the functional form . That is , for a barrier separating two basins of attraction by 15 distance units ( e . g . ) , the calculated rates only vary by a factor of up to two when the free-energy peak is centered at 3 , 7 . 5 , or 12 distance units . Accordingly , for a given rate , the effect of this feature will only alter the predicted barrier height by a maximum of .   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) is not yet fully understood , although some oncogenic mutations have been identified . To explore genetic profiles of MTCs , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2 . Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced . We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples . The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene , which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ) , serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ) , v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ) , mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ) , Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ) and MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ) . We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH . To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5’ fusion partner of ALK , customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients . Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusions were identified . Additional PCR analysis , followed by Sanger sequencing , confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion , indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion . Notably , a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor , crizotinib . In conclusion , we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC . Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors . Furthermore , the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy . \\n Many cancer gene profiling studies have recently been published , describing genetic trends that are not limited to specific cancers . Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) is an important tool for detecting genetic alterations in many kinds of cancers , as it allows for millions of nucleic acid sequences to be simultaneously sequenced within a short period of time and is more cost-effective than older methods . Thus , many researchers and physicians anticipate that NGS will bring the concept of personalized cancer therapy to fruition . Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) is a rare malignancy that accounts for up to 3–5% of thyroid cancers . It is derived from calcitonin-secreting para-follicular C cells and can arise in a familial ( 25% ) or sporadic ( 75% ) pattern . Genetic and epigenetic alterations play important roles in the progression and prognosis of MTC [1–3] . Genes encoding the ret proto-oncogene ( RET ) and Ras ( RAS ) are commonly mutated in MTC [4 , 5] . The RET mutation is believed to be a causative event in both familial and sporadic MTC [6 , 7] . In the Mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway , the RAS mutation is another genetic rearrangement that is prevalent in sporadic MTC and other types of thyroid cancer [2] but the prevalence and significance of other genetic mutations including BRAF in MTC remain unclear . MTC has a different response to treatment than that of well-differentiated thyroid cancers . Because radioactive iodine does not accumulate in MTC , few therapeutic options are available for advanced MTC . Inhibitors of RET , such as cabozantinib and vandetanib , have recently been shown to be effective in advanced MTC [8 , 9] . However , whether the RET mutation is a predictive factor for the success of these drugs is unclear [9] . Recently , the rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) was detected in a small but significant proportion of patients with non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) [10] . Several ALK inhibitors , including crizotinib , have achieved dramatic responses in cases of NSCLC harboring ALK rearrangements [11–13] . Although ALK rearrangement has also been episodically observed in a small set of other cancer types , little is known about ALK rearrangements in MTC [14 , 15] . In this study , we used targeted NGS and various methods to examine the genetic profiles of MTC and detect ALK rearrangements . \\n Eighty-four samples ( 11 hereditary , 41 sporadic and 32 unknown ) from patients with MTC ( mean age of 48 . 5 years ) and 36 paired normal thyroid tissue samples were successfully sequenced . The normal thyroid tissue samples in the MTC patients were used as matched control samples . Of the cases , 32 were male and 52 were female . Detailed demographic , clinic-pathological and genetic characteristics are listed in Table 1 and S2 Table . Hereditary MTCs were defined as cases having either positive germ-line RET mutations in blood tests or possession of a strong family history with MTC in at least four family members [16] . The unknown group was composed of MTC cases with no blood RET test and no family history of MTC/MEN . The mean value of variant coverage was 593 reads , and the variant coverage ranged from 19 to 1 , 482 reads . Overall , 101 mutations were observed in the MTC samples . Most mutations ( N = 96 , 95 . 0% ) were single-nucleotide variants; 5 were deletions . The most common mutation occurred in RET , which was observed in 47 cases , followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ) , serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ) , v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ) , mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ) , Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ) , MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ) , ATM serine/threonine kinase ( N = 2 ) , kinase insert domain receptor ( N = 2 ) , adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC; N = 2 ) , B-raf proto-oncogene ( N = 1 ) , cadherin 1 ( N = 1 ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( N = 1 ) , cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A ( CDKN2A , N = 1 ) , Janus kinase 3 ( N = 1 ) , protein tyrosine phosphatase , non-receptor type 1 ( N = 1 ) , SMAD family member 4 ( N = 1 ) and von Hippel-Lundau tumor suppressor ( N = 1 ) . We did not detect any dominant gene mutations in 20 MTC samples , which all exhibited wild-type RET , HRAS and KRAS . These are listed in S1 Table and shown in Fig 1 . The commonly observed RET mutations occurred in exons 10 , 11 , 15 , and 16 . Previous studies have shown that M918T is the most common RET mutation in MTC [2 , 10] . Similarly , M918T ( N = 19 ) was the most common RET mutation in our samples , followed by C634Y ( N = 7 ) , C634W ( N = 4 ) , C634G ( N = 4 ) , C630R ( N = 4 ) , D631Y ( N = 2 ) , and others ( N = 7 ) . All HRAS mutations occurred in exon 3 . The mutant amino acid sequence in each of the HRAS mutant cases was Q61K ( N = 13 ) . KRAS mutations were observed in three cases ( Q61R , 2 and G48R , 1 ) , and BRAF mutation was found in only one case . The dominant amino acid sequence in STK11 was F354L ( N = 7 ) . Other mutated genes are shown in S1 Table . We compared the genetic landscapes between 36 MTC tissues and their matched normal thyroid tissues: this group was composed of 16 sporadic , 5 hereditary and 15 cases with unknown information about heredity ( Fig 2 ) . In the hereditary MTC cases , RET mutations were observed in MTC and their matched normal thyroid tissues: these RET mutation types included C634Y , D631Y , and C634W , which are well known to be associated with the MEN2A [17 , 18] . One case , which had been classified as an unknown subgroup based on blood test or family history , was found to have C634W mutation in both MTC and normal tissue , leading us to suspect that this case might be hereditary MTC . In 16 sporadic MTC group , several RET mutation types ( M918T , C630R , C618S and deletion ) were detected in MTC tissues , but not in the matched normal thyroid tissues . The M918T RET mutations and Q61K HRAS mutations were observed only in the MTCs of the sporadic or unknown subgroups , suggesting that these mutations are pathognomonic somatic mutation in MTC . In addition , two KRAS ( G48R , Q61R ) and one MET ( A986T ) mutations were also observed only in MTC tissues . However , STK11 ( F354L ) , MLH1 , KIT , and KDR mutations were observed in both MTC and normal thyroid tissues , which leads their pathognomonic natures unresolved in MTC . In parallel with targeted sequencing using AmpliSeq , we screened for ALK rearrangements . Ninety-eight cases were screened using immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , and 83 of these cases were also evaluated using AmpliSeq . Nine ALK-positive cases were found with IHC scores of 1+ ( N = 7 ) , 2+ ( N = 1 ) , and 3+ ( N = 1 ) . We also performed ALK fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) testing on ALK-positive samples that were identified via IHC . The two samples with 2+ and 3+ IHC scores exhibited ALK break-apart rearrangements ( Fig 3 ) . For the two cases harboring ALK break-apart rearrangements , targeted cancer panel sequencing ( HiSeq 2500 , Illumina , USA ) was performed to detect the breakpoints and 5’ fusion partner genes of ALK . This process revealed two distinct ALK fusions . For the first case , a novel fusion gene was detected: 5’ glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1; located in 2p13 ) was fused to 3’ ALK ( located in 2p23 ) with preservation of the ALK kinase domain ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . The breakpoints in GFPT1 and ALK were in intron 18 and exon 20 , respectively . Based on the gene direction and location , the structural variation was presumed to be intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion . To confirm the fusion , we amplified the genomic fusion point between GFPT1 and ALK using genomic DNA of the MTC tissue . PCR analysis and Sanger sequencing revealed the same results as that of the customized targeted cancer panel ( Figs 4B and S1 ) . For the second case , the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusion was detected . The breakpoints were located in intron 13 of EML4 and intron 19 of ALK , which indicates that this fusion is the most common variant ( E13; A20 ) in NSCLC [19 , 20] . This case exhibited metastatic lesions after thyroidectomy and was enrolled in a Phase I crizotinib trial ( NCT01121588 ) . After crizotinib therapy , the tumor lesions in the lung , liver , and bone shrank remarkably , and plasma calcitonin levels decreased . The final results will be disclosed with the full clinical study . \\n We identified two types of ALK fusion genes in MTC by sequencing via IHC , FISH , and NGS analyses . Of the two fusion types , the EML4-ALK fusion was the same as the most commonly detected variant in NSCLC , [19] where the EML4-ALK fusion is a strong predictive factor for the efficacy of ALK inhibitors [13 , 21 , 22] . In the current study , the patient with metastatic MTC harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to crizotinib . We are the first to report an MTC case with a targetable EML4-ALK fusion gene . Previously , Kelly et al . used the Illumina HiSeq sequencing system to identify one papillary thyroid cancer case with an EML4-ALK fusion [15] . However , they also tested 22 medullary carcinoma cases and did not find any cases with the EML4-ALK fusion , as evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR . Their failure to detect the ALK rearrangement in MTC is understandable , given that our prevalence rate of ALK fusions in the current study was only 2% ( 2 out of 98 cases ) . This suggests that more efficient strategies are needed to detect the ALK rearrangement . Results from the current study suggest that IHC-based screening , along with FISH-based confirmation and targeted NGS , may be a cost-effective and reliable method to detect ALK rearrangements . Most importantly , we detected a novel GFPT1-ALK fusion that has not been reported in any type of cancer . GFPT1 is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of N-acetylglucosamine and is required for critical events in neuromuscular transmission [23] . Until now , several fusion partners of ALK have been reported in various cancers [24–28] . Among them , huntingdon-interacting protein ( HIP1 ) -ALK and RAN-binding protein 2 ( RANBP2 ) -ALK , which have been reported to exist in NSCLC and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors , respectively , show clinical responses to crizotinib [25 , 26] . In the current study , the MTC case harboring the GFPT1-ALK fusion showed strong ALK protein expression and did not exhibit co-existing genetic mutations; both of these factors may support an important role for this fusion gene in the pathogenesis of this MTC case . However , we were unable to validate whether GFPT1-ALK was a driving oncogene or a therapeutically targetable gene . Whether GFPT1-ALK is also a predictor for ALK inhibitors is unclear . Currently , vandetanib and cabozantinib are approved for the treatment of MTC by the U . S . Food and Drug Administration . However , the prognosis of patients with metastatic MTC is still poor , due to the inherent resistance to radioiodine therapy and aggressive nature of this disease . Furthermore , the rarity of MTC makes it hard to perform prospective studies to find new agents . Therefore , the comprehensive genetic analysis of MTC can help to identify effective ways to improve its prognosis . Despite the low frequency of ALK rearrangements in MTC , our techniques can be used to detect target genes in other rare diseases . In addition , our sequencing analysis of MTC is the largest to date . Previously , Agrawal et al . published the largest genomic analysis of MTC [5] , where they performed whole-exome sequencing of 17 sporadic MTCs and 40 additional MTCs ( hereditary or sporadic ) for validation . RET was the dominant mutation ( 43/57 ) in that study . We used a larger sample size and accurate verification by comparing 36 pairs of MTC with matched normal thyroid tissues that were acquired from the same person . In the comparison analyses , all five hereditary cases were observed to have germ-line RET mutations in both MTC and control tissues . However , M918T RET ( N = 10 ) , Q61K HRAS ( N = 7 ) , KRAS ( N = 2 ) , and MET ( N = 1 ) mutations were harbored dominantly in MTCs . Simbolo et al . identified RET , HRAS , KRAS and STK11 mutations as significant somatic mutations in MTCs , whereas TP53 , KDR , KIT , MET , PIK3CA and ATM mutations were classified as nonpathogenic germ-line variants [29] . Our current data are compatible with that report . Interestingly , however , the F354L STK11 mutation , regarded as significant somatic mutation by Simbolo et al . , was observed in both MTCs and control tissues of our seven cases . Therefore , we presume that the F354L STK11 mutation is a germ-line mutation in MTC . In conclusion , we report that the EML4-ALK fusion , which was found for the first time in MTC , could be an effective molecular target of crizotinib . Furthermore , our results also suggest that the novel GFPT1-ALK fusion can be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy . This study included the largest set of molecular profile data in MTC to date , which was achieved by using high-depth NGS panel sequencing , and also presented the genetic landscape of MTC . Further translational research is needed to determine the oncogenic roles of these mutations in MTC . \\n Written informed consent was obtained from all participants , and this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center . ( SMC 2013-02-010 ) . We collected data on patients who were histologically diagnosed with MTC without the coexistence of tumors on the parathyroid and adrenal gland . All patients received surgical treatment at Samsung Medical Center between June 2000 and January 2013 . Among 101 MTC specimens , 17 were excluded based on quality control ( N = 5 ) , preparation failure ( N = 11 ) , and sequencing failure ( N = 1 ) . The remaining 84 MTC samples were sequenced using an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine ( IT-PGM , Life Technologies , Grand Island , NY , USA ) , which takes real-time measurements of hydrogen ions that are produced during DNA replication and allows for rapid sequencing . Eight normal thyroid tissues were obtained by thyroidectomy and sequenced . Mutation profiles between MTC and normal thyroid tissues from eight individuals were compared . We constructed libraries using the Ion AmpliSeq Panels , Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit , and Ion Xpress Barcodes , as well as 10 ng of DNA sample per pool ( Life Technologies ) . The amplicons were ligated to Ion Adapters and purified . For barcoded library preparations , barcoded adapters from the Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters 1–96 Kit were substituted for the non-barcoded adapter mix in the Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit . Next , the multiplexed barcoded libraries were enriched by clonal amplification using emulsion polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) on Ion Sphere Particles ( Ion PGM Template 200 Kit ) and loaded on an Ion 316 Chip . Massively parallel sequencing was carried out on an Ion PGM using the Ion PGM Sequencing 200 Kit v2 . The Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 covered hotspot regions of 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes . The primary filtering process was performed with the Torrent Suite v4 . 0 . 0 and Ion Torrent Variant Caller v4 . 0 software and included signal processing , base calling , assigning quality scores , adapter trimming , PCR duplicate removal , read alignment ( to human genome reference 19 ) , mapping quality control , coverage analyzing , and variant calling [30] . To detect variants , a minimum coverage of 100 reads was achieved with a cutoff value of at least 5% in the variant calling rate ( frequency ) . Variant calls were further analyzed by using ANNOVAR variant filtering and COSMIC database ( dbSNP build 137 ) annotating , and these analyses were based on changes in the amino acid sequence . The ALK IHC assay used a mouse monoclonal ALK antibody ( 5A4 , Novocastra , Newcastle , United Kingdom ) and the antibody for ALK was diluted to 1:30 , treated , and incubated at 42°C for 2 hours . ALK IHC scores were assigned as follows: 0 , no staining; 1+ , faint or weak staining intensity with more than 5% tumor cells or any staining intensity with ≤5% tumor cells; 2+ , moderate cytoplasmic reactivity with more than 5% tumor cells; and 3+ , granular cytoplasmic reactivity of strong intensity in more than 5% of tumor cells [31] . Cases that showed ALK-positive staining with a score of 1+ or greater were analyzed by FISH with the Vysis ALK Break-Apart FISH Probe Kit ( Abbott Laboratories , Abbott Park , IL ) . Samples were considered positive for ALK FISH if more than 15% of cells were positive or an isolated red signal ( IRS ) in tumor cells . Genomic DNA extraction was performed using the QIAamp DNA mini kit ( Qiagen , Valencia , CA , USA ) , according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The Nanodrop 8000 UV-Vis spectrometer ( Thermo Scientific Inc . , DE , USA ) , Qubit 2 . 0 Fluorometer ( Life Technologies ) , and 2200 TapeStation Instrument ( Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA , USA ) were used to check the concentration , purity , and degradation of extracted genomic DNA . For the next step , samples that passed our quality control thresholds were used . Genomic DNA ( 250 ng ) from the tissues was sheared by the Covaris S220 ( Covaris , Woburn , MA , USA ) and used for the construction of the library using customized RNA baits and the SureSelect XT reagent kit , HSQ ( Agilent Technologies ) , according to the manufacturer’s protocol . The customized RNA baits covered whole exons and flanking intronic sequences of the 83 genes . After enriched exome libraries were multiplexed , the libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 sequencing platform ( Illumina , USA ) , as described previously [32] . Briefly , a paired-end DNA sequencing library was prepared through the following processes: genomic DNA shearing , end-repair , A-tailing , paired-end adaptor ligation , and amplification . After the library was hybridized with bait sequences for 16 hours , the captured library was purified and amplified with an index barcode tag . Then , the quality and quantity of the captured library were measured . Sequencing of the exome library was carried out using the 100-bp , paired-end mode of the TruSeq Rapid PE Cluster kit and TruSeq Rapid SBS kit ( Illumina , San Diego , CA , USA ) . The newly identified glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK fusion gene was detected by targeted cancer panel sequencing , and its respective genomic rearrangement was confirmed by genomic PCR analysis , followed by Sanger sequencing . Genomic DNA was isolated from formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor samples using a ReliaPrep FFPE genomic DNA extraction kit ( Promega , Madison , WI , USA ) . The PCR products were indicative of fusion points within intron 18 of GFPT1 and exon 20 of ALK , based on target sequencing results . PCR analysis of genomic DNA for GFPT1-ALK was performed with a pair of primers flanking the putative fusion point: GFPT1 F ( 5’-TCTGTGTGAACTGGCACCTT-3’ ) and ALK R ( 5’-ATTCAGCCCCTACACTGCAC-3’ ) . PCR products were then separated on a 2% E-Gel SizeSelect agarose gel ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . For genomic PCR controls , we used DNA from the same FFPE tumor samples with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR primers . In reactions that produced a PCR product of the expected size , the amplicons underwent gel purification and sequencing using a 3130 XL ABI Prism sequencer ( Applied Biosystems , Foster City , CA , USA ) with Bigdye Terminator v3 . 1 Cycle sequencing kits , according to the manufacturer’s instructions .   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Asymptomatic leishmaniasis may drive the epidemic and an important challenge to reach the goal of joint Visceral Leishmaniasis ( VL ) elimination initiative taken by three Asian countries . The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission , prognosis at individual level and rate of transformation to symptomatic VL/Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) needs to be evaluated . Asymptomatic cases were diagnosed by active mass survey in eight tribal villages by detecting antileishmanial antibody using rK39 based rapid diagnostic kits and followed up for three years to observe the pattern of sero-conversion and disease transformation . Out of 2890 total population , 2603 were screened . Antileishmanial antibody was detected in 185 individuals of them 96 had a history of VL/PKDL and 89 without such history . Seventy nine such individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis and ten as active VL with a ratio of 7 . 9:1 . Out of 79 asymptomatic cases 2 were lost to follow up as they moved to other places . Amongst asymptomatically infected persons , disease transformation in 8/77 ( 10 . 39% ) and sero-conversion in 62/77 ( 80 . 52% ) cases were noted . Seven ( 9 . 09% ) remained sero-positive even after three years . Progression to clinical disease among asymptomatic individuals was taking place at any time up to three years after the baseline survey . If there are no VL /PKDL cases for two or more years , it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years , if there are such asymptomatic cases . So , asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme that has been initiated by three adjoining endemic countries . \\n Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a vector-borne protozoal disease caused by the Leishmania donovani species complex . Estimated 200000–400000 new cases are recorded per year worldwide [1] of which 67% of the total cases are contributed by three Asian countries India , Nepal , and Bangladesh . In this part of the world L . donovani is the only causative agent of VL , Phlebotomus argentipes is the only known vector and the only reservoir is human [2 , 3] . Availability of reliable , effective and safer drugs like oral miltefosine and liposomal amphotericine for treatment , indoor residual spray for vector control and antigen based rapid diagnostic test kits ( rK39 ) usable at field level makes the disease as a candidate for elimination [4 , 5] . On this background India , Nepal , and Bangladesh launched a joint VL elimination initiative in 2005 with a target of bringing the incidence down to less than 1 case per 10 , 000 population by 2015 [6] . This elimination initiative faced an important challenge due to asymptomatic infection . L . donovani infection results into a full-blown symptomatic disease or asymptomatic carrier without any clinical manifestations for a long period . Asymptomatic leishmaniasis is not well defined; generally it is described by a positive serological test , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , or leishmanin skin test ( LST ) in individuals who are apparently in a healthy condition [7 , 8] . In an endemic area , most of L . donovani infections remain asymptomatic [9] . Cross-sectional surveys based on serological studies showed that a high proportion of serologically positive persons are asymptomatic [10–17] . Mathematical modeling shows that asymptomatic carriers , constituting a reservoir of parasites , may drive the epidemic in future [18] , although their infectiousness to sand flies is yet to be established . Several prospective studies have documented the ratio of asymptomatic infection to incident clinical VL cases as 1:2 . 4 to 5 . 6:1 in African countries [19–21] , 18:1 to 50:1 in South American and European countries [22 , 23] and 3 . 8:1 to 8 . 9:1 in Asian countries [24–26] . The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission , the prognosis of these cases at the individual level and the rate of transformation to symptomatic VL/PKDL needs to be evaluated . The present study was designed to determine the actual burden of the asymptomatic cases and pattern of disease progression ( development of signs and symptoms of VL or PKDL ) , and rate of sero-conversion ( serologically positive to negative ) among them in an endemic area of Malda district , West Bengal . \\n Depending upon the records of State/District health offices about VL/PKDL cases during past few years , eight tribal villages of three sub-centres of Malda district were selected . The district Malda is situated just north to the river Ganges; it has an international border with Bangladesh in the East and an interstate border with Bihar in the West which is endemic for leishmaniasis ( Fig 1 ) . Before initiation of the mass survey population of the villages were sensitized and explained about the objectives of the study and were requested to participate . Volunteers were selected from the population and trained about the study protocol and grouped into three member teams leaded by one person from project staff / an investigator from Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine . The teams made complete census of the study population by house-to-house visit and filled up a questionnaire in a printed book , about history of VL/PKDL and treatment received , age , sex , presence / history of fever , occupation , level of education . After obtaining verbal consent from the head of the family and also from each individual , rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) based on rK39 was done for the detection of anti-leishmanial antibody . All RDT positive persons were examined clinically for the detection of probable cases of VL/PKDL . Suspected such cases were subjected for parasitological investigation and referred to their local primary health centres ( PHCs ) for treatment . Apparently healthy person positive for antileishmanial antibody were classified as asymptomatic cases and were followed up to record the development of any sign of VL or PKDL and to study the pattern of sero-conversion during three study years . The ethical aspect of the study was described earlier [35] . In brief , the objectives of the study were explained to the village population by the study team headed by a medical doctor from Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine . The selected population was invited to participate into the study . They were also informed that their identity would not be disclosed in any way and they could withdraw from the study at any time without any explanation . Written informed consent was obtained from antileishmanial antibody positive cases or from their legal guardians of the child below the age of 14 years , having no history of kala azar detected by mass screening . There were three such cases between the age group of 14 to 17 years and informed written consent was obtained from them in presence of their legal guardians . Such cases were examined clinically for detection of sign and symptoms of active VL and asymptomatic VL cases were followed up for three years . The Ethics Committee of the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine reviewed and approved the study protocol . All the identified asymptomatic VL cases were followed up both clinically and serologically on 3rd , 6th , 12th , 18th , 24th , 30th and 36th month of the study to know the rate of progression to clinical disease and sero-conversion . All diagnosed VL and PKDL cases were treated with either Sodium Stibo Gluconate ( SSG ) or miltefosine as per National Vector Born Disease Control Program ( NVBDCP ) of India . Drugs were supplied by Dy . Director of Health Services , Malaria , State Programme Officer , Government of West Bengal . \\n The study was undertaken during September 2012 to August 2015 in eight tribal villages of Malda district , West Bengal . In all villages under study , the houses are made of mud or brick . The source of drinking water in those villages is tube well and household works are done by pond water . Most of the houses have cattle sheds . Pig rearing is the common practice in all villages . Most of the peoples are agricultural or migratory labour by profession . Total population of the study village was 2890 ( 1439 male and 1451 female ) among them 2603 population was screened for antileishmanial antibody . A total of 185 individuals were positive for antileishmanial antibody , of them 96 had a history of kala-azar/PKDL and 89 without any history of kala-azar ( KA ) . Individuals ( n = 89 ) having no past KA history were examined clinically for fever/ history of fever , pallor , hepato-splenomegaly by clinicians of the team . Ten such individuals were diagnosed as active VL and were treated with sodium stibo gluconate ( SSG ) as mentioned earlier . Remaining 79 cases were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis with a prevalence of 3 . 16% ( 79/2497 ) among the healthy individuals , of them 43 was male and 36 female . The demographic parameters of asymptomatic cases are given in Table 1 . The ratio of asymptomatic infection to incidence active VL cases was 7 . 9:1 at that time in the study population . Healthy individuals having no signs and symptoms of VL or PKDL but positive for antileishmanial antibody were classified as asymptomatic infection . Among the asymptomatic cases who became serologically negative during follow up period were referred as sero-conversion and those developed the signs and symptoms of VL or PKDL as disease progression . All asymptomatic individuals ( n = 79 ) were followed up both clinically and serologically at a regular interval of six months for three years to determine the rate of sero-positive to sero-negative and also to record the progression from asymptomatic infection to symptomatic VL or PKDL . During 36 months of follow up visit , 2 asymptomatic cases were lost to follow up as they moved to other places . Symptoms of VL developed in 7 ( 9 . 09% , 7/77 ) asymptomatically infected individuals , one after 6 months , two after 12 months , one after 18 months , three after 30 months . During 36 months follow up , sign of PKDL was observed in one asymptomatic case which was parasitologicaly confirmed by the demonstration of amastigotes in skin scrapping smear . The patient was examined thoroughly but did not show any symptoms of VL—like fever , history of fever during last one month and splenomegaly . A total of 62 ( 80 . 52% ) cases became sero-negative , 14 after 24 months , 27 after 30 months and 21 after 36 months follow up period . Interestingly 7 ( 9 . 09% ) individuals still remained positive serologically even after three years . So they need more follow up period . The patterns of sero-conversion and progression to clinical disease of the asymptomatic individuals are given in Fig 2 . Out of 17 VL case , 10 were treated with SSG and remaining 7 with miltefosine ( MIL ) . All the patients responded to their respective chemotherapy provided and no sign of PKDL was recorded among them during three years of the study . \\n The development of full blown VL/KA from the initial infection by the bite of an infected sand fly is a complex phenomenon and it takes few months to years . Several factors like host’s immunity [27] and nutritional status [28 , 29] play an important role in it . In an endemic area a large number of individuals are asymptomatic with positive for antileishmanial antibodies . These individuals are apparently healthy and are not attending any health care system for diagnosis . The rate of such infection varies from region to region . In the present study we observed a prevalence rate of 3 . 16% ( 79/2497 ) asymptomatic leishmanial infection among the healthy population screened which is lower than the range of 5 . 62% - 13 . 8% detected by a no . of studies in Bihar using rK-39-ICT [30] . The ratio of asymptomatic infection with symptomatic cases was 7 . 9:1 . Similar ratio of asymptomatic infection was also reported from India and Nepal [25] , whereas a lower ratio was also reported from other parts of India and Bangladesh [24 , 26] . A higher ratio was also reported from Brazil and Spain [22 , 23] which might be due to different parasite species i . e . L . infantum with distinct life cycle to that of L . donovani in India . This ratio of asymptomatic infection to disease may differ from village to village within the same population has been reported by Khalil et al . , 2002 [31] due to different risk factors like contact of VL , presence of other seropositive cases , family size , house type , cattle rearing and poverty [30] . India , Nepal , and Bangladesh took an initiative to eliminate VL by 2015 from this part of the World [6] . Asymptomatic infection is one of the great challenges faced by this initiative . Several questions remained unresolved regarding these asymptomatic infections—whether these persons are infectious to the sand flies ? Who among the asymptomatically infected people will develop VL and when [14] . Which infection remains asymptomatic and how long [27] . Population-based long term prospective epidemiological studies are needed to answer these . In the present study we observed that 14 ( 18 . 18% ) asymptomatic individuals became sero-negative after two years and 48 ( 62 . 34% ) after three years of initial diagnosis . Most importantly 7 ( 9 . 09% ) still remained sero-positive even after three years , which requires more follow up , but how long , it is difficult to say . In a prospective study in India and Nepal Ostyn et al . , 2011 [25] observed a higher rate of sero-eversion ( 86 . 7% ) among asymptomatic infections within one year . Similar observation was also made in Brazil and Kenya [22 , 20] . In the present study , symptomatic VL developed in 7 ( 9 . 09% ) asymptomatic cases during three years of follow up . The proportion asymptomatic VL infection that progress to clinical disease within one year was 3 . 9% which is within the range of 1 . 5% - 23 . 1% as recorded in Bihar studies [30] . A study from Bihar , India by Topno et al . , 2010 [26] showed that clinical VL developed in 7 ( 18 . 42% ) of the 38 asymptomatic individuals in less than 6 months of initial diagnosis . The rate of progression to disease was 17 . 85/1000 PY , similar observation was also made from another parts of India and Nepal [25] and also from Brazil [22 , 32] . Topno et al . , 2010 [26] also reported that no new cases of VL were developed after six months follow up of asymptomatic cases . In contrast , in the present study we recorded longer latent period for L . donovani infection . In addition 7 ( 8 . 9% ) cases remained asymptomatic after three years . Our study showed that progression to clinical disease among rK39-positive asymptomatic cases taking place at any time , up to three or more years after the baseline survey which is similar to that observed by Gidwani et al . , 2009 [14] in Bihar . Most important aspect is the development of PKDL in one of the asymptomatic cases after three years of initial diagnosis . PKDL is considered as a reservoir for transmission of VL [33–35] as the parasites are easily available to the vector sandfly . We have reported a high prevalence of PKDL from the same study area previously [36] . So long term prospective studies are required to observe the fate of all asymptomatic cases . Scientists used different tools for diagnosis of asymptomatic infection like DAT , rK39 and PCR . In the present study we used rK39 based rapid diagnostic kit for this purpose . It is easier to perform at the field level without any invasive method and it does not required any sophisticated laboratory facilities like to that of PCR based diagnosis . In a given period if there are no cases of VL/PKDL for two or more years , it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years , if there are such asymptomatic cases . So , asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme that has been initiated by three adjoining endemic countries . If we allow these individuals to stay in the community , there might be a chance of epidemic in future . Though the available antileishmanial drugs are costly and toxic , but a case control study by treating all asymptomatic cases with single dose liposomal amphotericin in a given geographical area may enlighten the role of such intervention for elimination to eradication of leishmaniasis .   \n",
       "1374  Aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangements ( GCRs ) can lead to genetic diseases and the development of cancer . We previously demonstrated that introduction of the repetitive retrotransposon Ty912 onto a nonessential chromosome arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to increased genome instability predominantly due to increased rates of formation of monocentric nonreciprocal translocations . In this study , we adapted Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ) to analyze a large numbers of these GCRs . Using MLPA , we found that the distribution of translocations induced by the presence of Ty912 in a wild-type strain was nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes , even though there were 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S . cerevisiae genome . While the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination , we observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements . The formation of these RAD52-independent translocations did not require the Rad51 or Rad59 homologous pairing proteins or the Rad1–Rad10 endonuclease complex that processes branched DNAs during recombination . Finally , we found that defects in ASF1-RTT109–dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 ( H3K56 ) resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications , and resulted in aneuploidy that tended to occur simultaneously with GCRs . Overall , we found that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy . \\n Genome stability is important for normal cellular survival and growth . In contrast , genome instability is associated with abnormal cellular growth . For example , tumor cells often contain multiple genome rearrangements and/or exhibit aneuploidy , and such events are thought to contribute to the development and progression of cancer [1]–[4] . Genome rearrangements are also associated with inborn genetic diseases . For instance , copy number changes mediated by segmental duplications are associated with a diversity of genetic diseases [5] and whole chromosome aneuploidy can cause diseases like Down Syndrome [6] . While the association of genome rearrangements and aneuploidy with human genetic disease is well established , the genetic factors that suppress or enhance genome rearrangements and aneuploidy are less well understood . We previously developed quantitative genetic assays for measuring the rates at which GCRs occur in Saccharomyces cerevisiae . These assays , and modified versions of them , select for progeny that lose a nonessential chromosome arm due to a GCR mediated by either non-repetitive [7]–[10] , low-copy repeat [9] , [11] , or high-copy repeat DNA [12] and allow quantitative genetic analysis of the pathways that suppress or promote the formation of GCRs [13] . Genetic studies using these assays have revealed that numerous genes and pathways contribute to genome stability by suppressing the formation of gross chromosomal rearrangements ( GCRs ) and/or the loss or gain of whole chromosomes [7] , [11] , [14]–[22] . To fully understand the mechanisms by which GCRs are formed , it is often necessary to determine their structures and sequence their rearrangement breakpoints . However , such analysis of rearranged genomes remains a challenge , particularly due to the large number that must be analyzed to determine the mechanisms by which the GCRs were formed . A number of different techniques have been used to analyze the structure of GCRs including: 1 ) Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis ( PFGE ) to determine the size of rearranged chromosomes [12] , [15] , [23]–[27]; 2 ) different methods for PCR amplification and sequencing of rearrangement breakpoints [7] , [11] , [12] , [20]–[23] , [26]–[28]; 3 ) cloning and/or restriction mapping of rearrangement breakpoints [12] , [14] , [15]; 4 ) array Comparative Genomic Hybridization ( aCGH ) that allows for the identification of regions of copy number change but does not provide information about connectivity of the rearranged regions [12] , [14] , [15] , [23] , [26] , [27]; and 5 ) next-generation DNA sequencing , which has the potential to provide considerable detail about the structure of genome rearrangements [29] . However , all of these methods fail to scale when analyzing a large number of rearranged genomes , due to either high costs or the tedious natures of the methods . In this study , we adapted a PCR-based method , Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ) , to supplement the analysis of Ty1-mediated GCRs in a manner that scales well in terms of both cost and time . MLPA is a multiplex ligation-dependent amplification technique that has been used to identify duplications , deletions , and aneuploidy in human cells [30]–[32] . Briefly , multiple pairs of oligonucleotide probes are designed such that each probe in a pair hybridizes next to the other member of the pair at regions of interest in the genome . The total length of each pair of probes is distinct and is used to identify specific regions in the genome on the basis of the length of the final MLPA product . The probes are hybridized to genomic DNA , and then adjacent probes are ligated and amplified using a common pair of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide primers . Products are separated and their length and fluorescent intensities measured using capillary electrophoresis . Analysis of the fluorescent intensities allows the determination of copy number differences between control and experimental samples . The main advantage of MLPA is its ability to provide copy number variation data for targeted regions in a rapid , inexpensive , and highly parallel manner . While MLPA does not provide the dense genome-wide coverage of aCGH or next-generation sequencing , it can cover multiple regions of interest simultaneously at a density sufficient for many types of genetic studies . In the present study we demonstrate the utility of MLPA for analyzing GCRs by investigating the target site bias of Ty1-mediated GCRs , RAD52-independent formation of Ty1-mediated translocations , and aneuploidy induced by deletion of RTT109 , a gene encoding a histone acetyltransferase . \\n In previous work we demonstrated that insertion of Ty912 between CIN8 and NPR2 in a nonessential terminal region of chromosome V ( the +Ty912 GCR assay ) ( Figure 1a ) , led to an increase in the rate of accumulating GCRs [12] . When we screened 88 independent GCR-containing strains derived from either wild-type or one of 11 different mutant strains , we found that all ( 88 of 88 ) of these GCR-containing strains contained a deletion of chromosome V from Ty912 to TEL05L ( the left telomere of chromosome V ) and almost all ( 82 of 88 ) of these GCR-containing strains also contained a duplicated region from another chromosome arm bounded by an ectopic Ty1 , Ty2 , or solo delta sequence at one end and a telomere at the other end . Structural studies demonstrated that these duplication-containing strains each contained a translocation consisting of the centromere-containing fragment of chromosome V joined to the duplicated region of the target chromosome , with a junction involving Ty912 and the bounding ectopic Ty element of the duplicated region . 94% of the translocations were simple translocations with a single junction involving Ty912 and a single target ectopic Ty element and 6% appeared to involve a dicentric translocation intermediate that underwent secondary rearrangements . In addition , each GCR-containing strain also contained a wild-type copy of the chromosome from which the duplicated sequence was derived . Overall , this analysis indicated that all of the Ty912-mediated translocations observed were formed by a non-reciprocal recombination-mediated translocation mechanism . To better characterize the distribution of the observed chromosome arm duplications , we developed a MLPA probe set capable of identifying duplicated and deleted chromosome arms . A “telomeric” probe set was designed to identify copy number changes at genomic loci located at the ends of each chromosome arm in S . cerevisiae . The probes were designed to hybridize between the telomeres of each chromosome and their closest respective Ty1 , Ty2 , or solo delta element ( Figure 1b , 1c ) ; however , four probes ( chrII-L , chrIV-R , chrIX-R , and chrXV-L ) could not be designed to meet this criterion due to the lack of suitable non-repetitive DNA regions near the telomeres of these chromosome arms , and were instead designed to hybridize immediately centromeric to the terminal Ty elements present at the 4 chromosome ends ( Table S1 ) . As a result , the telomeric probe set theoretically detects 98 . 4% ( 250/254 ) of the possible translocation-associated duplications resulting from Ty912-mediated nonreciprocal translocations targeting ectopic Ty-related elements in the S288C reference genome . Using this telomeric MLPA probe set , we first reanalyzed 5 isolates that were derived from the wild-type +Ty912 GCR assay strain and that were each previously identified by aCGH to contain a translocation chromosome associated with a chromosome arm duplication [12] . The MLPA results concurred with the previous aCGH results and , in each case , identified both the chromosome V-L deletion and the associated chromosome arm duplication identified previously ( Figure 1d ) . We next screened 112 newly isolated independent GCR-containing strains derived from the wild-type +Ty912 GCR assay strain . The MLPA data revealed that all ( 112 of 112 ) GCR-containing strains lost the left arm of chromosome V , and almost all ( 106 of 112 ) contained a duplicated region of another chromosome arm ( Table S2 ) . The remaining isolates either had no detectable duplication ( 5 of 112 ) or could not be unambiguously assigned to a rearrangement class ( 1 of 112 ) . We calculated a pair of expected distributions for the chromosome arm duplications based on the assumption that Ty912 could recombine with either all annotated ectopic Ty1 elements at equal frequency or all annotated ectopic Ty1 and delta elements ( in this analysis , each of the 13 Ty2 elements were included as 2 separate delta elements; see Methods ) at equal frequency ( Figure 2a , 2b ) . Analysis of the 106 observed duplicated chromosome arms isolated in the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain ( Figure 2c; Table S2 ) revealed numerous chromosome arm duplications that did not contain any annotated full length Ty1 sequences in the S288c reference sequence ( chrIII-L , chrIII-R , chrIX-L , chrXIII-L , chrXIV-R , chrXV-L , and chrXVI-L ) , indicating that , consistent with our previous results [12] , both ectopic Ty1 and delta elements are likely to have mediated the observed chromosome arm duplications . We found the distribution of observed chromosome arm duplications to be significantly different from a theoretical distribution that assumed that all Ty1 and delta elements acted as translocation targets ( Monte Carlo Sampling of a Multinomial Distribution; 2000 replicates; Empirical p = 5 . 00×10−4 ) . Several chromosome arm duplications were significantly overrepresented in the observed distribution compared to the theoretical distribution , including duplications of chrIII-R ( 28 times; exact binomial; p = 5×10−18 ) , chrV-R ( 27 times; exact binomial; p = 1×10−9 ) , chrXIV-L ( 8 times; exact binomial; p = 4×10−5 ) , and chrX-R ( 10 times; exact binomial; p = 2×10−3 ) . Together these 4 classes of chromosome arm duplications represented 69% ( 73 of 106 ) of the observed duplications . We next sought to identify if there was any bias in this analysis due to the orientation of Ty912 on chromosome V . We and others have previously shown that translocations targeting centromere-oriented Ty elements yield dicentric chromosomes that must undergo secondary rearrangements to eliminate a centromere [12] , [16] , [23] . Due to this requirement of secondary rearrangements , these events are likely to be under-represented relative to the proportion of recombinations involving telomere-oriented Ty elements . Thus , it is possible that inclusion of centromere-oriented Ty elements in the list of possible recombination targets biased our analysis . . To check for such bias , we compared the observed distribution of chromosome arm duplications to the distribution of potential telomere-oriented Ty1 and delta element translocation targets ( Figure S1 ) . The chrIII-R , chrV-R , chrXIV-L , and chrX-R duplications were still significantly over-represented when compared to this theoretical distribution ( exact binomials; p = 2×10−13 , 1×10−8 , 4×10−4 , and 1×10−2 , respectively ) . Thus , our MLPA analysis of a large number of GCRs isolated from a single genetic background confirmed the chromosome arm duplication bias we previously noted when we used aCGH to analyze a smaller number of GCR-containing strains isolated from 12 different wild-type and mutant strains [12] . In order to investigate the possibility that specific Ty-related elements were responsible for the observed chromosome arm duplication bias in the wild-type +Ty912 GCR assay , we created a series of MLPA probe sets specific for chrIII-R , chrV-R , chrX-R , and chrXIV-L . These probe sets contained one or two pairs of primers designed to hybridize between every pair of Ty1 , Ty2 , solo delta , centromeric , and telomeric element along each chromosome arm , except for a few cases of closely collocated Ty loci ( Figure 3a–3d; Tables S3 , S5 , S6 , S7 ) . We first used the chrIII-R MLPA probe set ( Figure 3a; Table S3 ) to analyze the 28 GCRs involving chromosome III right arm duplications . Two patterns of chromosome arm duplications were observed: those in which the chrIII-R probes telomeric , but not centromeric , to the YCRWdelta8-YCRWdelta9-YCRWdelta10 locus ( 61%; n = 17 ) were duplicated and those in which the chrIII-R probes telomeric , but not centromeric , to the YCRWdelta11 locus ( 39%; n = 11 ) were duplicated ( Figure 3a; Table 1 ) . These loci have been previously termed fragile site 1 ( FS1 ) and fragile site 2 ( FS2 ) and were originally identified as hotspots of Ty recombination under conditions of DNA replication stress caused by reduction of the levels of different replicative DNA polymerases [15] . FS1 was found to replace the SRD1 and YCRWdelta8-YCRWdelta9-YCRWdelta10 loci in the S288c annotated sequence with a pair of tandem full length Ty1s oriented in a direct repeat orientation . FS2 was found to contain two Ty1s oriented in an inverted head-head configuration with a 283 bp spacer sequence in between the two Ty1s instead of the single annotated YCRWdelta11 locus . Other studies have also confirmed that these loci show differences from the SGD S288c reference sequence [27] , [33] . We confirmed the presence of both the tandem direct repeat pair of full length Ty1s at FS1 and the pair of inverted repeat Ty1s at FS2 in our strains by PCR and sequencing . These results demonstrate that MLPA can be used to identify specific translocation fusion junctions and that FS1 and FS2 , even in the presence of normal rates of DNA replication , likely have fragile site activity that results in increased frequencies of Ty-mediated translocations . We next analyzed the GCR-containing strains associated with other overrepresented chromosome arm duplications ( chrV-R , XIV-L , and X-R ) using the remaining chromosome arm-specific MLPA probe sets ( Tables S5 , S6 , S7 ) . The MLPA data revealed the existence of Ty-mediated translocation hotspots on each of the chromosome arms ( Figure 3b–3d; Table 1 ) . The majority of duplications ( 18 of 27 ) of the right arm of chromosome V appeared to target the linked YERWdelta17 , YERWdelta21 , and YERCTy1-1 loci ( note that this region also contains an unannotated partial Ty sequence [12] ) , with a smaller proportion ( 5 of 27 ) of duplications targeting the region containing the linked YERCdelta14 , YERCdelta15 , and YERCdelta16 loci . This is in agreement with several studies that observed the involvement of the linked YERWdelta17 , YERWdelta21 , and YERCTy1-1 loci in Ty-mediated repair of DNA double strand breaks ( DSBs ) [9] , [26] , including our own prior observation of a translocation in which Ty912 of our assay targeted the centromere-oriented YERCTy1-1 on chrV-R and resulted in a dicentric translocation chromosome . This dicentric chromosome then underwent additional rounds of rearrangements to yield a monocentric translocation that had duplicated the telomeric end of chrV-R [12] . Likewise , 75% ( 6 of 8 ) of the chromosome arm duplications involving the left arm of chromosome XIV appeared to target YNLCTy2-1 . All of the duplications on the right arm of chromosome X ( 10 of 10 ) appeared to involve the YJRWTy1-1/YJRWTy1-2 tandem Ty1 locus . Overall , these results indicate that 63 . 2% ( 67 of 106 ) of the total Ty-mediated chromosome arm duplications identified in the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain could be accounted for by only 6 Ty target regions on 4 chromosome arms , which contrasts with the presence of 254 potential targets in the S . cerevisiae genome . One possible explanation for the observed Ty target bias is that Ty912 preferentially recombines with regions of high sequence homology . Although this explanation was at odds with the results for chromosome III ( Ty912 has 93% average sequence identity with Ty-related elements on chromosome III-L involved in 2 chromosome arm duplications and 77% average sequence identity with Ty-related elements on chromosome III-R involved in 28 chromosome arm duplications ) , overall sequence identity may not be the appropriate measure of homology that mediates recombination with Ty912 , as a previous study examining DSB-induced HR between Ty elements has noted [27] . We therefore investigated the possibility that translocations mediated by recombination between divergent homologous regions are suppressed by mismatch repair [11] , [34] , [35] . Thus , if sequence homologies drive the target distribution bias seen for Ty-mediated translocations , an msh2Δ mutation that eliminates suppression of homeologous recombination should alter the distribution of target Ty elements and chromosome arm duplications . An msh2Δ mutation resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in the rate of Ty912-mediated GCRs ( Table 2 ) . All 44 GCRs isolated in the msh2Δ mutant were associated with a chromosome V-L deletion and 43 of these GCRs were also associated with a chromosome arm duplication . In order to look for significant changes between the msh2Δ strain relative to the wild-type strain , we calculated the fold change between the observed duplication rate of each chromosome arm in the msh2Δ mutant relative to an expected duplication rate for each chromosome arm ( see Methods ) . The expected duplication rate assumed that the msh2Δ mutation evenly increased the duplication rates of all chromosome arms by the bulk-fold change between the msh2Δ mutant and wild-type GCR rates and hence the msh2Δ mutation was expected to increase the rate of each duplication 3-fold ( Table 2 ) ; in other words , we assumed the msh2Δ mutation did not preferentially affect the rate of any specific translocation ( see Methods ) . The duplication rates for each chromosome arm in the msh2Δ mutant were generally within the 95% confidence interval of the predicted msh2Δ rates and were approximately three-fold higher than the wild-type rates , consistent with the idea that the msh2Δ mutation increased both the average GCR rate and the translocation rate of each chromosome arm by 3-fold . The only exceptions were the duplication rates of chromosome arms II-R , XVI-R , and V-R . Chromosome arm II-R and XVI-R duplications were not previously seen among the 112 wild-type GCRs analyzed and occurred at about a five-fold higher rate in the msh2Δ mutant than predicted from the maximum wild-type rate calculated for these 2 sites . The duplication rate of chromosome V-R was approximately four-fold lower than predicted from the wild-type rate ( Figure 2c ) . The duplication rates of all three of these chromosome arms were outside the 95% confidence interval of their predicted duplication rates calculated from the measured msh2Δ bulk rate ( p<0 . 05 ) . In addition , the number of chromosome V duplications observed in the msh2Δ mutant was significantly lower than that seen in the wild-type strain ( Fisher's Exact Test; p = 0 . 0122 ) . However , GCRs associated with duplicated chromosome arms containing the translocation hotspots ( chrIII-R , V-R , X-R , and XIV-L ) were seen in both the msh2Δ +Ty912 assay strain and the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain in roughly equal proportions ( 70% vs . 69% ) . These results indicate that while an MSH2-dependent function may both modestly affect the rate of specific translocations and be potentially important for the formation of translocations involving the chromosome V-R hotspot , mismatch repair is largely not responsible for the biased distribution of translocations in the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain . This supports the idea that the sequence homology relationships between Ty912 and the other Ty elements in the S . cerevisiae genome are unlikely to be the sole , or major , determinant of translocation target site selection . One possible reason for the fact that six hotspots comprise nearly 70% of the observed chromosome duplications is that the six hotspots lie in close physical proximity to Ty912 , as such physical proximity may determine the ease with which homologous sequences can be targeted by HR . Using previous data that mapped the 3-dimensional spatial relationship of all chromosomes in wild-type cells [36] , we analyzed whether any of the six observed hotspots as well as the 20+ kb regions containing each hotspot were in close proximity to the region of chromosome V where Ty912 was inserted . Analysis of the Chromosome Conformation Capture-on-Chip ( 4C ) data generated with HindIII indicated that 2 of the 6 hotspots showed limited association with Ty912 on the left arm of chromosome V , whereas analysis of the data generated with EcoRI indicated that none of the hotspots were located adjacent to chrV-L ( Table S4 ) . Thus , we found minimal to no interactions between the region surrounding Ty912 and the observed hotspot locations . Consequently , it is unlikely that physical proximity plays a large role in the selection of the most commonly used translocation targets . Most of the GCRs identified using the +Ty912 assay appear to result from RAD52-dependent Ty-mediated HR resulting in non-reciprocal translocations [12] . In S . cerevisiae , RAD52-dependent HR is primarily mediated by two pathways , which are dependent upon RAD51 and RAD59 , respectively [37] . Surprisingly , a rad51Δ single mutant had a significantly increased rate of Ty-mediated GCRs compared to wild type ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 4 . 89×10−7 ) , whereas a rad59Δ mutation decreased the GCR rate of the rad51Δ mutant strain to one equivalent to the GCR rate of the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 89 ) ( Table 2; Table S2 ) . The rad59 smutation had no significant effect on the Ty-mediated GCR rate of a wild-type strain ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 34 ) . Interestingly , our previous results indicate that the GCR rate of the rad51Δ rad59Δ +Ty912 assay strain was 53-fold higher that that seen for the rad51Δ rad59Δ −Ty912 assay strain , suggesting that Ty912-mediated GCRs occur at low rates in the rad51Δ rad59Δ mutant ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 2 . 09×10−6 ) [12] . To investigate how a rad51Δ mutation affected the formation of GCRs , we analyzed 46 GCR-containing isolates derived from a rad51Δ +Ty912 assay strain ( Table S2 ) . All 46 isolates contained a chromosome V-L deletion , and 42 of these isolates each contained a chromosome arm duplication ( Figure 4a ) . Four isolates did not have any accompanying chromosome arm duplications , which was a small , but statistically significant , increase compared to the bulk fold increase in the total GCR rate ( p<0 . 05 ) . This suggests that a rad51Δ mutation results in a small increase in the rate of formation of broken chromosomes that are subsequently healed by de novo telomere addition [19] . There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of GCRs associated with chromosome III-R duplications arising from the rad51Δ mutant compared to a wild-type strain ( Fisher's exact test; p = 4 . 16×10−4 ) and , using the same method that was used to analyze the effect of an msh2Δ mutation on the rate of individual chromosome arm duplications , we found that the rate of chromosome III-R duplications was significantly decreased as well ( p<0 . 05; Figure 4b ) . In contrast , the rates of the chromosome arm duplications involving the chromosome V-R , X-R , and XIV-L hotspots were not preferentially affected by the rad51Δ mutation . Additionally , chromosome IX-L and XII-R duplications were statistically significantly increased in the rad51Δ mutant compared to the relative bulk effect of a rad51Δ mutation . There were also statistically significant increases in the rates of duplication of several chromosome arms not originally observed among the 112 wild-type derived Ty912-mediated GCRs ( chromosomes II-R , VII-L , XI-L , XII-L , XIII-R , and XV-R ) ( Figure 4b; p<0 . 05 ) . Overall , these results suggest that RAD51 is important for the formation of GCRs involving the hotspots on chromosome III-R and is important for the suppression of GCRs involving many other Ty-related translocation targets . To better understand the function of RAD59 in promoting GCRs in a rad51Δ mutant , we analyzed 30 Ty912-mediated GCRs obtained from a rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant ( Table S2 ) . We did not analyze a large number of GCRs isolated from a rad59Δ single mutant as a rad59Δ mutation did not significantly change the GCR rate in the +Ty912 assay ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 343 ) ( Table 2 ) . All 30 GCRs derived from the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant contained the chromosome V-L deletion and 29 of these GCRs were also associated with single chromosome arm duplications . Compared to the bulk fold increase in the GCR rate relative to the wild-type GCR rate , the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant had statistically significant decreases in the duplication rates of chromosomes III-R , IV-R , and XII-R , and an increase in the duplication rate of chromosome IX-L ( p<0 . 05 ) . We also noted chromosome X-L ( n = 1 ) , chromosome XI-L ( n = 2 ) and chromosome XI-R ( n = 5 ) duplications , which were not seen in the wild-type chromosome arm distribution . The rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant had a lower overall GCR rate than the rad51Δ single mutant ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 1 . 13×10−5 ) ( Table 2 ) . Compared to the bulk affect of a rad59Δ mutation in a rad51Δ single mutant ( see Methods ) , the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant had decreased rates of duplication of chromosome arms IV-R and XII-R , as well as increased rates of duplication of chromosome arms XI-L and XI-R ( Figure 4c; p<0 . 05 ) . In addition , the duplication rates of the chromosome arms associated with the chromosome III-R , V-R , X-R and XIV-L hotspots were reduced in the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant relative to the rad51Δ single mutant to the same extent as the bulk GCR rate ( Figure 4c , p>0 . 05 ) . Overall , these results support the view that a RAD51-dependent HR pathway is important for suppressing Ty912-mediated translocations and that most of the translocations seen in the rad51Δ single mutant are promoted by RAD59-dependent HR . To verify that the duplicated chromosome arms associated with the GCRs formed in the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant were indeed fused to chromosome V , we analyzed 7 rad51Δ rad59Δ-derived GCRs using PFGE followed by Southern blotting with a probe specific to MCM3 , an essential gene on chromosome V . The results showed that all 7 GCRs ( I1–I7 ) were associated with abnormally large chromosome Vs , consistent with the duplicated chromosome arms being fused to deleted chromosome Vs ( Figure 4d ) , and reminiscent of previously investigated nonreciprocal translocations [12] . We did not verify the nature of the fusion junctions in these translocation chromosomes , although , as discussed below , we did verify the nature of several such translocation junctions identified in rad52Δ single and rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ triple mutants . There was a 5-fold decrease in the GCR rate of the rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain compared to that of the wild-type +Ty912 assay strain ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 1 . 69×10−05 ) , consistent with the bulk of the Ty912-mediated GCRs being formed by HR ( Table 2 ) . The GCR rate of the rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain , however , was previously determined to be slightly , but not strictly significantly , higher than the GCR rate of the rad52Δ −Ty assay strain ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 0625 ) [12] , suggesting that Ty912-mediated GCRs may still occur at low rates in the rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain . To further investigate the role of RAD52 in the formation of Ty1-mediated GCRs , we used MLPA to analyze 50 independent GCRs derived from a rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain ( Table S2 ) . All 50 GCRs were associated with the chromosome V-L deletion . We did not detect any additional genome alterations in 34 ( 68% ) of these isolates , a finding consistent with a high rate of GCRs mediated by de novo telomere additions in a rad52Δ mutant [11] , [19] , [38] . In 16 ( 32% ) of the isolates , we observed additional chromosome arm duplications , with each isolate containing one chromosome arm duplication ( Figure 5a ) . This represented a significant decrease in the proportion of GCRs associated with chromosome arm duplications when compared those obtained from a wild-type strain ( Fisher's Exact test; p = <2 . 2×10−16 ) . Interestingly , the rad52Δ mutant shared none of the significant chromosome arm duplication changes seen in the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant when these two mutant strains were compared with a rad51Δ single mutant , although this may be due to the small number of chromosome arm duplications analyzed in the case of the rad52Δ mutant ( Figure 4c ) . To confirm that the observed chromosome arm duplications seen in the rad52Δ mutant were associated with the formation of nonreciprocal translocations involving chromosome V-L and the duplicated chromosome arms , we further analyzed 7 rad52Δ-derived GCR-containing isolates , two of which ( I15 and I18 ) did not have chromosome arm duplications as determined by MLPA and five of which had single arm duplications ( I16 [chrIII-R] , I17 [chrIV-R] , I19 [chrX-R] , I20 [chrX-R] , and I21 [chrV-R] ) . Analysis of these isolates by PFGE followed by Southern blotting utilizing a probe to the chromosome V gene MCM3 revealed that each of the isolates without chromosome arm duplications contained a smaller than wild-type chromosome V ( consistent with the known chromosome V-L deletion associated with a de novo telomere addition ) and that the isolates with chromosome arm duplications each had a larger than wild-type chromosome V ( Figure 5b ) . No other chromosomes appeared to have altered lengths . Analysis of these same 7 GCR-containing strains by aCGH revealed that all 7 had a deletion of the left arm of chromosome V between TEL05L and Ty912 ( Figure S2 ) . Additionally , each of the 5 strains identified by MLPA to contain a chromosome arm duplication had an additional duplicated region of DNA bounded by a full length Ty1 or solo delta element at one end and a telomere at the other end ( Figure S2; Table S8 ) ; the amplified chromosome arms identified by MLPA were the same as those identified by aCGH . PCR amplification of the breakpoints of 3 of the GCRs ( I17 , I19 and I20 ) associated with chromosome arm duplications confirmed that these GCRs were the result of a fusion between chromosome V-L at Ty912 and the Ty or delta element bounding the duplicated region associated with each GCR ( Figure 5c; Table S8 ) ; the other 2 breakpoints could not be amplified . In addition , PCR amplification and sequencing of the breakpoints of four independent translocations ( I22–25 ) occurring in the rad52Δ +Ty912 assay strain and identified by MLPA to be associated with a chromosome arm duplication similarly demonstrated the presence of translocation chromosomes that resulted from fusions between chromosome V-L at Ty912 and the Ty or delta elements bounding the duplicated region associated with each GCR ( Figure 5c; Table S8 ) . Thus , deletion of RAD52 decreases , but does not completely eliminate , HR that promotes Ty-mediated nonreciprocal translocations [19] , [38] . We next examined whether RAD51 and RAD59 , which encode homologous pairing proteins [37] , and the Rad1–Rad10 complex , which processes non-homologous single-stranded DNA tails that form during single-stranded annealing [39] , were required for the formation of Ty912-mediated translocations formed by RAD52–independent HR . To this end , we investigated to differing degrees the rate and structure of Ty912-mediated GCRs in rad52Δ and rad52Δ rad59Δ double mutants , the rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ triple mutant , and the rad52Δ double mutant . All four mutant strains had GCR rates that were statistically similar to the GCR rate of a rad52Δ single mutant ( Table 2 ) ( Wilcoxon rank sum test; p = 0 . 21 , 0 . 10 , 0 . 95 and 0 . 79 , respectively ) and had statistically similar frequencies of GCRs containing and lacking chromosome arm duplications ( Fisher's Exact Test with Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing; all p values>0 . 0167 ) ( Figure 6a; Figure S3; Table S2 ) [40] . The chromosome arm duplication patterns of the rad52Δ double and triple mutants were also highly similar to that of the rad52Δ single mutant ( Figure 6a; Figure S3 ) , unlike that of the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant ( see above ) . To confirm that the chromosome arm duplications seen in the rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ mutant were associated with the formation of nonreciprocal translocations involving chromosome V-L and the duplicated chromosome arms , we analyzed 7 GCRs isolated from this mutant by PFGE followed by a Southern blotting utilizing a probe to MCM3 . Four GCRs were shown by MLPA to be associated with single chromosome arm duplications ( I10 [chrIV-R] , I11 [chrX-R] , I12 [chr-XIIR] , I13 [chrXII-R] ) and three were not associated with a chromosome arm duplication ( I8 , I9 , I14 ) ( Figure 4d ) . The results revealed that the four GCRs associated with chromosome arm duplications ( I10 , I11 , I12 , I13 ) were each associated with an abnormally large chromosome V and the three GCRs that did not involve a chromosome arm duplication ( I8 , I9 , I14 ) were each associated with a smaller than wild-type chromosome V . The smaller than wild-type chromosome Vs were consistent with the formation of GCRs mediated by de novo telomere addition . No other chromosomes appeared to be altered in these 7 GCR-containing strains . PCR amplification of the breakpoints of 2 of the GCRs derived in the rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ +Ty912 assay strain ( I11 & I12 ) confirmed the presence of translocation chromosomes that were the result of a fusion between chromosome V-L at Ty912 and the Ty1 element bounding the duplicated region associated with each GCR ( Figure 6b ) . Thus , deletion of RAD51 and RAD59 in a rad52Δ mutant does not completely eliminate HR that promotes Ty-mediated nonreciprocal translocations . We next investigated the potential role of two different pathways involving Rtt109 in suppressing GCRs and aneuploidy . Both Vps75 , a histone chaperone , and Asf1 , a nucleosome assembly factor , form separate complexes with Rtt109 that acetylate H3K56 in vitro , although only the Asf1-Rtt109 complex appears to be required for acetylation of H3K56 in vivo [47] . We found that a vps75Δ single mutant had essentially the same rate of Ty912-mediated GCRs as the wild-type strain , whereas an asf1Δ single mutant had an increased rate of Ty912-mediated GCRs similar to that seen for a rtt109Δ mutant ( Table 2 ) . Analysis of 45 vps75Δ and 55 asf1Δ derived GCR-containing isolates for whole chromosome duplications revealed no whole chromosome duplications among the vps75Δ-derived GCR-containing isolates and 7 instances of asf1Δ-derived GCR-containing isolates containing whole chromosome duplications ( Figure 7a; Table S2 ) . The frequency of whole chromosome duplications in the asf1Δ mutant was not significantly different from that of an rtt109Δ mutant ( Fisher's Exact test; p = 0 . 207 ) . Additionally , the distribution of chromosome arm duplications seen for the GCRs derived from the vps75Δ mutant ( 40/45 GCRs ) was strikingly similar to that seen with the wild-type strain , while the distribution of chromosome arm duplications seen for the GCRs derived from the asf1Δ mutant ( 50/55 GCRs ) more closely reflected that of the rtt109Δ mutant ( Figure 7b , 7c; Table S2 ) . RLF2 ( also known as CAC1 ) encodes a subunit of CAF-1 , a chromatin assembly complex that mediates nucleosome assembly in cooperation with ASF1 [48] . Consistent with this , an asf1Δ double mutant was previously demonstrated to have a synergistic increase in the rate of single copy sequence-mediated GCRs compared to both rlf2Δ and asf1Δ single mutants [49] . The rlf2Δ single mutant strain was similar to the wild-type strain and had only a small 2-fold increase in the Ty912-mediated GCR rate ( Table 2 ) . When we analyzed 46 rlf2Δ derived GCR-containing isolates by MLPA , we detected no whole chromosome duplications and a chromosome arm duplication pattern similar to that seen in the wild-type strain , except for increased rates of chromosome III-L , IX-L , XI-L , and XVI-R arm duplications ( Figure S4; Table S2 ) . Similarly , there was no significant increase in the frequency of whole chromosome duplications in an asf1Δ rlf2Δ double mutant compared to an asf1Δ single mutant ( Fisher's Exact test; p = 0 . 483 ) ( Figure 7a ) , even though the double mutant had a synergistic 120-fold increase in the GCR rate compared to the asf1Δ and rlf2Δ single mutants ( Table 2 ) . Moreover , 75% ( 9/12 ) of the chromosome arm duplications seen in the asf1Δ rlf2Δ mutant ( 29/30 GCRs ) were seen in an asf1Δ mutant , while the remaining 25% ( 3/12 ) chromosome arm duplications were observed in the profile of an rlf2Δ mutant . Thus , despite the synergistic increase in GCR rate observed in an asf1Δ rlf2Δ mutant , the distribution of chromosome arm duplications appeared to be additive , with the increase in aneuploidy likely a result of only the asf1Δ mutation . Taken together , these results suggest that the rtt109Δ-dependent increase in whole chromosome duplications is linked to defects in the ASF1-RTT109-dependent H3K56 acetylation pathway . To investigate whether aneuploidy results from the inability of the ASF1-RTT109 complex to acetylate histone H3K56 , we tested mutations that altered histone H3K56 for their effect on the accumulation of whole chromosome duplications . For this analysis , we constructed strains with chromosomal hht1-hhf1Δ hht2-hhf2Δ double deletions carrying plasmids encoding various unacetylatable mutant alleles of HHT2 and a wild-type copy of HHF2 . In this manner , we were able to construct hht1-hhf1Δ hht2-hhf2Δ HHF2 hht2::H3K56G and hht1-hhf1Δ hht2-hhf2Δ HHF2 hht2::H3K56R mutant strains . The strain containing the hht2::H3K56G mutation and the strain containing the hht2::H3K56R mutation both exhibited increased GCR rates that were slightly lower than that of an rtt109Δ mutant ( Table 2 ) . All ( 46/46 ) and 97 . 8% ( 44/45 ) of the GCR-containing isolates derived from the hht2::H3K56G mutant and hht2::H3K56R mutant , respectively , were associated with single chromosome arm duplications; there were 6 and 2 isolates of the hht2::H3K56G and hht2::H3K56R mutant strains , respectively , that had both a whole chromosome duplication as well as a GCR ( Figure 7a ) . The frequency of whole chromosome duplications in the hht2 mutants was either not significantly different ( hht2::H3K56G , Fisher's Exact test; p = 0 . 289 ) or slightly reduced ( hht2::H3K56R , Fisher's Exact test; p = 0 . 0155 ) compared to the rtt109Δ mutant . We further investigated the distribution of chromosome arm duplications for the GCRs derived from the hht2 mutant strains to the distribution seen for the wild-type strain . We focused on seven chromosome arm duplications ( chrIII-R , IV-R , V-R , VII-R , VIII-L , XII-R , and XVI-R ) that shared duplication differences in the rtt109Δ and asf1Δ single mutants when compared to the distribution observed for the wild-type strain ( Figure 7b; Table S2 ) . The profile seen for the hht2::H3K56G mutant shared 4 of the 7 changes ( Hypergeometric test; p = 0 . 0187 ) , while the profile seen for the hht2::H3K56R mutant shared 5 of the 7 changes ( Hypergeometric test; p = 7 . 72×10−6 ) , supporting the view that these two hht2 mutations are similar to the rtt109Δ and asf1Δ in regard to their effects on the suppression of GCRs . Overall , these results suggest that the loss of acetylation at histone H3K56 results in high rates of GCRs and whole chromosome duplications . \\n In this study , we adapted MLPA to identify chromosome arm duplications and deletions , as well as whole chromosome duplications , in order to provide insights into the processes that suppress and promote GCRs in S . cerevisiae . Compared to previous methods used to analyze GCRs [7] , [11] , [12] , [14] , [15] , [20]–[29] , this method is rapid , affordable , and of sufficiently high resolution to provide useful structural insights to guide subsequent analysis . We validated the utility of this method by investigating bias in target site selection of Ty1-mediated translocations , RAD52-independent Ty1-mediated translocations that appear to occur by HR , and whole chromosome duplications that occur at increased rates in an rtt109Δ mutant . This ability to generate structural information for a large numbers of GCRs allowed us to demonstrate the existence of a number of translocation target hotspots and demonstrate that these hotspots likely mediate translocations by different mechanisms . In addition , we obtained evidence for a RAD52-independent HR pathway that can promote Ty1-mediated translocations , as well as evidence for an association between whole chromosome duplications and GCRs in an rtt109Δ mutant . These results demonstrate that the methods developed here will facilitate future analysis of GCR structures in other mutant backgrounds , which will likely reveal yet other unanticipated aspects of the mechanisms that prevent GCRs . We previously observed that GCRs isolated in the presence of Ty912 located on a nonessential arm of chromosome V were almost exclusively associated with a loss of the region of chromosome V-L from the Ty912 to the left telomere and a duplication of a terminal region of another chromosome arm [12] . In nearly all cases , these GCRs were the products of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by HR between Ty912 on chromosome V-L and an ectopic Ty element on a target chromosome . Using MLPA probes hybridizing to the telomeric ends of the chromosomes , we identified four chromosome arms ( the right arm of chromosome III , the right arm of chromosome V , the left arm of chromosome XIV , and the right arm of chromosome X ) that were the target of approximately 70% of the translocations in a wild-type strain and thus appeared to contain hotspots for HR events resulting in Ty912-mediated translocations . Detailed analysis using MLPA probes specific to these chromosome arms demonstrated that there were only 6 hotspots that mediated these translocations versus at least 254 potential targets for Ty-mediated translocations in the S . cerevisiae genome , and that furthermore , these hotspots were composed of Ty elements . We considered a number of potential explanations to account for the existence of the observed translocation hotspots; however , no single factor could explain the observed translocation target distributions . First , sequence homology with Ty912 did not explain the hotspots , as the target Ty elements at the hotspots did not share the highest degree of homology with Ty912 . Additionally , the target site distribution was relatively unaffected by an msh2Δ mutation that increased the efficiency of homeologous recombination , suggesting that the hotspot distribution was not determined by sequence homology . Second , the location of essential genes likely played little or no role in generating the target site distribution . The region of the left arm of chromosome V that is deleted in the GCRs detected by the assay contains only non-essential genes , and all of the translocations detected were non-reciprocal translocations that only duplicated other regions of the genome . Hence , no essential gene was ever observed to be deleted or would be expected to be deleted in this assay . Third , the distribution of centromere- ( 52 . 4% of Ty elements ) vs . telomere- ( 47 . 6% of Ty elements ) oriented Ty elements does not explain the distribution of target hotspots as almost all of the chromosome arms contain centromere- and telomere-oriented Ty elements , and the hotspot usage observed was significantly different compared to the distribution of all Ty elements as well as the distribution of only telomere-oriented Ty elements . Furthermore , translocations mediated by centromere-oriented Ty elements , which result in intermediate dicentric translocation chromosomes , were recovered using our assay , and at least 1 of the 6 observed translocation hotspots has been previously demonstrated to mediate the formation of dicentric translocations that undergo additional rounds of rearrangements [12] . Finally , analysis of the data from 4C experiments [36] showed that the spatial proximity of the hotspot targets relative to Ty912 on the left arm of chromosome V was also unable to explain the hotspots . Thus , target selection seems likely to reflect structural features of either individual Ty elements that are the targets of Ty-mediated translocations , or structural features of the region of the genome in which they reside . The translocation hotspots on chromosome III-R were located at two previously identified fragile sites ( FS1 and FS2 ) that were induced by down-regulation of the replicative DNA polymerases [14] , [15] . Consistent with previous studies [15] , [27] , [33] , each of these fragile sites contains a pair of Tys that were targeted by Ty912-mediated translocations , with FS1 containing 2 tandemly repeated Ty1 sequences and FS2 containing a pair of inverted Ty1 sequences separated by a short spacer sequence . The fact that we identified these same two fragile sites using our assay that detects spontaneous rearrangements implies that these sites are also fragile under conditions of normal DNA replication . We previously suggested that Ty912-mediated translocations might occur by a mechanism in which a broken chromosome V was repaired by break-induced replication ( BIR ) in which the Ty912 on a broken chromosome V promotes strand invasion at the site of ectopic Ty elements and primes DNA synthesis , resulting in copying the terminal region of the target chromosome from the target Ty element to the telomere onto the end of the broken chromosome V [12] . However , the observation that FS1 and FS2 are hotspots for Ty912-mediated translocations suggests at least two other possible mechanisms: HR between two DSBs , one on chromosome III-R and one on chromosome V-L , or BIR initiated by a DSB at either FS1 or FS2 that then invades chromosome V at Ty912 and is followed by loss of the intact chromosome V left by BIR during the selection for the GCR . The fact that another Ty hotspot on chromosome X-R also appears to contain tandem Ty1 elements ( YJRWTy1-1 and YJRWTy1-2 ) ( Table 1 ) suggests that this site might also represent a fragile site , although other there are Ty1 loci in the genome that also contain tandem Ty1 sequences and these did not appear to be translocation target hotspots sites . The hotspot on chromosome XIV-L and the two hotspots on chromosome V-R , one of which has previously been observed as a target of Ty-mediated translocations [9] , [12] , [26] , are not annotated to contain tandem or inverted Ty elements and it is not clear what causes these sites to act as translocation hotspots . We previously observed that a large proportion of Ty912-mediated translocations were mediated by RAD52-dependent HR and we obtained genetic evidence that a RAD51–dependent HR pathway primarily suppressed Ty-mediated translocations in wild-type strains , whereas a RAD59–dependent HR pathway promoted Ty-mediated translocations in the absence of RAD51 . In agreement with this , we found that a rad51Δ mutation increased both the rate of accumulation and the diversity of chromosome arm duplications , and that a rad59Δ mutation decreased the rate of most of the individual types of GCRs that occurred in a rad51Δ mutant . Interestingly , in the rad51Δ mutant , several of the chromosome arms that were duplicated at increased rates did not have full-length Ty1 elements but only contained solo delta elements ( chrVII-L , chrIX-L , chrXI-L , and chrXII-L ) . As RAD59-dependent HR promotes SSA between short repeat sequences [50] this raises the possibility that some of the translocation targets that show increased targeting in the rad51Δ mutant may reflect increased rates of HR between short repeated sequences mediated by RAD59-mediated HR . The majority of the GCRs isolated from rad51Δ and rad59Δ single mutants and rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant strains were the result of nonreciprocal translocations between Ty912 and ectopic Tys like those seen in wild-type strains . A striking finding was the almost complete elimination of translocations mediated by the chromosome III-R hotspots in the rad51Δ mutant in contrast to the other GCRs , including those mediated by the other translocation hotspots whose rates were increased in the rad51Δ mutant and decreased in the rad51Δ rad59Δ double mutant . This suggests that structural features of the translocation targets affect the mechanism of translocation . For example , the chromosome III-R hotspot may be a particularly good substrate for BIR given that the translocations mediated by this hotspot were highly dependent on RAD51 , consistent with prior results [16] , [24] , [51] , whereas the other translocation targets might be more amenable to aberrant repair by RAD59-dependent single-stranded annealing ( SSA ) of broken chromosomes at the site of Ty elements [50] , [52] , [53] . The results described here also support the idea that Ty-mediated translocations can occur via a RAD52-independent HR pathway . Deletion of RAD52 reduced the rate of Ty-mediated GCRs significantly below the wild-type rate , although not completely to the level observed in a rad52Δ mutant in the absence of the Ty912 element . Consistent with this , a significant proportion of GCRs in a rad52Δ mutant with the Ty912 present appeared to result from de novo telomere addition after chromosome breakage . However , there was also a significant fraction of translocations mediated by HR between Ty912 and ectopic Ty elements in a rad52Δ mutant . These Ty-mediated translocations were the same types of translocations seen in wild-type strains . At first glance , our data suggest that the Ty912-mediated GCRs in a rad52Δ mutant might occur by the same type of RAD52-independent recombination seen for other repetitive elements , which is believed to involve SSA followed by half-crossover mechanism [54] , [55] . However , simultaneous deletion of both RAD51 and RAD59 , or deletion of RAD1 ( which can promote SSA by removal of nonhomologous DNA flaps [56] ) , in the rad52Δ mutant did not reduce the GCR rate further and resulted in distributions of GCRs that were similar to that seen in the rad52Δ single mutant . Furthermore , we demonstrated that several of the translocations seen in the rad52Δ rad51Δ rad59Δ triple mutant were due to HR between Ty912 and ectopic Ty elements . This suggests that there might be other mechanisms for promoting recombination or that other nucleases besides Rad1–Rad10 can cleave off non-homologous tails that form during SSA [57] , [58] . Previous studies have observed occasional examples of strains containing GCRs and independent whole chromosome duplications [12] , [18] , [23] . In the present study , we used MLPA to detect whole chromosome duplications in large numbers of independent GCR-containing rtt109Δ-derived isolates . We found a statistically significant association of GCRs and whole chromosome duplications in these isolates . Because an rtt109Δ mutation caused an increase in the accumulation of whole chromosome duplications , but the presence of a whole chromosome duplication did not increase the GCR rate of an rtt109Δ mutant , and because the presence of GCRs did not increase the accumulation of whole chromosome duplications in an rtt109Δ mutant , it seems likely that in an rtt109Δ mutant , whole chromosome duplications tend to arise with GCRs . RTT109 encodes a histone H3 lysine 56 acetylase [41] , [42] and our analysis demonstrated that the suppression of GCRs and the suppression of whole chromosome duplications associated with GCRs was due to the role of the Rtt109-Asf1 complex in the acetylation of H3K56 . The mechanism by which acetylation of H3K56 suppresses GCRs and aneuploidy is currently unclear; however , the observation that rtt109Δ mutants have defects in recovery from DNA damage induced checkpoint activation [43] , [44] , [59] , but are not DNA repair defective per se , suggests aberrant recovery from arrest due to the DNA damage that results in GCRs might also result in mis-segregation of chromosomes during mitosis . \\n General methods have been previously described [7] , [11] , [12] , [60] . Genomic DNA preparations were quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer ( Invitrogen ) . All strains used in this study were derivatives of S288c and are described in Table S12 . Plasmids pFX04 and pFX06 [61] were used to create hht2::H3K56G HHF2 and hht2:H3K56R HHF2 strains . Ty1 fusion junctions were amplified with Velocity DNA Polymerase ( Bioline ) using the following protocol: 2 min 98°C initial denaturation step; 25 cycles of 12 sec 98°C denaturation , 30 sec 63 . 8°C annealing , 3 min 30 sec 72°C extension; final 4 min 72°C extension . Primer design followed the recommendations for synthetic-probes available on the MRC-Holland website ( http://www . mrc-holland . com ) , with the exception that the minimum length differences between amplification products was designed to be 2 base pairs . All primers were purchased and synthesized by ValueGene ( http://www . valuegene . com ) . We designed a total of six sets of primers . Two primer sets were designed to detect copy number variation of different chromosome arms . The set of 32 telomeric probe pairs ( Table S1; Figure 1b ) was designed to hybridize to unique sequence located between chromosome telomeres and the most distal Ty1 or solo delta elements; four probes ( corresponding to the left arm of chromosome II , the right arm of chromosome IV , the right arm of chromosome IX , and the left arm of chromosome XV ) were designed to hybridize centromeric to the most distal Ty1 or solo delta elements due to the lack of suitable unique sequence in the preferred region . The set of 32 centromeric probe pairs ( Table S9; Figure 1b ) was designed to hybridize to unique sequence located centromeric to the Ty1 or solo delta elements closest to the centromere of each chromosome arm . Ty2 elements were represented in this analysis as two independent solo delta elements per Ty2 element as these delta elements contain the majority of the homology between Ty2 and Ty1 elements . We also designed four primer sets capable of pinpointing duplications along whole chromosome arms for chromosomes III-R , V-R , X-R , and XIV-L ( Tables S3 , S5 , S6 , S7 , respectively ) . These primer sets generally contained pairs of probes that hybridized immediately telomeric and centromeric to each Ty1 and solo delta element on the pertinent chromosome arm ( Figure 3a–3d ) . All amplification reagents were purchased from MRC-Holland ( http://www . mrc-holland . com ) . The MLPA reaction has been previously described for human genomic DNA [32] . Briefly , probes are hybridized to chromosomal DNA , ligated , and amplified by PCR using universal priming sequences ( Figure 1c ) . Modifications for analysis of S . cerevisiae genomic DNA were as follows: 5 ng of template genomic DNA was used instead of 50–100 ng; a 10 min initial 98°C denaturation step was used instead of 5 min; 23 ( for chromosome arm specific probe sets ) or 25 ( for telomeric or centromeric probe sets ) PCR cycles were used instead of 35 cycles; and , importantly , the use of thin walled PCR tube strips and plates . Fragment separation was carried out as suggested by MRC-Holland on an ABI 3730XL sequencer using POP7 polymer and GS500-LIZ sizing standard ( ABI ) . 8 . 95 µl of Hi-Di Formamide ( ABI ) and 0 . 05 µl of GS500-LIZ sizing standard were mixed with 1 µl of the MLPA PCR product per isolate for a total volume of 10 µl . Then an 82°C heat denaturation step was performed for 2 minutes followed by an incubation step at 4°C for 5 minutes before analysis on the ABI3730XL sequencer instead of the suggested 80°C/4°C steps . Raw peak data for each run was obtained via the GeneMapper software from ABI . Data analysis was performed using Python ( version> = 2 . 5 ) and as described by MRC-Holland ( http://www . mrc-holland . com ) . The observed rate of the duplication of each chromosomal arm for a strain was taken to be the total CanR 5FOAR rate of the strain multiplied by the fraction of GCRs associated with the duplication of that chromosomal arm . The expected rate of a test strain relative to a control strain was calculated by multiplying the observed duplication rate for each chromosome arm in the control strain by a scaling constant . The scaling constant was the sum of the rates of the duplications of all chromosome arms in the test strain divided by the sum of the rates of the duplications of all chromosome arms in the control strain . This scaling constant was very similar to the ratio of CanR 5FOAR rates of the test and control strains for those strains dominated by GCRs associated with chromosome arm duplications , but properly handles mutations like rad52Δ which results in a substantial fraction of GCRs lacking chromosome arm duplications . In cases where no duplications for an individual chromosome arm were found in the control strain , then the expected rate was estimated as the upper limit of the duplication rate of that chromosomal arm ( the total CanR 5FOAR rate divided by the number of duplications ) . In cases where no chromosome arm duplication was found in the test strain , then the upper limit of the rate was used if it was less than the expected rate , otherwise the ratio of observed vs . expected rates was set to 1 . In cases where no duplications for an individual chromosome arm were found in both the test and control strain , then the ratio of observed vs . expected rates was set to 1 . R ( version≥2 . 11 . 1 ) was used to calculate p-values for Wilcoxon rank-sum tests , Fisher exact tests , the Monte Carlo sampling of multinomial distributions , the Hypergeometric test and the Binomial calculation . Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for the median GCR rates were calculated using a two-sided nonparametric test ( http://www . math . unb . ca/~knight/utility/MedInt95 . htm ) . Individual chromosome arm duplication rates were considered to be statistically significantly different from the bulk rate of a mutant if the calculated individual chromosome arm duplication rates fell outside the transformed 95% confidence interval of the bulk fold rate of the mutant strain .   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Similarly to protein folding , the association of two proteins is driven by a free energy funnel , determined by favorable interactions in some neighborhood of the native state . We describe a docking method based on stochastic global minimization of funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions ( SE ( 3 ) ) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains . The method , called semi-definite programming-based underestimation ( SDU ) , employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling . While SDU effectively minimizes functions with funnel-shaped basins , its application to docking in the rotational and translational space SE ( 3 ) is not straightforward due to the geometry of that space . We introduce a strategy that uses separate independent variables for side-chain optimization , center-to-center distance of the two proteins , and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules . The removal of the center-to-center distance turns out to vastly improve the efficiency of the search , because the five-dimensional space now exhibits a well-behaved energy surface suitable for underestimation . This algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima and shows similarity to the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions . Results for standard protein docking benchmarks establish that in this space the free energy landscape is a funnel in a reasonably broad neighborhood of the native state and that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation while achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods . \\n A minimization approach which is specific to funnel-like functions can be based on the concept of underestimation . The existence of a funnel implies that the free energy can be locally underestimated by a convex function ( Figure 1 ) . The original free energy function is extremely rugged with a huge number of local minima even in a small region of conformational space . Yet its convex underestimator is much smoother and still captures the overall funnel-like landscape , which provides a handle to free energy minimization . The quality of minimization through underestimation depends on the choice of underestimator functions , the way they are constructed and utilized to locate the global minimum , as well as how structured the free energy funnels are in conformational space . The Convex Global Underestimation ( CGU ) method [26] employed canonical quadratic functions as underestimators without any cross-terms . In that case the underestimator , based on a set of local minima , can be constructed by solving a Linear Programming ( LP ) problem . Uniformly distributed samples in the neighborhood of the underestimator's global minimum were then used to bias further sampling . The process was iterated with the set of local minima being updated , and the search region being reduced until certain convergence criteria are satisfied . CGU has been a very promising method with various applications in molecular structure prediction , including protein folding [27] and docking small molecules to proteins [28] . However , its restriction of using canonical quadratic functions limits its success in some cases [29] , since the principal axes of the free energy surface are not necessarily aligned with the canonical coordinates . The performance further deteriorates as the dimensionality of the search space increases . We have used theoretical analysis to show and simple test problems to demonstrate that this restriction can lead to incorrect convergence [30] . Motivated by the potential advantages of underestimation and practical shortcomings of the CGU algorithm , we have recently extended the method using general quadratic underestimators and introduced biased sampling guided by the underestimator [30] , [31] . Since the tightest underestimator in this class is obtained by solving a semi-definite programming problem , the method is termed SDU ( Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation ) . Semi-definite programming is computationally more demanding than the linear programming ( still solvable in polynomial-time though ) used in the CGU method . However , SDU typically requires fewer iterations and substantially improves optimization performance . The SDU method starts from a set of K local minima x1 , … , xK of a funnel-like function f ( x ) : within a given region of the search space . Throughout the course of the algorithm we maintain a set of local minima in the search region; initially . To capture the global funnel-like structure of f ( x ) within we construct a smooth ( convex ) quadratic function U ( x ) = x′Qx+b′x+c , where Q is a positive semi-definite matrix , , c is a scalar , and prime denotes transpose , such that U ( x ) underestimates f ( x ) at all local minima in , i . e . , U ( xi ) ≤f ( xi ) for all i = {1 , 2 , … , K} . The tightest possible underestimator ( with an L1 norm metric ) can be found by solving a semi-definite programming problem [30] . U ( x ) is a general convex quadratic function . The underestimator U is used to guide further sampling . The minimum of U , denoted by xP and referred to as the predictive conformation , is in an energetically favorable region , and hence a new conformation can be generated by local minimization starting from xP . Additional conformations are obtained by local minimization with randomly generated starting points such that points in the vicinity of xP have a higher probability of being selected than points further away . To that end , we simply sample within using a density function shaped as −U . The set is being updated by adding these newly obtained conformations while removing unfavorable ( i . e . , higher energy ) conformations , and the search area is being reduced to a neighborhood of xP . Using the updated conformations in we repeat the underestimation step and the whole process is being iterated until a convergence criterion is met . The SDU algorithm has a number of favorable properties when applied to funnel-shaped functions . Theoretical analysis shows [30] that xP converges in probability to the global minimum x* of the funnel-like function f as the number of samples K grows . When applied to test functions resembling the funnel-like free energy functions , SDU has been shown outperforming CGU and a simulated annealing algorithm which adaptively tunes its parameters , with much less required function evaluations and much higher success rates [30] . The main goal of this paper is to develop and test docking methods that use the SDU algorithm in order to find the global minimum of a funnel-like function approximating the free energy over regions of the conformational space . Over the last few years we have developed a multistage docking method that starts with rigid body search based on Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) , selects and clusters 1000 to 2000 low energy docked structures , and retains the 10 to 30 largest clusters for further processing [32] . The conformational space is decomposed into separate regions defined by the clusters , where free energy attraction basins are believed to exist and the free energy landscape is assumed to be funnel-like . Then SDU is called upon to locate the global minimum within each region , by utilizing such funnel-like behavior . As will be shown , in spite of the success of SDU as an optimizer for functions with funnel-shaped basins , its application to docking turned out to be far from straightforward . Although the method yields meaningful moves in either translational or rotational subspaces [30] , minimization in the full 6D space of rigid body motions poses a challenge . This difficulty is well known in the robotics literature [33] . The Euclidean group SE ( 3 ) , which is the semidirect product of ( translations ) and the special orthogonal Euclidean group SO ( 3 ) ( rotations ) , is a nonlinear manifold and its parametrization is critical to any optimization procedure [33] . In particular , we will show that the funnel-like shape of the free energy surface is affected by the parameterization of the search space , and that underestimation tends to fail unless appropriate parameters are selected . We will describe two implementations of the SDU method: ( i ) SDU1 , a cyclic coordinate descent strategy where rotational and translational moves alternate; and ( ii ) SDU2 , a 5D strategy in which the distance of the two proteins is separately optimized and the SDU-driven search is performed in a lower dimensional space defined by 5 angular coordinates . Since the most energetically favorable distances occur when the two proteins are in contact but do not overlap , this strategy explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes [15] . Results will show that the methods discover broad energy funnels , generate high quality docking predictions , and produce a substantial efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods . The comparison with Monte Carlo methods is based on our earlier preliminary work [34] where we have tested a method similar to SDU1 against a 10-protein set using reduced Gō-type potentials . Even with these relatively smooth potentials , underestimation in the full 6D space has not been effective , and we had to rely on optimizing in each ( rotational or translational ) subspace separately . In the present paper , we show that the SDU1 strategy is effective against a larger benchmark set using much more refined energy potentials . However , our main contribution is the introduction of SDU2 which is more effective and improves efficiency by a factor of 10 compared to SDU1 . In addition , SDU2 provides interesting biophysical insights with its resemblance to docking by repeated micro-collisions . \\n To define the docking problem we fix the position and orientation of the first ( receptor ) protein . The six-dimensional vector x specifies the position and orientation of the second ( ligand ) protein . The variables s account for the side chain conformations in both proteins , and ΔG ( x , s ) denotes the free energy function . The minimization of ΔG ( x , s ) with respect to s is restricted to the side chains in the interface and is carried out by local methods . We define ΔG* ( x ) = ΔG ( x , s* ) , where s* is an optimal solution; then the protein docking problem is finding the lowest minimum of ΔG* ( x ) in the region defined by the cluster , where x belongs to the space of rigid body motions , i . e . , the Euclidean group SE ( 3 ) . As described before , the parameterization of SE ( 3 ) is critical for optimization purposes , and hence we first describe our results concerning the parameterization of the search space . The space SE ( 3 ) is the semidirect product of ( translations ) and SO ( 3 ) ( rotations ) . The rotation group SO ( 3 ) is a 3-dimensional Lie group consisting of rotation matrices , i . e , , RR′ = I , det ( R ) = 1 . The Lie algebra of SO ( 3 ) , denoted by so ( 3 ) , may be represented by the real skew-symmetric matriceswhere . It is well-known that the one-parameter subgroups of SO ( 3 ) , i . e . , are geodesics [33] , [35] , [36] , i . e . , the shortest paths between two points on SO ( 3 ) . Moreover , for R0 , R1∈SO ( 3 ) , Ω = log ( R0′R1 ) ∈so ( 3 ) and the distance between R0 and R1 can be defined by ρ ( R0 , R1 ) = ∥log ( R0′R1 ) ∥ = ∥ω1−ω0∥ . This distance is a natural Riemannian metric on SO ( 3 ) , i . e . , it is bi-invariant with respect to the actions of the group ( rotations ) . The exponential map from so ( 3 ) to SO ( 3 ) defined by Ω → R0eΩ is a local diffeomorphism , i . e . , there exist an open neighborhood of 0∈so ( 3 ) and an open neighborhood of R0∈SO ( 3 ) and an invertible , surjective , and smooth map from one neighborhood to the other whose inverse is also smooth . The local diffeomorphism induces a coordinate chart in a neighborhood of R0 that is known as exponential coordinate system . Given the definition of so ( 3 ) this coordinate system can be parameterized by . Given the favorable properties of SO ( 3 ) ( more generally SO ( n ) ) such as the existence of a natural bi-invariant metric and , in particular , the simplicity of determining the geodesics of the manifold , the standard gradient based optimization algorithms on can be generalized for optimization on SO ( n ) [35] . However , generalization to the entire SE ( 3 ) is more difficult [33] , [36] . Although SE ( 3 ) is also Lie group , its one-parameter subgroups are no longer geodesics . Moreover , SE ( 3 ) does not admit a natural ( bi-invariant ) Riemannian metric while its subspaces SO ( 3 ) and do [33] , [36] . Attempting to implement SDU to SE ( 3 ) by simultaneous translational and rotational optimization , we have generally failed to construct useful underestimators . We have , however , found two strategies that were able to overcome this problem . The SDU1 and SDU2 algorithms were tested on the protein pairs given in protein docking benchmark sets [38] , [39] that contain enzyme–inhibitor , antigen–antibody , and “other” types of complexes , using the independently determined ( unbound ) structures of the component proteins . The algorithms were used to refine the top ( most populated ) clusters of docked structures generated by the rigid body docking program PIPER [22] . We consider the 10 largest clusters for enzyme–inhibitor complexes , and 30 clusters for antigen–antibody and “other” complexes . Table 1 shows results both from the rigid body docking and the SDU-based refinement procedures for all three types of complexes , each defined by its Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) code [5] in Column 1 of Table 1 . We emphasize that for most complexes we docked the unbound ( separately crystallized ) protein structures rather than their bound conformations obtained by separating the complex . The exceptions are mostly a few antigen–antibody complexes for which no separate antibody structures were available and hence were taken from the complex . However , even in these cases we used the separately crystallized structure of the antigen as given in the benchmark sets [38] , [39] . PDB codes for these “semi-bound” complexes are shown in bold italic fonts in Table 1 . Columns 2–4 of Table 1 describe the docked complex structures generated by the rigid body docking [22] before any refinement . As described in the Methods , the PIPER docking program evaluates the energy for billions of docked conformations . We retain the 1000 best scoring structures , and cluster them using the pairwise RMSD as the distance measure and an optimally selected clustering radius . We have observed that the near-native structures tend to be in one of the largest clusters , and hence rank the clusters on the basis of their size . In fact , calculated for the rigid protein structures , the energy function is approximate , and better discrimination of the native structures can be achieved by focusing on the large clusters . The properties shown in Table 1 are the number of near-native conformations ( or “hits” with less than 10 Å ligand interface Cα RMSD ) among the 1000 best scoring structures retained from the PIPER results , the Root Mean Square deviation ( RMSD ) between the native ligand structure and the docked structure at the center of the first cluster that includes a near-native conformation , and the rank of the particular cluster based on cluster size . Results are fairly good for enzyme–inhibitor complexes , as the 1000 structures , on the average , include over 200 hits , and the average RMSD is less than 5 Å between the native structure and the center of one of the three largest clusters . Although PIPER yields almost 200 hits for the “other” types of complexes , discrimination by cluster size is more difficult , and retaining the top 6 clusters results in 6 . 16 Å average RMSD . For antibody-antigen complexes PIPER generates much fewer hits , and on the average we have to retain 15 clusters to have a near-native structure in them . The next 6 columns in Table 1 show the results for the SDU1 and SDU2 algorithms , in each case listing the RMSD for the lowest energy conformation in the first cluster that includes a near-native structure , the rank of the cluster , and the average number n̅ of function evaluations . It is important to note that after the SDU refinement the clusters are ranked based on the energies of the SDU solutions rather than on cluster size . For comparison we also generated 2000 conformations ( based on the original protocol ) for each complex using version 2 . 3 of the rigid body docking program ZDOCK [21] , and refined the structures using RDOCK [40] , which performs local energy minimization . The last two columns of Table 1 show the RMSD of the first near-native structure found and its rank based on the RDOCK energy function . For enzyme–inhibitor complexes both SDU1 and SDU2 give excellent results . On the average , the RMSD is reduced by almost 1 Å and the average rank is around 2 . As the overall performance measure of the refinement we consider the number of complexes that have at least one prediction with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα RMSD from the native structure in the top 5 clusters . Such predictions would be termed “5 Å models” later for simplicity . As noted , the clusters of PIPER-generated structures are ranked based on their size ( i . e . , the number of structures ) . However , after the refinement the clusters are ranked based on the energy of their lowest energy structures . Among the PIPER-generated structures the top 5 clusters include less than 5 Å ligand interface RMSD predictions for only 11 of the 25 enzyme–inhibitor complexes . As shown in Table 1 , both SDU1 and SDU2 increase this number to 17 , i . e . , a more than 50% improvement relative to the PIPER results . Notice that the 5 lowest energy predictions obtained by the ZDOCK/RDOCK procedure include 5 Å models only for 7 complexes . However , from the ZDOCK/RDOCK runs we retain low energy models , whereas the results provided by SDU1 and SDU2 are low energy clusters , and ranking clusters rather than individual structures generally removes some false positives , i . e . , conformations that have low energy but are far from the native . It is well known that antigen–antibody and “other” complexes are more difficult to predict than enzyme–inhibitor complexes [20] . For antibody-antigen pairs only the refinement by SDU2 improves the PIPER results . Although both the RMSD and the average rank of the first near-native cluster are reduced , at 12 . 7 the latter remains high ( Table 1 ) . Similarly , for the complexes in the “other” category only SDU2 improves both the RMSD and the rank . Even SDU2 yields only a total of seven 5 Å models in the top five clusters for antibody–antigen and “other” types of complexes . This result is somewhat disappointing , but note that docking by ZDOCK and refining by RDOCK leads to 5 Å models only for three complexes , and no near-native solution is found in four cases . Figure 2 shows the RMSD vs . calculated free energy for the 25 enzyme–inhibitor complexes . Again we show PDB codes for the “semi-bound” complexes in bold italic fonts . Each point represents a structure sampled in the process of refining the 10 largest clusters using the SDU2 algorithm . The encircled blue asterisk indicates the native structure and the first hit is shown as a red square . In spite of the one-dimensional representation of the energy function defined in the 6D rotational and translational space , the figure demonstrates the multi-funnel behavior over a relatively broad region ( within 20 Å RMSD ) of the native state . For most complexes the figure shows a well defined deep funnel within 5 Å RMSD from the native structure . According to Table 1 , for 12 of the 25 complexes ( including 5 “semi-bound” cases ) , this funnel is deepest among the 10 clusters sampled . For example , for 4HTC the near-native cluster is the 7th largest , but it is energetically the most favorable after refinement . For the remaining 13 complexes , clusters farther from the native structure yield the deepest funnels , resulting in false positive predictions . One of the worst behaviors can be observed for 2PTC with the first near-native cluster ranked 4 , and Figure 2 shows a number of deep non-native funnels . However , on the average , one of the 3 deepest funnels is near-native ( Table 1 ) . This also shows the power of heuristic combination of entropic and enthalpic measurement , i . e . , cluster size as a filter and refined cluster depth as ranking parameter . Figure 3 shows the RMSD vs . calculated free energy for the antigen–antibody and “other” complexes , sampled in the refinement of the 30 largest clusters by SDU2 . All but 1SPB and 2BTF have multiple funnels , and the funnels are further from the native state than for enzyme–inhibitor pairs , demonstrating the well-known difficulty of estimating free energy using simple models , particularly for antigen–antibody complexes . Adjusting the conformation of interface side chains only by local minimization and keeping the backbone rigid also limits the accuracy of free energy calculation . As shown in Table 1 , the SDU2 strategy is much more efficient than SDU1 , and also provides substantially better results for the more difficult problem of docking antigen–antibody and “other” complexes . These differences are demonstrated in Figure 4A and 4B that show , for the near-native cluster of the complex 4HTC , the conformations sampled and minimized by each algorithm . The horizontal and vertical axes , respectively , represent translational and rotational distances between each sampled ligand conformation and the one in the native structure , the latter placed at the origin of this coordinate system . The rotational distance here is defined as the length of the minimum geodesic ( i . e . , the minimum rotation in radian ) between two rotations [36] . As discussed earlier , this distance between R0 and R1 can be defined by ρ ( R0 , R1 ) = ∥log ( R0′R1 ) ∥ = ∥ω1−ω0∥ . The points are color-coded according to their energies , from low ( blue ) to high ( red ) energy structures . As shown in Figure 4A , the separate treatment of translational and rotational subspaces in the SDU1 algorithm is highly inefficient , resulting in the sampling of many conformations with relatively high energies . Although all energy values shown are obtained by local minimization , the latter is unable to reduce the energy if the two proteins are too far from each other , which frequently occurs with the SDU1 algorithm . In addition , as indicated by the parallel lines , very similar translational regions are re-sampled at slightly different rotational coordinates , and vice versa . In contrast , as shown in Figure 4B , the SDU2 algorithm smoothly and efficiently descends toward the bottom of the free energy funnel . Based on the ranges of sampled free energy values , SDU2 sampled much lower energy regions compared to SDU1 . Since the search is restricted to biophysically meaningful encounter complexes , the more consistent energy values facilitate the construction of better underestimators during the search . According to Figure 4B , for SDU2 there is a clear trend that structures closer to the native complex generally have lower energies , resulting in a deep and broad free energy funnel in this space . The existence of such free energy funnels is much less obvious , even in each separate subspace , when sampled by the SDU1 algorithm ( Figure 4A ) . In test docking problems even the slower SDU1 algorithm outperformed a standard Monte Carlo method by reducing the number of function evaluations by a factor of two [34] . As shown in Table 1 , SDU2 further reduces the computational costs by a factor of 11 to 15 , depending on the type of complex . Since most of the computational time is spent in energy evaluations , the computational gain of SDU2 over SDU1 is more than a factor of 10 , and we estimate that SDU2 achieves more than 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods . We tested our algorithms on a 128-node biowulf cluster ( IBM eServer×Series ) . Each node contains dual 1 GHz PIII processors with 2 GB memory . A typical refinement by SDU2 for each PIPER-generated cluster would take 2 to 6 processor-hours . The running time varies with the protein complex size ( especially the interface size ) and the number of iterations before convergence . Notice that on the average SDU2 samples only about 100 encounter structures for each cluster . No particular efforts have been made to accelerate either the interface side-chain search or the line search to determine the center-to-center distance . The CPU times can be compared to those reported for a server [41] based on the RosettaDock algorithm [42] . The server performs 1000 independent Monte Carlo simulations within 30 Å Cα RMSD of a starting structure , as described in the RosettaDock protocol [42] . A typical run requires about 65 processor-hours . SDU based docking algorithms are stochastic in nature . Although we gave a theoretical guarantee of probabilistic convergence to the global minimum of funnel-like functions under some fairly general conditions [30] , practical protein docking problems do not necessarily satisfy all these conditions . To check the variations in our results we have repeatedly run SDU2 to refine the near-native cluster from PIPER ( columns 3 and 4 in Table 1 ) for 10 randomly selected complexes , including 4 enzyme–inhibitor , 4 antigen–antibody and 2 “other” complexes . SDU2 was run 10 times independently for each complex with the same set of parameters . The results ( ligand interface Cα RMSD versus corresponding free energy values ) are shown in Figure 5 , where black circles represent the rigid body predictions from PIPER before refinement and blue asterisks represent the independent SDU2 predictions . Some of the latter overlap , resulting in less than 10 distinct solutions . SDU2 is able to lower the free energy values in all cases and to improve RMSD in most of them . Table 2 shows the mean ( indicated by overline ) and the standard deviation ( indicated by σ ) for both the ligand interface RMSD and the free energy for each complex . Although the average standard deviation is relatively large ( about 4 . 4 Kcal/mol ) for free energies , it is less than 0 . 5 Å for RMSDs . This result indicates a good level of robustness , considering that our free energy model does not discriminate among structures within 1 Å RMSD from each other . Note that the SDU-based algorithms rely more on the collective distribution of a set of encounter structures in the free energy funnel , rather than on a single low energy structure , which reduces the sensitivity of the results to the variations in the starting structures . The successful application of the Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation ( SDU ) search algorithm to protein–protein docking further validates the assumption that the free energy landscape of the complex is a funnel in some neighborhood of the native state . However , the direct application of SDU in the space SE ( 3 ) of rotations and translations fails to yield useful underestimators . Alternating searches in rotational and translational subspaces yields a feasible but inefficient algorithm . We have substantially improved performance by separately optimizing the center-to-center distance and describing SE ( 3 ) in terms of five angles . It is potentially important that this strategy samples encounter complexes , and hence it is reminiscent of the model of molecular association through a series of micro-collisions [37] . Results emphasize that the funnel-like shape of the free energy surface seen in this parameterization of SE ( 3 ) is largely lost when changing to the straightforward description of the space in terms of rotational and translational coordinates . The underestimation approach has been used in the latest rounds of CAPRI with considerable success [19] , [43] , and it provides a promising platform for improving docking methods . We note that Marcia et al . [44] recently reported the application of SDU to the docking problem using the general quadratic underestimation method we have earlier developed [30] , [31] . However , the central problem of parameterizing the search space was not discussed and the method was applied only to five bound docking problems using co-crystallized structures , which is much easier than docking two separately crystallized proteins . In fact , we believe that the separate minimization along the center-to-center vector and the use of five angular descriptors can improve the performance of any minimization algorithm used for docking . \\n The SDU1 and SDU2 algorithms were tested on complexes from the protein docking benchmark sets [38] , [39] . These sets contain enzyme–inhibitor , antigen–antibody , and “other” types of complexes . As described , the algorithms were used to refine the separate clusters generated by the rigid body docking program PIPER . For enzyme–inhibitor complexes we refined only the 10 largest clusters and hence restricted consideration to complexes from the two benchmark sets for which these clusters included at least one near-native conformation . In addition , we disregarded four enzyme–inhibitor pairs that form oligomeric rather than binary complexes , resulting in the 25 test problems . The refinement algorithms were also applied to 11 antigen–antibody and 8 “other” type of complexes from the benchmark set 1 [38] that had at least one near-native structure in the 30 largest clusters . We emphasize that tests for most complexes involved separately determined protein structures as given in the benchmark sets [38] , [39] . The exceptions are a few of the antigen–antibody complexes in which the antigen was separately solved but the antibody structure was taken from the complex . The rigid body docking program PIPER [22] , based on the FFT correlation approach , systematically samples billions of docked conformations on a grid . Compared with other FFT-based approaches that use only shape complementarity and electrostatics for scoring , the scoring function in PIPER also includes the statistical pairwise potential DARS ( Decoy As Reference States ) [22] . Since the potential is represented as the sum of a few correlation functions through the eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition of the matrix of the DARS interactions energy coefficients , the energy can be very efficiently evaluated using Fourier transforms . In conjunction with this higher accuracy scoring function , the PIPER program significantly enriches the hit rates among top ranked predictions for the benchmark sets described above . For each complex , we retained the 1000 lowest energy predictions and clustered them using pairwise RMSD as the distance metric [45] . The resulting clusters were ranked based on their size , reflecting a preference for local minima with broad regions of attraction [32] . We have retained at most 30 clusters for each complex , each one being roughly 10 Å RMSD wide . Docking by the SDU algorithms involves the use of two different free energy models . In the rigid body global search the scoring function iswhere the desolvation free energy ΔGdes is estimated by the Atomic Contact Potential [49] , an atom-level extension of the Miyazawa-Jernigan potential [50] , the electrostatic energy ΔEelec is based on the Coulombic formula with distance-dependent dielectrics ϵ = 4r , and the Van der Waals term ΔEvdw is adopted from the Charmm potential [51] . The scaling factor λ∈[0 , 1] is dynamically adjusted during the course of the refinement to improve the quality of the underestimator by dampening the effect of the van der Waals term ΔEvdw and thereby smoothing ΔG . Specifically , whenever a “flat” underestimator U ( this can be determined when the minimum eigenvalue of Q is close to zero ) is being computed with λ = 1 , we gradually reduce λ with a stepsize of 0 . 1 until we obtain a more informative underestimator or λ reaches 0 . In the flexible local minimization we use the Charmm potential with ϵ = 4r , including the internal energy terms , and perform 100 steps of adopted base Newton-Raphson ( ABNR ) minimization allowing for side-chain flexibility in the interface [51] . The distance between two components is separately optimized . Specifically , the ligand is pushed towards or pulled apart from the receptor at a stepsize of 0 . 5 Å along the line segment connecting the two centers of mass . The maximum shift in distance ( which defines locality ) is 2 Å in this study . Each position is followed by a Charmm minimization described above and energy evaluation . Only non-clashing structures are accepted , judged by the condition ΔEvdw<0 . In fact , we found that PIPER had a higher tolerance toward clashing structures and pushing component proteins closer generally resulted in increased positive ΔEvdw . To reduce calls to Charmm minimization , in practice we only pull them apart if necessary , i . e . , when ΔEvdw>0 is found . For simplicity we will call the work involved in evaluating ΔG* ( x ) for each conformation x a function evaluation , although it generally involves several evaluations of ΔG ( x , s ) . As a measure of prediction quality , we select the ligand Cα atoms in the binding site , and calculate the RMSD between their predicted and observed positions . A ligand residue is considered to be in the binding site if any of its atom is within 10 Å of an atom on the receptor . We refer to a structure as near-native ( or a “hit” ) if its ligand binding site Cα RMSD is less than 10 Å . Although such structures are not really close to the native complex , by rigid body docking it is generally difficult to obtain better results . In fact , since the near-native binding region is selected by cluster size using a clustering radius on the order of 10 Å , the goal of this first step is to generate as many such 10 Å RMSD structures as possible . To show the improvements due to the SDU method , we list the rank of the first cluster that includes a hit , as well as the RMSD between the native structure and the center of the cluster . However , as a more appropriate overall performance measure of the refinement , we also note the number of complexes that have at least one prediction with less than 5 Å RMSD from the native structure in the top 5 clusters .   \n",

A key question in the field is how DNA sequence variants impact gene expression , with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence . By contrast , the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown , owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3′ untranslated regions . In this work , we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals . Our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ gene ends , finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements , including miRNA sites . The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals , and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay . Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation .    \n",

Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design .    \n",

Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease .    \n",
       "3     Between 2000–2007 , the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1 . 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of anti-filarial drugs ( albendazole , ivermectin , diethylcarbamazine ) to all at-risk for 4–6 years . Quantifying the resulting economic benefits of this significant achievement is important not only to justify the resources invested in the GPELF but also to more fully understand the Programme's overall impact on some of the poorest endemic populations . To calculate the economic benefits , the number of clinical manifestations averted was first quantified and the savings associated with this disease prevention then analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs , indirect costs of lost-labor , and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals . Multiple data sources were reviewed , including published literature and databases from the World Health Organization , International Monetary Fund , and International Labour Organization An estimated US$21 . 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31 . 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF . Of this total , over US$2 . 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission . Similarly , more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease , which results in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19 . 5 billion . In addition to these economic benefits to at-risk individuals , decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saves the health systems of endemic countries approximately US$2 . 2 billion . MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits . Moreover , with favorable program implementation costs ( largely a result of the sustained commitments of donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry ) it is clear that the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high and that this Programme continues to prove itself an excellent investment in global health .    \n",

Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD .    \n",

While bulk kinetic measurements rely on discrete state-like approximations to the energy landscape , single-molecule methods can project the free energy onto specific coordinates . With measures of the diffusion , one may establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape . We used an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome ( 2 . 1 million atoms; 1 . 3 microseconds ) to provide this bridge for specific conformational events associated with the process of tRNA translocation . Starting from a pre-translocation configuration , we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function . Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation were then used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape . This analysis , in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation , provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation . While this analysis was performed for a particular kinetic scheme of translocation , the quantitative framework is general and may be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states .    \n",

To explore genetic profiles of MTCs , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from MTC patients were assayed on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2 . Eighty-four sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues were successfully sequenced . We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples . The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene , which occurred in 47 cases followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ) , serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ) , v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ) , mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ) , Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ) and MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ) . We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) . Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH . To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5’ fusion partner of ALK , customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients . Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusions were identified . Additional PCR analysis , followed by Sanger sequencing , confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion , indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion . Notably , a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor , crizotinib . In conclusion , we found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC . Our results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors . Furthermore , the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy .    \n",

The role of these asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission , prognosis at individual level and rate of transformation to symptomatic VL/Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) needs to be evaluated . Asymptomatic cases were diagnosed by active mass survey in eight tribal villages by detecting antileishmanial antibody using rK39 based rapid diagnostic kits and followed up for three years to observe the pattern of sero-conversion and disease transformation . Out of 2890 total population , 2603 were screened . Antileishmanial antibody was detected in 185 individuals of them 96 had a history of VL/PKDL and 89 without such history . Seventy nine such individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis and ten as active VL with a ratio of 7 . 9:1 . Out of 79 asymptomatic cases 2 were lost to follow up as they moved to other places . Amongst asymptomatically infected persons , disease transformation in 8/77 ( 10 . 39% ) and sero-conversion in 62/77 ( 80 . 52% ) cases were noted . Seven ( 9 . 09% ) remained sero-positive even after three years . Progression to clinical disease among asymptomatic individuals was taking place at any time up to three years after the baseline survey . If there are no VL /PKDL cases for two or more years , it does not mean that the area is free from leishmaniasis as symptomatic VL or PKDL may appear even after three years , if there are such asymptomatic cases . So , asymptomatic infected individuals need much attention for VL elimination programme that has been initiated by three adjoining endemic countries .    \n",

We previously demonstrated that introduction of the repetitive retrotransposon Ty912 onto a nonessential chromosome arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to increased genome instability predominantly due to increased rates of formation of monocentric nonreciprocal translocations . In this study , we adapted Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ) to analyze a large numbers of these GCRs . Using MLPA , we found that the distribution of translocations induced by the presence of Ty912 in a wild-type strain was nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes , even though there were 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S . cerevisiae genome . While the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination , we observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements . The formation of these RAD52-independent translocations did not require the Rad51 or Rad59 homologous pairing proteins or the Rad1–Rad10 endonuclease complex that processes branched DNAs during recombination . Finally , we found that defects in ASF1-RTT109–dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 ( H3K56 ) resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications , and resulted in aneuploidy that tended to occur simultaneously with GCRs . Overall , we found that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy .    \n",

We describe a docking method based on stochastic global minimization of funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions ( SE ( 3 ) ) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains . The method , called semi-definite programming-based underestimation ( SDU ) , employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling . While SDU effectively minimizes functions with funnel-shaped basins , its application to docking in the rotational and translational space SE ( 3 ) is not straightforward due to the geometry of that space . We introduce a strategy that uses separate independent variables for side-chain optimization , center-to-center distance of the two proteins , and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules . The removal of the center-to-center distance turns out to vastly improve the efficiency of the search , because the five-dimensional space now exhibits a well-behaved energy surface suitable for underestimation . This algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima and shows similarity to the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions . Results for standard protein docking benchmarks establish that in this space the free energy landscape is a funnel in a reasonably broad neighborhood of the native state and that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation while achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods .    \n",

These differences can be due to changes in gene regulation. It is important to understand how these changes occur, and how they are related to gene expression. Most research on this topic has focused on the effects of genetic changes on the regions of DNA that control gene expression. However, less is known about the role of RNA processing in regulating gene expression. This is because it is difficult to identify functional elements in the regions of DNA that are not translated into proteins. In this study, researchers conducted an analysis of the ends of RNA molecules in lymphoblastoid cells from different human individuals. They found that the positions of these ends were not randomly located, but rather preferred to be close to certain regions of DNA that control gene expression. The usage of different RNA length forms and motifs in these regions varied across different individuals, and genetic changes in these regions were significant predictors of the expression levels of the genes. Independent experiments confirmed that genetic changes in these regions affected the expression levels of the genes. The researchers also looked at the gene IRF5, and how natural genetic variations in RNA processing affected the regulation of this gene in response to antigen stimulation. The researchers found that two mechanisms are at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of different 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate. The researchers suggest that the strategy of combining observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will be a useful tool in efforts to understand the human genome.  \n",

However, little is known about how this vaccine works. In this study, researchers used advanced technology to analyze the immune response of vaccinated animals. They found that the initial response was directed against regions of the virus that vary more widely, but as the virus evolved to escape the immune response, the response became more focused on regions of the virus that are highly conserved. This broadened the immune response to include more diverse regions of the virus, which is associated with better protection. These findings make SIVΔnef a useful model for researchers to study how vaccines can be designed to be more effective.  \n",

The immune system protects against these infections, but we do not know how to induce immunity against them. We used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) to study this. We found that the immune response is regulated by a molecule called interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R). IL-1R is important for controlling fungal growth at the beginning of the infection. This happens because IL-1R affects neutrophils in two ways: it helps neutrophils reach the site of the infection and it helps new neutrophils be made in the bone marrow. IL-1R-deficient mice had problems controlling fungal growth because they did not produce enough of a molecule called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and they did not make enough of a molecule called chemokines. G-CSF is made by endothelial cells, which are a type of cell found in the mouth. Chemokines are made by keratinocytes, which are another type of cell found in the mouth. Keratinocytes release IL-1α, which is important for G-CSF production by endothelial cells. We confirmed these findings in vitro using a new type of mouse cell called a keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. Together, these data show that IL-1R is important for regulating the immune response to fungal infections in the mouth and for protecting the host from these infections.  \n",

This disease is caused by a parasite and can lead to disabilities and other serious health problems. Between 2000 and 2007, the GPELF gave more than 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million people, which were given through an annual mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs (albendazole, ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine) to everyone at risk. \\nIt is important to know how much money this program saves by preventing lymphatic filariasis. To do this, researchers looked at how many people got treatments and how many people got better as a result of these treatments. They also looked at the cost of treating lymphatic filariasis, the cost of people not being able to work because of the disease, and the cost of treating people who were sick. They found that over 20 years, the program will save about $21.8 billion by treating about 31.4 million people. About $2.3 billion of this money comes from people who will never get lymphatic filariasis because they were born in areas where the disease is now gone. Another $19.5 billion comes from people who already have the disease, but will not get any worse because of the program. This program will also save health systems about $2.2 billion because people will not need to be treated as much anymore. \\nIn conclusion, treating lymphatic filariasis with the GPELF program saves a lot of money. This is because the cost of the program is low, due in part to the donation of drugs from the pharmaceutical industry. The economic return on this program is very high, which means that it is a great investment in public health.  \n",

Research has shown that certain genetic mutations that cause GD can also increase the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, researchers created a type of fish called medaka that lacked a protein called Gaucher disease-related protein (GCase), which is usually responsible for breaking down GC. Surprisingly, these GCase-deficient fish lived for several months, allowing researchers to study the development of GD-like symptoms in more detail. The fish showed many of the same symptoms as people with neuronopathic GD, including the buildup of Gaucher-like cells in the brain, progressive nerve cell loss, and microglia (a type of brain cell). These symptoms were caused by lysosomal problems in nerve cells and the accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein in swollen nerve cells. However, when researchers tried to remove alpha-synuclein from the fish, this did not improve their symptoms or extend their lifespan. This study provides new insights into the development of GD-like symptoms and the role of alpha-synuclein in GD.  \n",

While traditional measurements of these movements rely on the assumption that they occur between discrete states, single-molecule methods allow us to project the energy landscape onto specific coordinates. Using an all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of the 70S ribosome (2.1 million atoms, 1.3 microseconds) and previously reported experimental rates of tRNA translocation, we were able to estimate the free-energy barriers associated with translocation. This quantitative analysis can be applied to any kinetic and energetic descriptions, regardless of the number of intermediate states and transition states.  \n",
       "1372  Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is a rare type of thyroid cancer that originates from the C cells, which produce calcitonin. The genetic basis of MTC is not yet fully understood, but some mutations have been identified. To explore the genetic profiles of MTCs, the researchers analyzed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 84 MTC patients and 36 normal thyroid tissues using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. They discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples. The most common mutation was in the RET gene, followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threonine kinase 11, v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, mutL homolog 1, Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, and MET proto-oncogene. The researchers also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 98 screened cases. Two of the 98 cases were positive for ALK FISH. To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5’ fusion partner of ALK, customized targeted cancer panel sequencing was performed using DNA from tumor samples of the two patients. Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusions were identified. Additional PCR analysis followed by Sanger sequencing confirmed the GFPT1-ALK fusion, indicating that the fusion is a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. Notably, a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. In conclusion, the researchers found several genetic mutations in MTC and are the first to identify ALK fusions in MTC. Their results suggest that the EML4-ALK fusion in MTC may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target of ALK inhibitors. Furthermore, the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy.  \n",

The remaining 10% stayed sero-positive even after three years. This shows that asymptomatic carriers do play a role in the transmission of the disease, and can become symptomatic at any time up to three years after being initially screened. The study highlights the need for further attention to the asymptomatic infected individuals for the elimination of the disease.  \n",

Using a technique called Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ), we found that the majority of translocations caused by Ty912 were mediated by only six targets on four different chromosomes, even though there were 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the genome. While most of these translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination, we also found a small number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements. Remarkably, we found that defects in ASF1-RTT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 (H3K56) resulted in increased accumulation of GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications, and tended to occur simultaneously with GCRs. Overall, our study highlights the versatility of MLPA as a technique for rapidly analyzing GCRs, which may be useful in genetic analysis of pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy.  \n",

To do this, researchers use a concept called a \"free energy funnel,\" which tells them which parts of the proteins will fit together nicely and form a strong bond. The researchers then use a special computer program to explore all possible ways that the two proteins might fit together based on this information. However, exploring all possible ways that two proteins might fit together can take a long time, so the researchers use a technique called \"semi-definite programming-based underestimation\" (SDU) to speed up the process. This technique involves finding the lowest possible energy levels for different ways that the proteins might fit together and then using that information to guide the search to find the best possible solution. The researchers found that using this technique made the computer program much more efficient and allowed them to make much more accurate predictions about how the two proteins would fit together.  \n",
